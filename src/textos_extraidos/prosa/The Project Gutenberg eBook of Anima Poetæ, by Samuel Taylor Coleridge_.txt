of samuel taylor coleridge which the poet nephew and henry nelson coleridge published in 1835 was popular book from the ﬁrst and has won the approval of two generations of readers unlike the biographia literaria or the original and revised versions of the friend which never had their day at all or the aids to reﬂection which passed through many editions but now seems to have delivered its message the table talk is still well known and widely read and that not only by students of literature the task which the editor set himself was difﬁcult one but it lay within the powers of an attentive listener possessed of good memory and those rarer gifts of reﬁned and scholarly taste sound and luminous common sense he does not attempt to reproduce coleridge conversation or monologue or impassioned harangue but he preserves and notes down the detached fragments of knowledge and wisdom which fell from time to time from the master lips here are the balmy sunny islets of the blest and the intelligible an unvexed and harbour ous archipelago very sparingly if at all have those pithy sentences and weighty paragraphs been trimmed or pruned by the pious solicitude of the memorialist but it must be borne in mind that the unities are more or less consciously observed alike in the matter of the discourse and the artistic presentation to the reader there is in short not merely mechanic but an organic regularity in the composition of the work whole sage who has seen men and cities who has read widely and shaped his thoughts in peculiar mould is pouring out his stores of knowledge the garnered fruit of life of study and vii viii the project gutenberg ebook of anima poetæ by samuel taylor coleridge https the beneﬁt of an apt learner discreet and appreciative disciple day comes when the marvellous lips are constrained to an endless silence and it becomes the duty and privilege of the beloved and honoured pupil to snatch from forgetfulness and to hand down to posterity the great tradition of his master eloquence labour of love so useful and so fascinating was accomplished by the gifted editor of the table talk and it was accomplished once all the compilation of new table talk if it were possible would be mistake and an impertinence the present collection of hitherto unpublished aphorisms reﬂections confessions and soliloquies which want of better name i have entitled anima

few who would listen or might understand the ceaseless and curious workings of his imagination but from youth to age and were his silent conﬁdants his never failing friends by night and day more than ﬁfty of these remarkable documents are extant the earliest of the series which dates from 1795 and which is known the gutch memorandum book was purchased in 1868 by the trustees of the british museum and is now exhibited in the king library it consists the most part of fragments of prose and verse thrown off at the moment and stored up future use in poem or lecture or sermon few of these fragments were printed in the literary remains 4 vols and others are to be found pp 103 5 6 9 et passim in herr brandl samuel taylor coleridge and the english romantic school the poetical fragments are printed in extenso in coleridge poetical works macmillan 1893 pp few specimens of the prose fragments have been included in the ﬁrst chapter of this work one of the latest an unﬁnished folio contains the autobiographic note of 1832 portions of which were printed in gillman life of coleridge pp and mass of unpublished matter consisting mainly of religious exercises and biblical criticism of the intervening collection of of all shapes sizes and bindings detailed description would be tedious and out of place their contents may be roughly divided into diaries of tours in germany the lake district scotland sicily and italy notes projected and accomplished works rough drafts of poems schemes of metre and metrical experiments notes lectures on shakspere and other dramatists quotations from books of travel from greek latin german and italian classics with and without critical comments innumerable fragments of metaphysical and theological speculation and commingled with this unassorted medley of facts and thoughts and fancies an occasional and intermitted record of personal feeling of love and friendship of disappointment and regret of penitence and resolve of faith and hope in the unseen hitherto but little use has been made of this accumulation of literary material few specimens curiosities of literature they might have been called were contributed by coleridge himself to southey omniana of 1812 and further selection of some ﬁfty fragments gleaned from and 22 and from third unnumbered book now in my possession were printed by coleridge in the ﬁrst volume of the literary remains under the heading omniana the omniana of 1812 were in many instances by coleridge before they were included in southey volumes and in the later issue here and there the editor has given shape and articulation to an unﬁnished or sentence the earlier and later omniana together with the fragments which were published by allsop in his letters conversations and recollections of coleridge in 1836 were included by the late thomas ashe in his reprint of the table t alk bell 1884 ix x xi xii the project gutenberg ebook of anima poetæ by samuel taylor coleridge https fourteen or

extended use of the in the construction of his second volume or possibly the publication of supplementary volume of notes or omniana transcripts which were made this purpose are extant and have been placed at my disposal by the kindness of henry watson who inherited them from her grandmother gillman i may add that few quotations from diaries of tours in the lake country and on the continent are to be found in the appended to the two volumes of letters of samuel t aylor coleridge which were issued in the spring of the present year to publish the in extenso would be impracticable if even after the lapse of sixty years since the death of the writer it were permissible they are private books and rightly and properly have been regarded sacred trust by their several custodians but it is none the less certa in that in disburthening himself of the ideas and imaginations which pressed upon his consciousness in committing them to writing and carefully preserving them through all his wanderings coleridge had mind that they should perish utterly the invisible pageantry of thought and passion which ever ﬂoated into his spiritual ken the perpetual hope the that the veil of the senses would be rent in twain and that he and not another would be the ﬁrst to lay bare the mysteries of being and to solve the problem of the these was the breath of his soul it was his fate to wrestle from night to morn with the angel of the vision and of that unequal combat he has left by way of warning or encouragement broken but an inspired and inspiring record hints and ﬁrst thoughts he bade us regard the contents of his cogitabilia rather than cogitata not ﬁxed opinions and yet acts of obedience to the apostolic command of try all things hold fast that which is good rather acts of obedience to the compulsion of his own genius to take pen and write in book all the words of the vision the aim of the present work however imperfectly accomplished has been to present in compendious shape collection of unpublished aphorisms and sentences and at the same time to enable the reader to form some estimate of those strange to which coleridge devoted so much of his intellectual energies and by means of which he hoped to pass through the mists and shadows of words and thoughts to steadier contemplation to the apprehension if not the comprehension of the mysteries of truth and being the various excerpts which i have selected publication are arranged far possible in chronological order they begin with the beginning of coleridge literary career and are carried down to the summer of 1828 when he accompanied wordsworth and his daughter dora on six months tour on the continent the series of which belong to the remaining years of his life were devoted the most part to commentary on the old and new testament to theological controversy and to metaphysical disquisition whatever interest they may have possessed or still possess appeals to the student not to the general reader with his inveterate love of humorous or facetious titles coleridge was pleased to designate these serious and abstruse dissertations the flycatchers my especial thanks are due to amy lady coleridge who in accordance with the known wishes of the late lord coleridge has afforded every facility collating my own transcripts of the and those which were made by my father and other members of my family with

short did not the almighty create an absolutely inﬁnite number of almighties the hollowness and impiety of the argument will be felt by considering that suppose universal happiness perfection of the moral well natural world still the whole objection applies just forcibly at this moment the malignity of the deity i shudder even at the assumption of this affrightful and satanic language is manifested in the creation of archangels and cherubs and the whole company of pure intelligences burning in their unquenchable felicity equally in the creation of neros and tiberiuses of stone and

the measure that it was grown far ﬁner ﬁgure change where there had been positive substitution thus then it appears that the sole justiﬁcation of those who offended by the vice and misery of the created world far we know it impeach the power and goodness of the almighty making the proper cause of such vice and misery to have been defect either of power or appears i say that their sole justiﬁcation rests on an argument which has nothing to with vice and misery vice and an argument which would hold equally good in heaven in an argument which it might be demonstrated human being in state of happiness could ever have argument which millennium would annihilate and which yet would hold equally good then now but even in point of metaphysic the whole rests at last on the conceivable now i appeal to every man internal consciousness if he will but sincerely and in brotherly simplicity silence the bustle of argument in his mind and the ungenial feelings that mingle with and ﬁll up the mob and then ask his own intellect whether supposing he could conceive the creation of positively inﬁnite and beings and whether supposing this not only possible but real this has exhausted his notion of creatability whether the intellect by an unborn and original law of its essence does not demand of inﬁnite power more than merely inﬁnity of number inﬁnity of sorts and orders let him have created this inﬁnity of inﬁnites still there is space in the imagination the creation of ﬁnites but instead of these let him again create inﬁnites yet still the same space is left it is way ﬁlled up i feel too that the whole rests on miserable sophism of applying to an almighty being such words all why were not all gods but there is all in creation it is composed of inﬁnites and the imagination bewildered by heaping inﬁnites on inﬁnites and wearying of demanding increase of number to number which it conceives already inﬁnite deserted by images and mocked by words whose sole substance is the

of the leaf and spenser throughout and you can not but feel what gillman meant to convey what is the solution this i i must premise that there is synthesis of intellectual insight including the mental object the organ of the correspondent being indivisible and this deep truth because the objectivity consists in the universality of its when it sees and millions see even so and the seeing of the millions is what constitutes to and to each of the millions the objectivity of the sight the equivalent to common synthesis of this i say and of proper external object which we call fact now this it is which we ﬁnd in religion it is more than philosophical is other and more than historical fact it is not made up by the addition of the one to the other but it is the identity of both the now this being understood i proceed to say using the term objectivity arbitrarily i grant this identity of truth and fact that milton hid the poetry in or transformed not the poetry into this objectivity while shakspere in all things the divine opposite or antithetic correspondent of the divine milton transformed the objectivity into poetry observed peculiar to the hamlet that it alone of all shakspere plays presented to him moving along befor him while in others it was moving indeed but with which he himself moved equally in all and with all and without any external something by which the motion was manifested even man would move in balloon sensation of motion but not sight of moving and having been moved and why is this because of all the characters of shakspere plays hamlet is the only chara cter with which by from the rest of the dramatis personæ the ﬁt and capable reader identiﬁes himself the representation of his own contemplative and strictly proper and very own being action belongs to others the moment we call it our own the events of the play with all the characters move because you stand still in the other plays your identity is equally diffused over all of parts can you say in hamlet they are moving but ever it is we or that period and portion of human action which is uniﬁed into dream even in dream the personal unity is diffused and severalised divided to the sight though united in the dim feeling into sort of reality even so it is with the styles of milton and same weight of effect from the exceeding felicity subjectively of shakspere and the exceeding
