in the middle of high summer military expedition was advancing slowly down the dusty country road that led towards district of luzern the bright actually more than bright sun dazzled down over swaying armour serving to cover human bodies over prancing horses over helmets and parts of faces over equine heads and tails over ornaments and plumes and stirrups big snowshoes to the right and to the left of the shining military expedition spread out meadows with thousands of fruit trees in them up far hills that looming up out of the distance beckoned and had the same effect light and carefully painted window dressing it was before noon and the heat was already oppressive it was meadowy heat heat contained in grass hay and dust thick clouds of dust were being thrown up that sometimes descended like veil over parts and sections of the army sluggishly ploddingly carelessl y the long cavalcade moved forward sometimes it looked like shimmering and elongate d snake sometimes like lizard of enormous the project gutenberg ebook of the battle of sempach by robert walser https like large piece of cloth richly embroidered with ﬁgures and colourful shapes and ceremoniously trailed with ladies elderly and domineering ones far i concerned accustomed to dragging trains behind them in all this military might meth od and way of doing things in the stamping of feet and the clinking of weapons in this rough and ready clatter lurked an far i concerned that was uniform something impudent full of conﬁdence something upsetting slow ly pushing to one side all these knights were conversing far their mouths would allow them in joyful verbal banter with each other peals of laughter rang out and this sound was admirably suited to the bright tones emitted by weapons and chains and golden belts the morning sun still appeared to caress good deal of brass and ﬁner metal the sounds of tin whistles ﬂew sunward now and again one of the many footmen walking if on stilts would tender to his mounted lord delicate titbit stuck on silver fork right up to his swaying saddle wine was drunk on the move poultry consumed and nothing edible spat out with an carefree amiability this was earnest war involving chivalry they were riding to but more of punitive expedition statutory rape bloody scornful histrionic things everybody there thought so and everybody saw already the heap of f heads that would redden the meadow among the leaders of the expedition was many wonderful noble young man splendidly attired sitting on horseback like male angel ﬂown down from blue uncertain heaven many one had taken off his helmet to make things more comfortable himself and given it to an attendant to carry by doing so he displayed to the air peculiarly ﬁnely drawn face that was mixture of innocence and exuberance they were telling the latest jokes and discussing the most stories of courtly women the serious ones in their company they tolerated best they could it seemed today if pensive expression was deemed to be improper and unchivalrous the hair of the young knights who had taken their helmets off shone and smelt of oil and unguents and smelling water that they had poured on it if it had been matter of riding to visit coquette to sing her charming love songs their hands from which the iron gauntlets had been taken off did not look like those of warriors but manicured and pampered slender and white like the hands of young girls only one person in the wild procession was serious already his outward appearance armour that was deep black broken up with tender gold indicated how the person it covered thought he was the noble duke leopold of austria this man did not speak word and seemed completely lost in anxious thoughts his face looked like that of person who is being pestered by ﬂy that is impudently ﬂying round his eye this ﬂy may well have been presentiment that something bad was going to happen smile that was permanently both contemptuous and sad played over his mouth he kept his head lowered the whole world however cheerful it looked seemed to him to roll and thunder angrily or was it just the thunder of the trampling hooves of horses the army was now passing over wooden bridge that spanned the river reuss nevert heless something foreshadowing misfortune hovered horribly around the duke bodily form the army stopped near the little town of sempach it was now about two in the afternoon it may have been three it was matter of indifference to the knights what the time might be far they were concerned it could have been eight at they would have found that quite in order they were already terribly bored and found even the project gutenberg ebook of the battle of sempach by robert walser https trace of military discipline laughable it was dull moment it was like parade ground manoeuvre how they jumped from their saddles to take up position wanted to laugh any more they had already laughed so much yawning and exhaustion had set in even the horses seemed to understand that all one could now was yawn the servants on foot tucked into the remnants of the food and wine quaffed and scoffed what there was still left to scoff and quaff how ridiculous this whole expedition appeared to all concerned this shabby little town that was still holding out how stupid it all was the call of horn rang out suddenly through the frightful heat and boredom it left one or two more attentive ears particularly inquisitive to what it might be listen there it is again it really did sound out again and it could generally have been believed that it was now ringing out from not so far away all good things come in threes lisped facetious fop sound one more time horn and time marched on people had become somewhat now in addition frightened if the thing had grown wings and was riding on ﬁery monsters in that direction consumed by ﬂames and shouting setting up long cry we coming it was in truth if subterranean world had suddenly received breath of fresh air breaking in through the hard earth above the sound was like the opening up of dark precipice and it seemed if the sun were shining down now out of darkened sky even more glowingly even more harshly but light coming down out of hell and not out of heaven people laughed there are moments when man thinks he ought to smile when really what he feels is the icy grip of terror the mood of military expedition made up of many men is at the end of the day not very different from the mood of single and solitary individual the whole of the landscape in its stiﬂing white heat now seemed to be still making hooting noise it had turned into the sounds of horns and now there entered without any more ado into the range of horns being blown if from an opening the crowd of men from whom the sound had gone out now the landscape was featureless the sky and the earth in summer came together something solid the season disappeared geographical location tilting yard bellicose play area had become battleﬁeld nature plays part in battle everything depends on luck the calibre of the weaponry one crowd of people and another crowd of people the rushing forward to all appearances heated crowd drew nearer and the crowd of knights stood ﬁrm seeming once to have knit together lads of iron held their lances out in front of them so that you could have driven coach and four over the resulting bridge so densely packed were the knights and so unsurprisingly lance after lance stuck out immobile unmovable just the thing one might have thought one of the pushing pressing human chests opposite to be spitted by here stupid wall of sharp points there men in shirts only half dressed here the art of war practise d in the most of ways there men in the grip of inarticulate anger one after another they ran forward boldly just to put an end to this despicable lack of enthusiasm and threw themselves onto the tip of lance crazy mad driven by rage and fury they ended up of course falling over one another on the ground without having been able even to inﬂict wound with their weapons on the plumed and helmeted louts of iron opposite they fell face down into the dusty horse dung left behind on the ground by noble mounts and so it befell nearly all these men in state of undress while the lances already reddened by their blood seemed to smile at them disdainfully the project gutenberg ebook of the battle of sempach by robert walser https that was nothing one saw oneself compelled to make use of trick in order to be on the side of humanity confronted by art either art or some lofty thought was called and that lofty thought in the shape of man of lofty face immediately stepped forward if pushed there by supernatural power and addressed his countrymen look after my wife and my children i make path through you and he threw himself forthwith so not to let cool his desire onto four or ﬁve lances and pulled down several more many he could force to his chest in the act of dying it was if he could not embrace these iron points enough and drag them into himself to be able to die with unlimited resou rces and to lie on the ground and turn into bridge men who then trampled over his body on the lofty thought that wanted to be trampled on nothing will ever again compare with such thrashing and the way in which those valley and mountain folk smashed that clumsy despicable wall and tore it and beat it to bits like tigers ripping to pieces defenceless herd of cows the knights had become almost totally defenceless since being hemmed in they could hardly move to the side mounted knights were popped from their horses like paper bags ﬁlled with air pop when you clap your hands on them the herdsmen weapons now proved frightful and their light summer clothing just right armour to the knights was that much more burdensome heads were stroked by only stroked apparently and turned out to have been severed more and more knights were being struck down horses overturned and the power and rage of the onslaught kept increasing the duke was killed outright it would have been miracle had he not been killed those who were raining down blows shou ted they did so if it were appropriate if just killing were too slight an annihilation only half measure heat steam the smell of blood dirt and dust and the shouting and yelling merged in wild diabolical turmoil the dying hardly even felt the onset of their death they died so quickly they suffocated in droves in their showy iron armour those threshing ﬂails what further comment need be made each of them would gladly have given damn had they still been able to fine noblemen drowned in their hundreds they were drownded in the nearby lake of sempach they were drownded becau they were pushed into the water like cats and dogs they overbalanced and fell over one another in their elegant pointed was real shame the most splendid armour plating could only vouchsafe to its wearer oblivion and the realisation of this frightening presentiment was not contradicted what did it matter now that at home in the aargau or in swabia knights owned land and people had beautiful wife servants maidservants fruit trees ﬁelds and woods and collected taxes and enjoyed the ﬁnest privileges that only made dying in these pools of water between the pressing down knee of crazy herdsman and piece of earth more bitter and more wretched the warhorses in their uncontrolled ﬂight naturally stamped on their own masters many knights in the abruptness of their desire to dismount got caught up in the stirrups with their silly but fashio nable footwear and were left hanging from them so that they bumped themselves over the grass bleeding from the backs of their heads their shocked eyes in the meantime before they closed good saw the sky burn above them like an angry ﬂame herdsmen also died of course but every one and combatant who died there were always ten armour and wrapped up ones the battle of sempach teaches us in fact how dreadfully stupid it is to wrap up well if only those puppets had been able to move yes they would have done some did manage to so so that they were ﬁnally able to free themselves from that totally unbearable thing they were carrying on their body i am ﬁghting with slaves how disgu sting cried handsome youth with yellowish hair falling down to his shoulders and sank to the ground the project gutenberg ebook of the battle of sempach by robert walser https in his fair face by vicious blow where he fatally wounded bit the grass with his smashed teeth few herdsmen whose deadly weapons had gone missing from their hands pulled down like wrestlers in wrestling ring their opponents from below by the scruf f of the neck and head or threw themselves avoiding counter blows at the throat of knight and throttled him strangling him to death meanwhile it had started to go dark the dying light still glowed in trees and bushes while the sun went down among the dusky foothills of the alps like dead sad and handsome man the grim battle was over the pallid alps let their ﬁne cold brows hang down and in the background was the world burial details gathered up the dead went around quietly doing this lifted up the fallen who were lying on the ground and took them to the mass grave that other men had dug standards and armour were piled up together till they formed an imposing heap money and treasure together everything was set down in certain place most of these strong and simple men had grown silent and they were observing the captured valuables not without melancholic contempt walking up and down the meadows looking at the faces of the slain and washing off the blood when it pleased them to see what the sullied facial features looked like two youths were found at the foot of some shrubs with young bright faces lips still smiling even in death and with their arms around each other they lay on the ground one of them had suffered blow to the chest while the other had had his body ripped open there was work them to till late at night after that torches were used to ﬁnd corpses they came across the body of arnold von winkelried and beheld him with reverence when the men buried him they sang with deep voices one of their simple songs there was more pomp under the circumstances there were priests there what would one have done with priests praying and thanking god the victory had to happen quietly without church candl es then they went home and after few days they were scattered back again in their high valleys they were working serving saving looking after businesses doing what needed to be done and still spoke occasionally of the battle they had lived through though not much they were not hailed heroes well perhaps little in luzern on their triumphal entry to that town matter the days glided over it the days with their multiplicity of cares were harsh and raw even then in great deed does not strike from the calendar the arduous sequence of days
