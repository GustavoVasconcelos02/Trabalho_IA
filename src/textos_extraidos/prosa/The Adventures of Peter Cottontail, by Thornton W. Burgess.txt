ground you spring right around and grab them before they can run away so jimmy skunk crept around one side of the stump and peter rabbit crept around the other side suddenly peter thumped the ground

did that on said reddy fox such thing declared jimmy skunk i tell you it was joke on the part of peter rabbit and if you believe just look down there on the green meadows reddy fox looked there sat

looked hard at jimmy skunk but like all the other little meadow and forest people he has very great respect jimmy skunk and though he would have liked to quarrel with jimmy he thought it wisest not to instead he started after peter rabbit fast his legs could go now reddy fox can run very fast and when peter saw him coming peter knew that he would have to use his own long legs to the very best of his ability away they went across the green meadows jimmy skunk sitting on top of the hill could see the white patch on the seat of peter rabbit trousers bobbing this way and that way and right behind him was reddy fox now peter rabbit could run fast enough to keep away from reddy while you remember that peter eyes are so placed that he can see behind him without turning his head so he knew when reddy was getting too near in and out among the bushes along the edge of the green meadows they dodged and the more he had to run the angrier reddy fox grew he paid attention to where they were going his whole thought was of catching peter rabbit now when peter began to grow tired he began to work over towards farmer brown corn ﬁeld where he knew that farmer brown boy was hiding with bowser the hound dodging this way and that way peter worked over to the fence corner where jimmy skunk had watched blacky the crow get caught in snare he let reddy almost catch him then he dodged out into the

adventures of peter cottontail by thornton burgess https i guess that will fool him while panted reddy he sat down to get his breath when bowser came to the place where reddy had jumped on the stone wall he just grinned that too old trick to fool one minute said bowser to himself and he just made big circle so that in few minutes he had found reddy tracks again every trick that reddy had heard old granny fox tell about he tried in order to fool bowser the hound but it was of use at all bowser seemed to know exactly what reddy was doing and wasted time reddy was beginning to get worried he was getting dreadfully out of breath his legs ached his big plumey tail of which he is very very proud had become dreadfully heavy granny fox had warned him never never to run into the snug house they had dug unless he was obliged to to save his life that would tell bowser the hound where they lived and then they would have to move how reddy did wish that wise old granny fox would come to his relief he was running along the back of farmer brown pasture and he could hear bowser the hound altogether too near comfort he looked this way and he looked that way chance to escape just ahead of him

skunk had landed on him that morning baa baa baa cried the sheep and started to run reddy hung on tightly and away they raced across the pasture now bowser the hound trusts wholly to his nose to follow reddy fox or peter rabbit or his master farmer brown boy so he did not see reddy jump on the back of the sheep and of course when he reached the place where reddy had found his strange horse he was puzzled round and round and round and round bowser worked in circle but trace of reddy could he ﬁnd and all the time reddy sat behind the stone wall on the far side of the pasture getting his wind

out hunting and three days reddy fox had tried to ﬁnd something to tempt granny appetite he had brought in tender young chicken from farmer brown hen yard and he had stolen plump trout from billy mink

meet you at the briar this morning but that he grew so hungry thinking of those tender young carrots that he just had to come and get some before and he is very much obliged to you telling him about them he says they are the ﬁnest young carrots that he has ever tasted said the merry little breeze the heart of reddy fox was ﬁlled with rage but he did not let the merry little breeze know it he just smiled and sent the merry little breeze back to peter rabbit to tell him how glad he was that peter enjoyed the carrots and to invite peter to meet him the next morning on the edge of the old briar at

waited slowly the minutes went by until up from behind the purple hills came jolly round red peter rabbit reddy stopped grinning perhaps said he to himself peter is waiting on the edge of the old briar and was going to try to fool so reddy hurried over to the old briar and sure enough there was peter rabbit on the edge of it when peter saw him coming he dodged in behind big clump of friendly old brambles reddy came up with his broadest smile good morning peter rabbit said reddy shall we go over to that sweet clover bed original peter put one hand over his mouth to hide smile oh said he i was so dreadfully hungry sweet clover that i could wait until and so i went over two hours ago i hope you will excuse reddy fox i certainly appreciate your kindness in telling of that new sweet clover

out reddy fox was staring and staring at the old straw hat and he was smiling now he actually looked frightened it gave peter an idea he made three long hops straight towards reddy fox all the time

laugh just he had before what the joke peter rabbit tell so that i can laugh too begged reddy fox why said peter rabbit when he could get his breath the joke is that the monster that frightened you so was the old straw hat of farmer brown boy and i was underneath it ha ha ha ho ho ho then reddy fox knew just how badly peter rabbit had fooled him with snarl he sprang right over the bramble bush at peter rabbit but peter was watching and darted away along one of his own special little paths through the old briar reddy tried to follow but the brambles tore his clothes and scratched his face and stuck in his feet finally he had to give it up tom and the adventures of peter cottontail by thornton burgess https angry he tinned back home and he left the old briar he could still hear peter rabbit laughing xi shadow the weasel gets lost ll the green meadows had heard how peter rabbit had frightened reddy fox with an old straw hat and everywhere that reddy went some one was sure to shout after him reddy fox is ﬁne to see he brave brave can be he meets an old straw hat then he know where he at then reddy would lose his temper and chase his tormentors most of all he wanted to catch peter rabbit he lay in wait peter in fence corners and behind bushes and trees but somehow peter seemed always to know that reddy was there in the old briar peter was safe reddy had tried to follow him there but he had found that it was of use at all peter paths were so narrow and the brambles tore reddy clothes and scratched him so that he had to give it up reddy was thinking of this one day he sat on his scowling over at the old briar patch and then all of sudden he thought of shadow the weasel shadow is so slim that he can go almost anywhere that any one else can and he is so ﬁerce that nearly all of the little meadow people are terribly afraid of him reddy smiled it was mean wicked crafty smile then he hopped up and hurried to ﬁnd shadow the weasel and tell him his plan shadow listened and then he too began to smile it easy reddy fox the easiest thing in the world we get peter rabbit just sure fat hens are good eating said he they started the old briar reddy plan was very simple shadow the weasel was to follow peter rabbit along peter narrow little paths and drive peter out of the old briar on to the green meadows where reddy fox could surely catch him so reddy fox sat down to wait while shadow started into the old briar peter rabbit heard him coming and of course peter began to run now when peter ﬁrst made his home in the old briar he had foreseen that some day shadow the weasel might come to hunt him there so peter had made dozens and dozens of little paths twisting and turning and crossing and recrossing in the most puzzling way of course peter himself knew every twist and turn of every one of them but shadow had not gone very far before he was all mixed up he kept his sharp little nose to the ground to smell peter footsteps but peter kept crossing his own tracks so often that pretty soon shadow could not tell which path peter had last taken peter led him farther and farther into the middle of the old briar right there shadow came to great big puddle of water peter had jumped clear across it you know peter legs are long and meant jumping now shadow hates to get his feet wet and when he reached the puddle he stopped he glared with ﬁerce little red eyes across at peter rabbit sitting on the other side then he started around the edge peter waited until shadow was almost around and then he jumped back across the puddle there was nothing shadow to but go back around which he did of course peter just did the same thing over again all the time in his sleeve shadow the weasel was growing the adventures of peter cottontail by thornton burgess https angrier finally he grew so angry that he tried to jump the puddle himself and in he fell with great splash when shadow crawled out wet and muddy peter had disappeared and shadow could tell which path he had taken worse still he did know which path to take to get out himself he tried one after another but after little while he would ﬁnd himself back at the puddle in the middle of the old briar shadow the weasel was lost yes sir shadow the weasel was lost in the old briar outside reddy fox waited and watche d but frightened peter rabbit came jumping out he expected what could it mean after long long time he saw some one very muddy and very wet and very tired crawl out of one of peter rabbit little paths it was shadow the weasel reddy took one good look at him and then he hurried away he did want to hear what shadow the weasel would say and he hurried across the green meadows he heard peter rabbit voice from the middle of the old briar if at ﬁrst you succeed try try again shouted peter rabbit reddy fox ground his teeth xii the plot of two scamps ammy jay looking around mischief found reddy fox sitting on his with his chin in both hands and looking if he had friend in the world

his breath just then blacky the crow gave sharp caw caw caw that meant that blacky saw something and almost at once peter heard sound that sometimes ﬁlled his heart with fear but which now ﬁlled it with great joy it was the voice of bowser the hound reddy fox heard it too and he did stop to look under the big rock little later peter very cautiously crawled out of his resting place and climbed up where he could look over the green meadows way over on the far side he could see reddy fox running at the top of his speed and behind him was bowser the hound my but that was tight place said peter

what looked like gray paper it was fastened to bush just above little path leading to the very spot where peter lay fast asleep johnny chuckled again then off he hurried he sat down on top of little hill pretty soon reddy fox came along through the hollow below hello reddy fox you want to know how you can catch peter rabbit asked johnny reddy looked up he did know just what to say he knew that johnny chuck and peter had always been the very best of friends still friends fall out sometimes and perhaps johnny and peter had reddy decided that he would be polite i certainly johnny chuck he

reddy and johnny had guessed right away what the trouble was he hurried over to tell peter rabbit then the two little scalawags hunted up jimmy skunk and bobby coon to tell them and the four hid near the lone little path to wait reddy return pretty soon reddy came limping along even johnny chuck was surprised at the way reddy face had swelled it was plastered all over with mud and he was sorry sight indeed bobby coon appeared very much aston ished to see reddy in such condition though of course johnny chuck had told him all about how reddy had run head ﬁrst into the home of old hornet and her family the day before bobby stepped out in the lone little path why reddy fox what has happened to you he exclaimed reddy did see the others hiding in the long grass he did want bobby coon to know that he had been so careless to run his head into hornets nest so he told wrong story he put on long face that is it was long he could make it considering that it was so swelled i had most terrible accident bobby coon said reddy sighing pitifu lly it happened yesterday i was returning from an errand over beyond the hill just i was coming through the deepest part of the wood i heard some one crying of course i stopped to ﬁnd out what the matter was of course interrupted bobby coon certainly to be sure of course reddy looked at him suspiciously but went on with his tale right down in the thickest blackest place i found one of unc billy possum children being worried to death by digger the badger i could see that little possum hurt of course not broke in bobby coon so i jumped in and tackled old man badger and i had him almost whipped when i slipped over the edge of big rock on the side of the hill it took the skin off my face and bruised the adventures of peter cottontail by

even after he was well he would keep his head bound up and would limp down to the smiling pool some mud every day then when peter rabbit came near enough reddy would catch him so day after day reddy limped down to the smiling pool he kept his head tied up if it was bad ever and he walked he groaned if in great pain even some of those who hated him most began to feel little bit sorry reddy fox

behind him without turning his head reddy fox did not know this or if he did he had forgotten it very slowly and craftily the closed eye opened wee bit and in that line of yellow was hungry look peter

possum was sitting in his doorway in his big hollow tree in the green forest when peter rabbit came hurrying up peter hardly waited to say good morning before he began to tell unc billy all about his

rabbit ran about this way and that over the green meadows and through the green forest if he had something on his mind jimmy skunk noticed it so did billy mink and bobby coon but peter would stop to explain indeed he was always in such hurry that he would stop at all but when he met them would shout hello over his shoulder and keep right on running unc possum was the only one who guessed what it meant unc billy grinned he watched peter running about with such serious and important air brer rabbit is trying dreadful hard to fool hisself ah reckon he looking fo place to curl up and try to sleep all winter said unc billy unc billy had guessed just right peter was looking place to curl up to sleep all winter peter was too lazy to dig new house himself then it was too late in the fall anyway he would just ﬁnd some old deserted house that some of jimmy skunk relatives or johnny chuck relations had given up using so peter went poking into every old house he knew of trying to ﬁnd one that was so that it would at last he found one that he thought would be just the place and peter chuckled to himself he planned how he would curl up in the bedchamb er way down at the end of the long hall nobody ever guess where i am he said to himself and laughed aloud then peter remembered that unc billy possum had told him that it was necessary to eat great deal so to be very fat before going to sleep that was the way to keep warm all winter so peter started out to grow fat this would be fun the very best kind of fun there is nothing peter rabbit loves more than to ﬁll his stomach unless it is to satisfy his curiosity peter rabbit stomach is thing that most amazing it takes so long to ﬁll it up his time is short lazing perhaps this is the reason why when peter is eating he wants to loaf aroun d and watch other people work anyway peter is tremendous eater and now that he wanted to grow fat he felt that he must eat more than ever so he began at once to eat and eat and eat but there was one very important thing that peter had forgotten he had quite forgotten that it was now late in the fall and the tender young green things which peter dearly loves to eat were gone he could longer go down to the sweet clover patch and ﬁll himself full to bursting farmer brown had taken away all the cabbages and carrots and turnips that had made his garden so attractive to peter so now peter had to hunt what he had to eat that made great deal of running about and it is very hard work to grow fat when one runs about the more peter ate the more he had to hunt his food and the more he had to hunt his food the more he had to run about and the more he had to run about the more he hurried and the faster he ran now of course running takes fat of oh dear cried peter rabbit getting fat is not easy i

more of course it just happened that unc billy possum was right over near the old house built by grandfather skunk long time ago which peter rabbit had decided to sleep in all winter it just happened that he saw peter when he ﬁnally went down to the little bedchamber at the end of the long hall to curl up and try to go to sleep unc billy grinned then he chuckled finally he laughed until his fat sides shook ah reckon ah gwine to have some fun with brer rabbit said unc billy still chuckling he trotted off through the green forest he went over to bobby coon house and found bobby who had been out all night just getting ready bed but bobby is always ready to play joke and when unc billy told him about peter rabbit and what fun it would be to give peter scare bobby scrambled down from his hollow tree right away then they hunted up jimmy skunk and the three started the old house of grandfather skunk where peter rabbit was trying to go to sleep the winter ah done tell peter that when he

beckoned to bobby coon and jimmy skunk to come listen they could hear long sighs from way down in the bedchamber at the end of the long hall they heard peter twist and turn he tried to make himself comfortable but when they heard him saying verse over and over to try to make himself go to sleep they had to clap their hands over their mouths to keep from laughing out loud when they grew tired of listening unc billy whispered to jimmy skunk jimmy skunk grinned and then he crept little way down the long hall and began to scratch with his stout claws if he were digging when he stopped unc billy put his mouth down close to the doorway and barked nearly like reddy fox he could then jimmy began to dig again and pretty soon unc billy barked again then all three stole softly away and hid behind some bushes ah reckon brer rabbit is right smart instead of going to sleep fo the winter chuckled unc billy the adventures of peter cottontail by thornton burgess https peter rabbit learns his lesson eter rabbit curled up in the little bedchamber at the end of the long hall in the old house made long time ago by grandfather skunk twisted and turned and tried to make himself feel sleepy but the harder he tried the more he seemed to feel then he began to think of reddy and granny fox and what would happen if by any chance they should ﬁnd him there fast asleep and right while he was think ing about it he heard noise that made him jump so that he bumped his head peter did think anything about the bump on his head sir peter did even notice it he was too frightened he held his breath and listened while his heart went there it was again that noise he had heard befor some one was in the long dark hall there was doubt about it he could hear claws scratching whoever it was was digging digging the very thought made every hair on peter rabbit stand on end he knew that johnny chuck had gone to sleep the winter he knew that jimmy skunk could walk right in without any trouble and that jimmy never takes any trouble that he can avoid he knew that bobby coon and unc billy possum go into houses under ground unless they have to to get away from danger and very seldom then if some one was digging in the long dark hall it could mean but one at it must be some one too big to get in without making the hall larger and the only ones he could think of were bowser the hound and reddy and granny fox peter shivered and shook unlike johnny chuck house this one had back door if it bowser the hound he may get tired and go away anyway i can soon tell he will sniff and snuff and blow the sand out of his nose thought peter and strained his ears to hear the ﬁrst sniff but there were sniffs or snuffs instead peter heard sound that made his heart almost stop beating again it was bark bark that sounded very much like the bark of reddy fox and it came from just outside the door that could mean but one old granny fox was digging her way in to the little bedchamber while reddy kept watch outside oh dear oh dear why was i conte nt to live i always have lived whatever did i try to something i never was intended to cried peter to himself and shook with fright harder than ever there was nothing to but to sit still and wait peter sat still ever he could after little while the noise in the long dark hall stopped peter waited and waited but all was still and he began to feel better perhaps old granny fox did know that he was there at all and had grown tired of digging and had gone away peter waited long time and then peeped out into the long hall way up at the end he could see light where the doorway was and by this he knew that one was in the hall little by little his heart going peter crept up until he could peep outsi one was to be seen with his heart almost in his mouth peter sprang out and started the dear old briar fast his long legs could take him and then he heard sound that made him stop suddenly and sit up ha ha ha ho ho hoi hee hee hee there behind some bushes unc billy possum bobby coon and jimmy skunk were laughing ﬁt to kill themselves then peter knew that they had played joke on him and he shook his ﬁst at them but down in his heart he was glad he knew that he had learned his he had business to try to what old mother nature had never intended that he should of course these are not all of peter rabbit adventures oh my but there are so many other
