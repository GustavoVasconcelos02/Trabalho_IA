of those grim courtiers stood wondering at him john smith he had beene monster till powhatan 2 and his train had put themselves in their greatest braveries before Ô¨Åre upon seat like bedsted he sat covered with great robe made of rarowcun skinnes and all the tayles hanging by on either hand did sit young wench of 16 or 18 years and along on each side the house two rowe s of men and behind them many women with all their heads and shoulders painted red many of their heads bedecked with the white downe of birds but every one with somethi ng and great chain of white beads about their necks at his entrance before the king all the people gave great shout the queene of appamatuck was appointed to bring him water to wash his hands and another brought him bunch of feathers instead of towel to dry them having feasted him after their best barbarous manner they could long consultation was held but the conclusion was two great stones were brought before powhatan then many could laid hands on him dragged him to them and thereon laid his head and being ready with their clubs to beate out his braines pocahontas the king dearest daughter when intreaty could prevaile got his head in her armes and laid her owne upon his to save him from death whereat the emperour was contented he should live to make him hatchets and her bells beads and copper they thought him well of all occupations themselves the king himselfe will make his owne robes shooes bowes arrowes pots plant hunt or doe any thing so well the rest to conclude our peace thus it happened captaine argall 3 having entered into great acquaintance with japazaws an old friend of captaine smith and so to all our nation ever since hee discovered the countrie hard by him there was pocahontas whom captaine smith relations intituleth the numparell of virginia and tho she had beene many times preserver of him and the whole colonie yet till this accident shee was never seene at james towne since his departure being at patawomeke it seemes thinking her selfe unknown was easily by her friend japazaws perswaded to goe abroad with him and his wife to see the ship captaine argall had promised him copper kettle to bring her but to him promising way to hurt her but keepe her till they could conclude peace with her father the salvage this copper kettle would have done any thing it seemed by the relation tho she had seene and beene in many ships yet he caused his wife to faine how desirou s she was to see one and that he offered to beat her her importunitie till she wept but at last he told her if pocahontas would goe with her he was content and thus they betrayed the poore innocent pocahontas aboord where they were all kindly feasted in the cabin japazaws treading oft on the captaine foot to remember he had done his part the captaine when he saw his time perswaded pocahontas to the faining to have 4 5 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ix of 10 https conference with japazaws which was only that she should not perceive he was any way guiltie of her captivitie so sending her againe he told her before her friends she must goe with him and compound peace betwixt her countrie and us before she ever should see powhatan whereat the old jew and his wife began to howle and crie fast pocahontas that upon the captaine fair perswasions by degrees pacifying her selfe and japazaws and his wife with the kettle and other toys went merrily on shore and she to james towne messenger forthwith was sent to her father that his daughter pocahontas he loved so dearly he must ransome with our men swords pieces tooles he trecherously had stolne long before this master john rolfe an honest gentleman and of good behaviour had beene in love with pocahontas and she with him which thing at that instant i made knowne to sir thomas dale by letter from him wherein hee intreated his advice and she acquainted her brother with it which resolution sir thomas dale 4 well approved the bruit of this mariage came soone to the knowledge of powhatan thing acceptable to him appeared by his sudden consent within ten days he sent opachisco an old uncle of hers and two of his sons to see the manner of the mariage and to doe in that behalfe what they requested the conÔ¨Årmation thereof his deputie which was accordingly done about the Ô¨Årst of aprill and ever since we have had friendly trade and commerce well with powhatan himself all his subjects the lady rebecca 5 alias pocahontas daughter to powhattan by the diligent care of master john rolfe her husband and his friends taught to speake such english might well bee understood well instructed in christianitie and was become very formal and civil after our english manner she had also by him childe which she loved most dearely and the treasurer and company tooke order both the maintenance of her and it besides there were divers persons of great ranke and qualitie had beene very kinde to her and before she arrived at london captaine smith to deserve her former courtesies made her qualities knowne to the queene most excellent majestie and her court and writ little booke to this ef fect to the queene an abstract whereof followeth to the most high and vertuous princesse queene anne of gr eat brittanie most dmired q ueene the love i beare my god my king and countrie hath so oft emboldened in the worst of extreme dangers that now honestie doth constraine mee presume thus far beyond my selfe to present your majestie this short discourse if ingratitude be deadly poyson to all honest vertues i must bee guiltie of that crime if i should omit any meanes to bee thankful so it is that some ten yeers agoe being in virginia and taken prisoner by the power of powhatan their chiefe king i received from this great salvage exceeding great courtesie especially from his son nantaquaus the most manliest comeliest boldest spirit i ever saw in salvage and his sister pocahontas the king most deare and beloved daughter being but childe of twelve or thirteene yeers of age whose compassionate pitiful heart of desperate estate gave much cause to respect her i being the Ô¨Årst christian this proud king and his grim attendants ever saw and thus inthralled in their barbarous power i can not say i felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of those my mortal foes to prevent notwithstanding all their threats after some six weeks fatting among those salvage courtiers at the minute of my execution she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save mine and not only that but so prevaild with her father that i was safely conducted to james towne where i found about eight and thirtie miserable poore and sicke creatures to keepe possession of all those large territories of virginia such was the weaknesse of this poore commonw ealth had the salvages not fed us we directly had starved and this reliefe most gracious queene was commonly brought us by this lady pocahontas notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant fortune turned our peace to war this tender virgin would still not spare to dare to visit us and by her our jars have beene oft appeased and our wants still supplyed were it the policie of her father thus to imploy her or the ordinance of god thus to make her his instrument or her extraordinary 6 7 8 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics

affright her from comming through the irkesome woods and with watered eyes gave intelligence with her best advice to escape his furie which had hee knowne hee had surely slaine her james towne with her wild traine she freely frequented her father habitation and during the time of two or three yeeres she next under god was still the instrument to preserve this colonie from death famine and utter confusion which if in those times had once beene dissolved virginia might have line it was at our Ô¨Årst arrival to this day since then this businesse having beene turned and varied by many accidents from that i left it at it is most certaine after long and troublesome war after my departure betwixt her father and our colonie all which time shee was not heard of about two yeeres after she her selfe was taken prisoner being so detained neere two yeeres longer the colonie by that meanes was relieved peace concluded and at last rejecting her barbarous condition was maried to an english gentleman with whom at this present she is in england the Ô¨Årst christian ever of that nation the Ô¨Årst virginian ever spake english or had childe in mariage by an englishman matter surely if my meaning bee truly considered and well understood worthy prince understanding the small time i staid in london divers courtiers and others my acquaintances hath gone with mee to see her that generally concluded they did thinke god had great hand in her conversion and they have seen many english ladies worse favored proportioned and behaviored and since i have heard it pleased both the king and queene majestie honorably to esteeme her accompanied with that honorable lady the lady la warre and that honorable lord her husband and divers other persons of good qualities both publikely at the maskes and otherwise to her great satisfaction and content which doubtlesse she would have deserved had she lived to arrive in virginia 6 footnotes from smith generall historie of virginia powhatan

into after we had sailed an hour or two it began to snow and rain and to be bad weathe about the midst of the afternoon the wind increased and the seas began to be very rough and the hinges of the rudder broke so that we could steer longer with it but two men with much ado were fain to serve with couple of oars the seas were grown so great that we were much troubled and in great danger and night grew on anon master coppin bade us be of good cheer he saw the harbor we drew near the gale being stiff and we bearing great sail to get in split our mast in three pieces and were like to have cast away our shallop yet by god mercy recovering ourselves we had the Ô¨Çood with us and struck into the harbor now he that thought that had been the place was deceived it being place where not any of us had been before and coming into the harbor he that was our pilot did bear up northward which if he had continued we had been cast away yet still the lord kept us and we bare up an island before us and recovering of that island being compassed about with many rocks and dark night growing upon us it pleased the divine providence that we fell upon place of sandy ground where our shallop did ride safe and secure all that night and coming upon strange island kept our watch all night in the rain upon that island and in the morning we marched about it and found inhabitants at all and here we made our rendezvous all that day being saturday 10th of december on the sabbath day we rested and on monday we sounded the harbor and found it very good harbor our shipping we marched also into the land and found divers cornÔ¨Å elds and little running brooks place very good situation so we returned to our ship again with good news to the rest of our people which did much comfort their hearts some of us having good mind safety to plant in the greater isle we crossed the bay which is there Ô¨Åve or six miles over and found the isle about mile and half or two miles about all wooded and fresh water but two or three pits that we doubted of fresh water in summer and so full of wood we could hardly clear so much to serve us corn besides we judged it cold our corn and some part very rocky yet divers thought of it place defensible and of great security that night we returned again shipboard with resolution the next morning to settle on some of those places so in the morning after we had called on god direction we came to this resolution to go presently ashore again and to take better view of two places which we thought most Ô¨Åtting us we could not now take time further search or consideration our victuals being much spent especially our beer and it being now the 19th of december after our landing and viewing of the places so well we could we came to conclusion by most voices to set on the main land on the Ô¨Årst place on high ground where there is great deal of land cleared and hath been planted with corn three or four years ago and there is very sweet brook runs under the hill side and many delicate springs of good water can be drunk and where we may harbor our shallops and boats exceeding well and in this brook much good Ô¨Åsh in their seasons on the further 11 12

quarter of an english mile but there is enough so far off what people inhabit here we yet know not yet we have seen none so there we made our rendezvous and place some of our people about twenty resolving in the morning to come all ashore and to build houses but the next morning being thursday the 21st of december it was stormy and wet that we could not go ashore and those that remained there all night could nothing but were wet not having daylight enough to make them sufÔ¨Åcient court of guard to keep them dry all that night it blew and rained extremely it was so tempestuous that the shallop could not go on land so soon was meet they had victuals on land about eleven the shallop went off with much ado with provision but could not return it blew so strong and was such foul weath er that we were forced to let fall our anchor and ride with three anchors ahead friday the 22d the storm still continued that we could not get land nor they come to us aboard saturday the 23d so many of us could went on shore felled and carried timber to provide themselves stuf f building sunday the 24th our people on shore heard cry of some savages they thought which caused an alarm and to stand on their guard expecting an assault but all was quiet friday the 16th fair warm day toward this morning we determined to conclude of the military orders which we had begun to consider of before but were interrupted by the savages we mentioned formerly and while we were busied hereabout we were interrupted again there presented himself savage which caused an alarm he very boldly came all alone and along the houses straight to the rendezvous where we intercepted him not suffering him to go in undoubtedly he would out of his boldness he saluted us in english and bade us welcome he had learned some broken english among the englishmen that came to Ô¨Åsh at monhiggon and knew by name the most of the captains commanders and masters that usually come he was man free in speech so far he could express his mind and of seemly carriage we questioned him of many things he was the Ô¨Årst savage we could meet withal he said he was not of these parts but of morattiggon and one of the sagamores or lords thereof and had been eight months in these parts it lying hence day sail with great wind and Ô¨Åve days by land he discoursed of the whole country and of every province and of their sagam ores and their number of men and strength the wind beginning to rise little we cast horseman coat about him he was stark naked only leather about his waist with fringe about span long or little more he had bow and two arrows the one headed and the other unheaded he was tall straight man the hair of his head black long behind only short before none on his face at all he asked some beer but we gave him strong water and biscuit and butter and cheese and pudding and piece of mallard all which he liked well and had been acqu ainted with such amongst the english he told us the place where we now live is called patuxet and that about four years ago all the inhabitants died of an extraordinary plague and there is neither man woman nor child remaining indeed we have found none so there is none to hinder our possession or to lay claim unto it all the afternoon we spent in communication with him we would gladly have been rid of him at night but he was not willing to go this night then we thought to carry him on shipboard wherewith he was well content and went into the shallop but the wind was high and the water scant that it could not return back we lodged him that night at steven hopkin house and watched him the next day he went away back to the masasoits from whence he said he came who are our next bordering neighbors they are sixty strong he saith the nausites are near 14 15 16 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ix of 10 https of them and are hundred strong and those were they of whom our people were encountered we before related they are much incensed and provoke d against the english and about eight months ago slew three englishmen and two more hardly escaped by Ô¨Çight to monhiggon they were sir ferdinando gorge 8 men this savage told us he did likewise of the huggery that is Ô¨Åght that our discoverers had with the nausites and of our tools that were taken out of the woods which we willed him should be brought again otherwise we would right ourselves these people are ill affected toward the english by reason of one hunt master of ship who deceived the people and got them under color of trucking with them twenty out of this very place where we inhabit and seven men from the nausites and carried them away and sold them slaves like wretched man twenty pound man that cares not what mischief he doth his proÔ¨Åt saturday in the morning we dismissed the savage and gave him knife bracelet and ring he promised within night or two to come again and to bring with him some of the masasoits our neighbors with such beavers skins they had to truck with us saturday and sunday reasonable fair days on this day came again the savage and brought with him Ô¨Åve other tall proper men they had every man deer skin on him and the principal of them had wild cat skin or such like on the one arm they had most of them long hosen up to their groins close made and above their groins to their waist another leather they were altogether like the irish trousers they are of complexion like our english gipseys hair or very little on their faces on their heads long hair to their shoulders only cut before some trussed up before with feather like fan another hanging out these left according to our charge given him before their bows and arrows quarter of mile from our town we gave them entertainment we thought was Ô¨Åtting them they did eat liberally of our english victuals they made semblance unto us of friendship and amity they sang and danced after their manner like antics they brought with them in thing like which the principa l of them had about his waist little of their corn pounded to powder which put to little water they eat he had little tobacco in bag but none of them drank but when he liked some of them had their faces painted black from the forehead to the chin four or Ô¨Åve Ô¨Ångers broad others after other fashions they liked they brought three or four skins but we would not truck with them at all that day but wished them to bring more and we would truck all which they promised within night or two and would leave these behind them tho we were not willing they should and they brought us all our tools again which were taken in the woods in our men absence so because of the day we dismissed them so soon we could but samoset 9 our Ô¨Årst acquaintance either was sick or feigned himself so and

write of charity or say nothing his charity was star of the Ô¨Årst magnitude in the bright constellation of his vertues and the rays of it were wonderfully various and extensive his liberality to pious uses whether publick or private went much beyond the proportions of his little estate in the world many hundreds of pounds did he freely bestow upon the poor and he would with very forcible importunity press his neighbors to join with him in such beneÔ¨Åcences it was marvelous alacrity with which he imbr aced all opportunities of relieving any that were miserable and the good people of roxbury doubtless can not remember but the righteous god will how often and with what ardors with what arguments he became beggar to them collections in their assemblies to support such needy objects had fallen under his observation the poor counted him their father and repaired still unto him with Ô¨Ålial conÔ¨Ådence in their necessities and they were more than seven or eight or indeed than so many scores who received their portions of his bounty like that worthy and famous english general he could not perswade himself that he had anything but what he gave away but he drove mighty trade at such exercises he thought would furnish him with bills of exchange which he hoped after many days to Ô¨Ånd the comfort of and yet after all he would say like one of the most charitable souls that ever lived in the world that looking over his accounts he could nowhere Ô¨Ånd the god of heaven charged debtor there he did not put off his charity to be put in his last will many who therein shew that their charity is against their will but he was his own administrator he made his own hands his executors and his own eyes his overseers it has been remarked that liberal men are often men so they after many days Ô¨Ånd the bread with which they have been willing to keep other men alive the great age of our eliot was but agreeable to this remark and when his age had unÔ¨Åtted him almost all employments and bereaved him of those gifts and parts which once he had been accomplished with being asked how he did he would sometimes answer alas i have lost everything my understanding leaves my memo ry fails my utterance fails but i thank god my charity holds out still i Ô¨Ånd that rather grows than fails and i make question that at his death his happy soul was received and welcomed into the everlasting habitations by many scores got thither before him of such his charity had been liberal unto 11 12 33 34 35 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ix of 10 https besides these more substantial expressions of his charity he made the odors of that grace yet more fragrant unto all that were about him by that pitifulness and that peaceableness which rendered him yet further amiable if any of his neighborhood were in distress he was like brother born their adversity he would visit them and comfort them with most fraternal sympathy yea is not easy to recount how many whole days of prayer and fasting he has got his neighbors to keep with him on the behalf of those whose calamities he found himself touched withal it was an extreme satisfaction to him that his wife had attained unto considerable skill in physick and chirur gery which enabled her to dispense many safe good and useful medicines unto the poor that had occasion them and some hundreds of sick and weak and maimed people owed praises to god the beneÔ¨Åt which therein they freely received of her the good gentleman her husband would still be casting oil into the Ô¨Çame of that charity wherein she was of her own accord abundantly forward thus to be doing of good unto all and he would urge her to be serviceable unto the worst enemies that he had in the world never had any man fewer enemies than he but once having delivered something in his ministry which displeased one of his hearers the man did passionately abuse him it and this both with speeches and with writings that reviled him yet it happening not long after that this man gave himself very dangerous wound eliot immediately sends his wife to cure him who did accordingly when the man was well he came to thank her but she took rewards and this good man made him stay and eat with him taking notice of all the calumnies with which he had loaded him but by this carriage he molliÔ¨Åed and conquered the stomach of his reviler he was also great enemy to all contention and would ring aloud courfeu bell wherever he saw the Ô¨Åres of animosity when he heard any ministers complain that such and such in their Ô¨Çocks were too difÔ¨Åcult them the strain of his answer still was brother compass them and brother learn the meaning of those three little words bear forbear forgive yea his inclinations peace indeed sometimes almost made him to sacriÔ¨Åce right itself when there was laid before an assembly of ministers bundle of papers which contained certain matters of difference and contention between some people which our eliot thought should rather unite with an amnesty upon all their former quarrels he with some imitation of what constantine did upon the like occasion hastily threw the papers into the Ô¨Åre before them all and with zeal peace hot that Ô¨Åre said immediately brethren wonder not at what i have done i did it on my knees this morning before i came among you such an excess if it were one Ô¨Çowed from his charitable inclinations to be found among those which by follo wing the example of that man who is our peace come to be called the children of god very worthily might he be called an iren√¶us being all peace and the commendation which epiphanius gives unto the ancien t of that name did belong unto our eliot he was most blessed and most holy man he disliked all sorts of bravery but yet with an ingenious note upon the greek word in iii 15 he propounded that peace might brave it among us in short wherever he came it was like another old john with solemn and earnest persuasives to love and when he could say little else he would give that charge my children love one another finally was his charity which disposed him to continual applications and benedictions on those that he met withal he had an heart full of good wishes and mouth full of kind blessings them and he often made his expressions very wittily agreeable to the circumstances which he saw the persons in sometimes when he came into family he would call all the young people in it that so he might very distinctly lay his holy hands upon every one of them and bespeak the mercies of heaven them

the famous ancestral seat called westover at the home of colonel spotswood 14 colonel spotswood enchanted castle is on one side of the street and baker dozen of ruinous tenements on the other where so many german families had dwelt some years ago but are now removed ten miles higher in the fork of rappahannock to land of their own there had also been chapel about from the colonel house at the end of an avenue of cherry trees but some pious people had lately burned it down with intent to get another built nearer to their own homes here i arrived about three and found only spotswood at home who received her old acquaintance with many gracious smile i was carried into room elegantly set off with pier glasses the largest of which came soon after to an odd misfortune amongst other favorite animals that cheered this lady solitude brace of tame deer ran familiarly about the house and one of them came to stare at stranger but unluckily spying his own Ô¨Ågure in the glass he made spring over the that stood under it and shattered the glass to pieces and falling back upon the made terrible fracas among the china this exploit was so sudden and accompanied with such noise that it surprized and perfectly frightened spotswood but was worth all the damage to show the moderation and good humor with which she bore this disaster in the evening the noble colonel came home from his mines who saluted very civilly and spotswood sister miss theky who had been to meet him en cavalier was so kind too to bid welcome we talked over legend of old stories supped about 9 and then prattled with the ladies till it was time traveler to retire in the mean time i observed my old friend to be very uxorious and exceedingly fond of his children this was so opposite to the maxims he used to preach up before he was married that i could not forbear rubbing up the memory of them but he gave very turn to his change of sentiments by alleging that whoever brings poor gentlewoman into so solitary place from all her friends and acquaintance would be ungrateful not to use her and all that belongs to her with all possible tenderness we all kept snug in our several apartm ents till nine except miss theky who was the housewife of the family at that hour we met over pot of coffee which was not quite strong enough to give us the palsy after breakfast the colonel and i left the ladie s to their domestic affairs and took turn in the garden which has nothing beautiful but three terrace walks that fall in slopes one below another i let him understand that besides the pleasure of paying him visit i came to be instructed by so great master in the mystery of making of iron wherein he had led the way and was the tubal cain of virginia he corrected little there by assuring he was not only the Ô¨Årst in this country but the Ô¨Årst in north america who had erected regular furnace that they ran altogether upon 38 39 40 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics

must be content to make it only their own use and must be obliged to manufacture it when they have done that he hoped he had done the country very great service by setting so good an example our conversation on this subject continued till dinner which was both elegant and plentiful the afternoon was devoted to the ladies who showed one of their most beautiful walks they conducted through shady lane to the landing and by the way made drink some very Ô¨Åne water that issued from marble fountain and ran incessantly just behind it was covered bench where miss theky often sat and bewailed her virginity then we proceeded to the river which is the south branch of rappahannock about Ô¨Åfty yards wide and so rapid that the ferry boat is drawn over by chain and therefore called the rapidan at night we drank prosperity to all the colonel projects in bowl of rack punch and then retired to our devotions having employed about two hours in retirement i sallied out at the Ô¨Årst summons to breakfast where our conversation with the ladies like whip syllabub was very pretty but had nothing in it this it seems was miss theky birthday upon which i made her my compliments and wished she might live twice long married woman she had lived maid i did not presume to pry into the secret of her age nor was she forward to disclose it this humble reason lest i should think her wisdom fell short of her years we had michaelmas goose dinner of miss theky own raising who was now enough to forget the jeopardy of her dog in the afternoon we walked in meadow by the river side which winds in the form of horseshoe about germanna making it peninsula containing about four hundred acres rappahannock forks about fourteen miles below this place the northern branch being the larger and consequently must be the river that bounds my lord fairfax grant of the northern neck the sun rose clear this morning and so did i and Ô¨Ånished all my little affairs by breakfast it was then resolved to wait on the ladies on horseback since the bright sun the Ô¨Åne air and the wholesome exercise all invited us to it we forded the river little above the ferry and rode six miles up the neck to Ô¨Åne level piece of rich land where we found about twenty plants of ginseng with the scarlet berries growing on the top of the middle stalk the root of this is of wonderful virtue in many cases particularl y to raise the spirits and promote perspiration which makes it speciÔ¨Åc in colds and coughs the colonel complimented with all we found in return my telling him the virtues of it we were all pleased to Ô¨Ånd so much of this king of plants so near the colonel habitation and growing too upon his own land but were however surprized to Ô¨Ånd it upon level ground after we had been told it grew only upon the north side of stony mountains i carried home this treasure with much joy if every root had been graft of the tree of life and washed and dried it carefully this airing made us hungry so many hawks so that between appetite and very good dinner was difÔ¨Åcult to eat like philosopher in the afternoon the ladies walked about amongst all their little animals with which they amuse themselves and furnish the table the worst of it is they are so tenderhearted they shed silent tear every time any of them are killed at night the colonel and i quitted the threadbare subject of iron and changed the scene to politics he told the ministry had receded from their demand upon new england to raise standing salary all succeeding govern ors fear some curious members of the house of commons should inquire how the money was disposed of that had been raised in the other american colonies the support of their governors our conversation was interrupted by summons to supper the ladies to show their power had by this time brought us tamely to go to bed with our bellies full tho we both at Ô¨Årst declared positively against it so very pliable thing is frail man when women have the bending of him

of the redemption in of liber ty and moral agencies 15 the plain and obvious meaning of the words freedom and liberty in common speech is power opportunity or advantage that any one has to he pleases or in other words his being free from hindrance or impediment in the way of doing or conducting in any respect he wills i say not only doing but conducting because voluntary forbearing to sitting still keeping silence are instances of persons conduct about which liberty is exercised tho they are not so properly called doing and the contrary to liberty whatever name we call that by is person being hindered or unable to conduct he will or being necessitated to otherwise if this which i have mentioned be the meaning of the word liberty in the ordinary use of language i trust that none that has ever learned to talk and is unprejudiced will deny then it will follow that in propriety of speech neither liberty nor its contrary can properly be ascribed to any being or thing but that which has such faculty power or property is called will that which is possest of such thing will can not have any power or opportunity of doing according to its will nor be necessitated to act contr ary to its will nor be restrained from acting agreeably to it and therefore to talk of liberty or the contrary belonging to the very will itself is not to speak good sense if we judge of sense and nonsense by the original and proper signiÔ¨Åcation of words the will itself is not an agent that has will the power of choosing itself has not power of choosing that which has the power of volition or choice is the man or the soul and not the power of volition itself and he that has the liberty of doing according to his will is the agent or doer who is possest of the will and not the will which he is possest of we say with propriety that bird let loose has power and liberty to Ô¨Çy but not that the bird power of Ô¨Çying has power and liberty of Ô¨Çying to be free is the property of an agent who is possest of powers and faculties much to be cunning valiant bountiful or zealous but these qualities are the properties of men or persons and not the properties of properties 14 44 45 46 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ix of 10 https are two things that are contrary to this which is called liberty in commo n speech one is constraint the same is otherwise called force compulsion and coaction which is person being necessitated to thing contrary to his will the other is restraint which is his being hindered and not having power to according to his will but that which has will can not be the subject of these things i need say the less on this head locke having set the same thing forth with so great clearness in his essay on the human understanding but one thing more i would observe concerning what is vulgarly called liberty namely that power and opportunity one to and conduct he will or according to his choice is all that is meant by it without taking into the meaning of the word anything of the cause or original of that choice or at all considering how the person came to have such volition whether it was caused by some external motive or internal habitual bias whether it was determined by some internal antecedent volition or whether it happened without cause whether it was necessarily connected with something foregoin g or not connected let the person come by his volition or choice how he will yet if he is able and there is nothing in the way to hinder his pursuing and executing his will the man is fully and perfectly free according to the primary and common notion of freedom what has been said may be sufÔ¨Åcient to show what is meant by liberty according to the common notions of mankind and in the usual and primary acceptation of the word but the word used by arminians pelagians and others who oppose the calvinists has an entirely different signiÔ¨Åcation these several things belong to their notion of liberty that it consists in power in the will or certain sovereignty the will has over itself and its own acts whereby it determines its own volitions so not to be dependent in its determinations on any cause without itself nor determined by anything prior to its own acts indif ference belongs to liberty in their notion of it or that the mind previous to the act of volition be in equilibrio contingence is another thing that belongs and is essential to it not in the common acceptation of the word that has been already explained but opposed to all necessity or any Ô¨Åxt and certain connection with some previous ground or reason of its existence they suppose the essence of liberty so much to consist in these things that unless the will of man be free in this sense he has real freedom how much soever he may be at liberty to act according to his will moral agent is being that is capable of those actions that have moral quality and which can properly be denominated good or evil in moral sense virtuous or vicious commendable or faulty to moral agency belongs moral faculty or sense of moral good and evil or of such thing desert or worthiness of praise or blame reward or punishment and capacity which an agent has of being inÔ¨Çuenced in his actions by moral inducements or motives exhibited to the view of understanding and reason to engage to conduct agreeable to the moral faculty the sun is very excellent and beneÔ¨Åcial in its action and inÔ¨Çuence on the earth in warming it and causing it to bring forth its fruits but it is not moral agent its action tho good is not virtuous or meritorious fire that breaks out in city and consumes great part of it is very mischievous in its operation but is not moral agent what it does is not faulty or sinful or deserving of any punishment the brute creatures are not moral agents the actions of some of them are very proÔ¨Åtable and pleasant others are very hurtful yet seeing they have moral faculty or sense of desert and not act from choice guided by understanding or with capacity of reasoning and reÔ¨Çecting but only from instinct and are not capable of being inÔ¨Çuenced by moral inducements their actions are not properly sinful or virtuous nor are they properly the subjects of any such moral treatment what they moral agents are their faults or good deeds here it may be noted that there is circumstantial difference between the moral agency of ruler and subject i call it circum stantial because it lies only in the difference of moral inducements they are capable of being inÔ¨Çuenced by arising from the difference of circumstances ruler acting in that capacity only is not capable of being inÔ¨Çuenced by moral law and its sanctions of threatenings and promises rewards and punishments 47 48 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ix of 10 https subject is tho both may be inÔ¨Çuenced by knowledge of moral good and evil and therefore the moral agency of the supreme being who acts only in the capacity of ruler toward his creatures and never subject differs in that respect from the moral agency of created intelligent beings god actions and particularly those which are

these Ô¨Åne troop s so well provided with artillery that place not yet completely fortiÔ¨Åed and we hear with very strong garrison can probably make but short resistance the only danger i apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of indians who by consta nt practise are dextrous in laying and executing them and the slender line near four miles long which your army must make may expose it to be attacked by surprize in its Ô¨Çanks and to be cut like thread into several pieces which from their distance can not come up in time to support each other he smiled at my ignorance and

the silk and twine join key may be fastened this kite is to be raised when thunder appears to be coming on and the person who holds the string must stand within door or window or under some cover so that the silk ribbon may not be wet and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame of the door or window soon any of the thunder come over the kite the pointed wire will draw the electric Ô¨Åre from them and the kite with all the twine will be electriÔ¨Åed and the loose Ô¨Ålaments of the twine will stand out every way and be attracted by an approaching Ô¨Ånger and when the

proceeded follows friends said he the taxes are indeed very heavy and if those laid on by the government were the only ones we had to pay we might more easily dischar ge them but we have many others and much more grievous to some of us we are taxed twice much by our idleness three times much by our pride and four times much by our folly and from these taxes the commissioners can not ease or deliver us by allowing an abatement however let us harken to good advice and something may be done us helps them that help themselves poor richard says it would be thought hard governm ent that should tax its people part of their time to be employed in its service but idleness taxes many of us much more sloth by bringing on diseases absolutely shortens life like rust consumes faster than labor wears while the used key is always bright poor richard says dost thou love life then not squander time that is the stuff life is made of poor richard says how much more than is necessary we spend in sleep forgetting that sleeping fox catches poultry and that will be sleeping enough in the grave poor richard says time be of all things the most precious wasting time must be poor richard says greatest prodigality since he elsewhere tells us time is never found again and what we call time enough always proves little enough let us then up and be doing and doing to the purpose so by diligence shall we more with less perplexity makes all things difÔ¨Åcult but industry all easy and that riseth late must trot all day and shall scarce overtake his business at night while travels so slowly that poverty soon overtakes him drive thy business let not that drive thee and to bed and early to rise makes man healthy wealthy and wise poor richard says methinks i hear some of you say man afford himself leisure i will tell thee my friend what poor richard says thy time well if thou meanest to gain leisure and since thou art not sure of minute throw not away an hour leisure is time doing something useful this leisure the diligent man will obtain but the lazy man never life of leisure and life of laziness are two things many without labor would live by their wits only but they break

would be the choice of men of sense yours is to be Ô¨Åxt down to chess where you are found engaged two or three hours this is your perpetual recreation which is the least eligible of any sedentary man

occasionally bring you relief by agitating those humors and so purifying or dissipating them if it was in some nook or alley in paris deprived of walks that you played awhile at chess after dinner

position which is neither controverted nor doub ted to which the understandings and feelings of all classes of men assent and which in substance is admitted by the opponents well by the friends of the new constitution it must in truth be acknowledged that however these may differ in other respects they in general appear to harmonize in the opinion that there are material imperfections in our national system and that something is necessary to be done to rescue us from impending anarchy the facts that support this opinion are longer objects of speculation they have forced themselves upon the sensibility of the people at large and have at length extort ed from those whose mistaken policy has had the principal share in precipitating the extremity at which we are arrived reluctant

land symptom of national distress the price of improved land in most parts of the country is much lower than can be accounted by the quantity of waste land at market and can only be fully explained by that want of private and public conÔ¨Ådence which are so alarmingly prevalent among all ranks and which have direct tendency to depreciate property of every kind is private credit the friend and patron of industry that most useful kind which relates to borrowing and lending is reduced within the narrowest limits and this still more from an opinion of insecurity than from scarcity of money to

federal measures is destroyed by strenuous opposition to remedy upon the only principles that can give it chance of success while they admit that the government of the united states is destitute of

but from fundamental errors in the structure of the building which can not be amended otherwise than by an alteration in the very elements and main pillars of the fabric the great and radical vice in the construction of the existing confederation is in the principle of legislation states or governments in their corporate or collective capacities and from the individuals of whom they consist tho this principle does not run through all the powers delegated to the union yet it pervades and governs those on which the efÔ¨Åcacy of the rest depends except to the rule of apportionment the united states have an indeÔ¨Ånite discretion to make requis itions men and money but they have autho rity to raise either by regulations extending to the individual citizens of america the consequence of this is that tho in theory their resolutions concerning those objects are laws constitutionally binding on the members of 126 127 128 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics

could be removed by evidence of their being erroneous of explanation or apology the disavowal required of by burr in general and indeÔ¨Ånite form was out of my power if it had really been proper to

applying only to white men dome stic labor was conÔ¨Åned to the blacks and such was the prejudice that if he who was the most popular man in his district were to keep white servant in his house his character and reputation would be irretrievably ruined i said that this confounding of the ideas of servitude and labor was one of the bad effects of slavery but he thought it attended with many excellent consequences it did not apply to all kinds of example to farming he himself had often held the plow so had his father manufacturing and mechanical labor was not degrading it was only manual proper work of slave white person could descend to that and it was the best guarantee to equality among the whites it produced an unvarying level among them it not only did not excite but did not even admit of inequalities by which one white man could domineer over another i told calhoun i could not see things in the same light it is in truth all perverted labor slavery and dominion freedom the discussion of the missouri question has betrayed the secret of their souls in the abstract they admit that slavery is an evil they disclaim all participation in the introduction of it and cast it all upon the shoulders of our old granddam britain but when probed to the quick upon it they show at the bottom of their souls pride and vainglory in their condition of masterdom they fancy themselves more generous and than the plain freemen who labor subsistence they look down upon the simplicity of yankee manners because he has habits of overbearing like theirs and can not treat negroes like dogs it is among the evils of slavery that it taints the very sources of moral principle it establishes false estimates of virtue and vice what can be more false and heartless than this doctrine which makes the Ô¨Årst and holiest rights of humanity to depend upon the color of the skin it perverts human reason and reduces man endowed with logical powers to maintain that slavery is sanctioned by the christian religion that slaves are happy and contented in their condition that between master and slave there are ties of mutual attachment and affection that the virtues of the master are reÔ¨Åned and exalted by the degradation of the slave while at the same time they vent execrations upon the trade curse britain having given them slaves burn at the stake negroes convicted of crimes the terror of the example and writhe in agonies of fear at the very mention of human rights applicable to men of color the impression produced upon my mind by the progress of this discussion is that the bargain between freedom and slavery contained in the constitution of the united states is morally and politically vicious inconsistent with the principles upon which alone our revolution can be justiÔ¨Åed cruel and oppressive by riveting the chains of slavery by pledging the faith of freedom to maintain and perpetuate the tyranny of the master and grossly unequal and impolitic by admitting that slaves are at once enemies to be kept in subjection property to be secured or restored to their owners and persons not to be represented themselves but whom their masters are privileged with nearly double share of representation the consequence has been that this slave representation has governed the union benjamin portioned above his brethren has ravened wolf in the morning he has devoured the prey and at night he has divided the spoil it would be difÔ¨Åcult matter to prove by reviewing the history of the union under this constitution that almost everything which has contributed to the honor and

espouses its own the interests of human nature scorns all meanness and deÔ¨Åes all peril hears in its own conscience voice louder than threatenings and thunders withstands all the powers of the

mankind of this moral greatness which throws all other forms of greatness into obscurity we see not trace in napoleon tho clothed with the power of god the thought of consecrating himself to the introduction of new and higher to the exaltation of the character and condition of his race seems never to have dawned on his mind the spirit of disinterestedness and seem s not to have waged moment

interes ts with too much heartiness to live an hour what napoleon always lived to make itself the theme and gaze and wonder of dazzled world next to moral comes intellectual greatness or genius in the highest sense of that word and by this we mean that sublime capacity of thought through which the soul smitten with the love of the true and the beautiful essays to comprehend the universe soars into

harmonies between the world within and the world without us and Ô¨Ånds in every region of the universe types and interpreters of its own deep mysteries and glorious inspirations this is the greatness which belongs to philosophers and to the master in poetry and the Ô¨Åne arts next comes the greatness of action and by this we mean the sublime power of conceiving bold and extensive plans of constructing and bringing to bear on mighty object complicated machinery of means energies and arrangements and of accomplishing great outward effects to this head belongs the greatness of bonaparte and that he possest it we need not prove and none will be hardy enough to deny man who raised himself from obscurity to throne who changed the face of the world who made himself felt through powerful and civilized nations who sent the terror of his name across seas and oceans whose will was pronounced and feared destiny whose donatives were crowns whose antechamber was thronged by submissive

the letter of introduction and my card on which i had written that i was on my way to the ruins of melrose abbey and wished to know whether it would be agreeable to scott he had not yet been made baronet to receive visit from in the course of the morning in little while the lord of the castle himself made his appearance i knew him at once by the descriptions i had read and heard and the likeness that had been published of him he was tall and of large and powerful frame his dress was simple and almost rustic an old green with at the buttonhole brown linen pantaloons stout shoes that tied at the ankles and white hat that had evidently seen service he came limping up the aiding himself by stout f but moving rapidly and with vigor by his side jogged along large of most grave

the scotch hills is warrant enough second breakfast i was accordingly whirled to the portal of the cottage and in few moments found myself seated at the scott proposed ramble to show something of the surrounding country we sallied forth every dog in the establishment turned out to attend us there was the old hound maida noble animal and great favorite of scott and hamlet the black greyhound wild thoughtless youngster not yet arrived to the years of discretion and finette beautiful setter with soft silken hair long pendent ears and mild eye the parlor favorite when in front of the house we were joined by superannuated greyhound who came from the kitchen wagging his tail and was cheered by scott an old friend and comrade in our walks scott would frequently pause in conversation to notice his dogs and speak to them if rational companions and indeed there appears to be vast deal of rationality in these faithful attendants on man derived from their close intim acy with him maida deported himself with gravity becoming his age and size and seemed to consider himself called upon to preserve great degree of dignity and decorum in our society he jogged along little distance ahead of us the young dogs woul d gambol about him leap on his neck worry at his ears and endeavor to tease him into frolic 162 163 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ix of 10 https old dog would keep on long time with imperturbable solemnity now and then seeming to rebuke the wantonness of his young companions we had not walked much further before we saw the two miss scotts advancing along the hillside to meet us the morning studies being over they had set off to take ramble on the hills and gather heather with which to decorate their hair dinner they came bounding lightly like young fawns and their dresses Ô¨Çuttering in the pure summer breeze i was reminded of scott own description of his childre n in his introduction to one of the cantos of marmion they approached the dogs all sprang forward and gamboled around them they played with them time and then joined us with countenances full of health and glee sophia 55 the eldest was the most lively and joyous having much of her father varied spirit in conversation and seeming to catch excitement from his words and looks ann was of quieter mood rather silent owing in some measure doubt to her being some years younger at the dinner scott had laid by his dress and appeared clad in black the girls too in completing their toilet had twisted in their hair the sprigs of purple heather which they had gathered on the hillside and looked all fresh and blooming from their breezy walk there was guest at dinner but myself around the table were two or three dogs in attendance maida the old took his seat at scott elbow looking up wistfully in his master eye while finette the pet spaniel placed herself near scott by whom i soon perceived she was completely spoiled among the other important and privileged members of the household who Ô¨Ågured in attendance at the dinner was large gray cat who i observed was regaled from time to time with titbits from the table this sage grimalkin was favorite of both master and mistress and slept at night in their room and scott laughingly observed that one of the least wise parts of their establishment was that the window was left open at night puss to go in and out the cat assumed kind of ascendency among the in state in scott armchair and occasionally stationing himself on chair beside the door if to review his subjects they passed giving each dog cuff beside the ears he went by this clapper was always taken in good part it appeared to be in fact mere act of sovereignty on the part of grimalkin to remind the others of their vassalage which they acknowledged by the most perfect acquiescence general harmony prevailed between sovereign and subjects and they would all sleep togeth er in the sunshine after dinner we adjourned to the which served also study and library against the wall on one side was long with drawers surmounted by small cabinet of polished wood with richly studded with brass ornaments within which scott kept his most valuable papers above the cabinet in kind of niche was complete corselet of glittering steel with closed helmet and Ô¨Çanked by gantlets and around were hung trophies and relics of various kinds simitar of tipu sahib high land broadsword from flodden Ô¨Åeld pair of rippon spurs from bannockburn and above all gun which had belonged to rob roy and bore his initials 56 an object of peculiar interest to at the time it was understood scott was actually engaged in printing novel founded on the story of that famous outlaw on each side of the cabinet were bookcases well stored with works of romantic Ô¨Åction in various languages many of them rare and antiquated this however was merely his cottage library the principal part of his books being at edinbur gh from this little cabinet of curiosities scott drew forth manuscript picked up on the Ô¨Åeld at waterloo containing copies of severa l songs popular at the time in france the paper was dabbled with the very very possibly said scott of some gay 164 165 166 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ix of 10 https ofÔ¨Åcer who had cherished these songs keepsake from some in the evening passed away delightfully in this apartment half study half scott had read several passages from the old romances of arthur with Ô¨Åne deep sonorous voice and gravity of tone that seemed to suit the antiquat ed letter volume it was rich treat to hear such work read by such person and in such place and his appearance he sat reading in large armed chair with his favorite hound maida at his feet and surrounded by books and relics and border trophi es would have formed an admirable and most characteristic picture while scott was reading the sage grimalkin already mentioned had taken his seat in chair beside the Ô¨Åre and remained with Ô¨Åxt eye and grave demeanor if listening to the reader i observed to scott that his cat seemed to have taste in literature ah said he these cats are very mysterious kind of folk there is always more passing in their minds than we are aware of it comes doubt from their being so familiar with witches and when i retired the night i found it almost impossible to sleep the idea of being under the roof of scott of being on the borders of the tweed in the very center of that region which had some time past been the favorite scene of romantic Ô¨Åction and above all the recollections of the ramble i had taken the company in which i had taken it and the conversation which had passed all fermented in my mind and nearly drove sleep from my pillow on the following morning the sun darted his beams from over the hills throug h the low lattice window i rose at an early hour and looked out between the branches of eglantine which overhung the casement to my surprize scott was already up and forth seated on fragment of stone and chatting with the workmen employed on the new building 57 i had supposed after the time he had wasted upon yesterday he would be closely occupied this morning but he appeared like man of leisure who had nothing to but bask in the sunshine and amuse himself i soon drest myself and joined him he talked about his proposed plans of abbotsford happy would it have been him could he have contented himself with his delightful little cottage and the simple yet hearty and hospitable style in which he lived at the time of my visit the great pile of abbotsford with the huge expense it entailed upon him of servants retainers guests and baronial style was drain upon his purse tax upon his exertions and weight upon his mind and Ô¨Ånally crusht him after breakfast scott was occupied some time correcting whic h he had received by the mail the novel of rob roy 58 i have already observed was at that time in the press and i supposed them to be the of that work the authorship of the waverley novels was still matte r of conjecture and uncertainty tho few doubted their being principally written by scott one proof to of his being the author was that he never adverted to them man so fond of anything scottish and anything relating to national history or local legend could not have been mute respecting such productions had they been written by another he was fond of quoting the works of his contemporaries he was continually reciting scraps of border songs or relating anecdotes of border story with respect to his own poems and their merits however he was mute and while with him i observed scrupulous silence on the subject footnotes from the collection of papers entitled crayon miscellany irving visit was made in

large clouds whose color seemed brightened by the light reÔ¨Çected from the mass of snow that covered the earth Ô¨Çoated in sky of the purest blue the road wound along the brow of precipice and on one side was upheld by foundation of logs piled one upon the other while narrow excavation in the mountain in the opposite direction had made passage of sufÔ¨Åcient width the ordinary traveling of that day but logs excavation and everything that did not reach several feet above the earth lay alike buried beneath the snow single track barely wide enough to receive the sleigh denoted the route of the highway and this was sunk nearly two feet below the surrounding surface in the vale which lay at distance of several hundred feet lower there was what in the language of the country was called clearing and all the usual improvements of new settlement these even extended up the hill to the point where the road turned short and ran across the level land which lay on the summit of the mountain but the summit itself remained in the forest there was glittering in the atmosphere if it was Ô¨Ålled with innumerable shining particles and the noble bay horses that drew the sleigh were covered in many parts with coat of the vapor from their nostrils was seen to issue like smoke and every object in the view well every arrangement of the travelers denoted the depth of winter in the mountains the harness which was of deep dull black differing from the glossy varnishing of the present day was ornamented with enorm ous plates and buckles of brass that shone like gold in those transient beams of the sun which found their way obliquely throug h the tops of the trees huge saddles studded with nails and Ô¨Åtted with cloth that served blankets to the shoulders of the cattle supported four high turrets through which the stout reins led from the mouths of the horses to the hands of the driver who was negro of apparently twenty years of age his face which nature had colored with glistening black was now mottled with the cold and his large shining eyes Ô¨Ålled with tears tribute to its power that the keen frosts of those regions always extracted from one of his african origin still there

southern extremity of this beautiful Ô¨Çat and immediately under the feet of our travelers alone showed by its rippling surface and the vapors which exhaled from it that what at Ô¨Årst might seem plain was one of the mountain lakes locked in the frosts of winter narrow current rushed impetuously from its bosom at the open place we mention ed and was to be traced miles it wound its way toward the south through the real valley by its borders of hemlock and pine and by the vapor which arose from its warmer surface into the chill atmosphere of the hills the banks of this lovely basin at its outlet 61 or southern end were steep but not high and in that direction the land continued far the eye could reach narrow but graceful valley along which the settlers had scattered their humble habitations with profusion that bespoke the quality of the soil and the comparative facilities of intercourse immediately on the bank of the lake and at its foot stood the village of templeton 62 it consisted of some Ô¨Åfty buildings including those of every description chieÔ¨Çy built of wood and which in their architecture bore great marks of taste but which also by the unÔ¨Ånished appearance of most of the dwellings indicated the hasty manne r of their construction to the eye they presented variety of colors few were white in both front and rear but more bore that expensive color on their fronts only while their economical but ambitious owners had covered the remaining sides of the ediÔ¨Åces with dingy red one or two were slowly assuming the russet of age while the uncovered beams that were to be seen through the broken windows on their second stories showed that either the taste or the vanity of their proprietors had led them to undertake task which they were unable to accomplish

directions of one who looked to the wants of posterity rather than to the convenience of the present incumb ents some three or four of the better sort of buildings in addition to the uniformity of their color were Ô¨Åtted with green blinds which at that season at least were rather strangely contrasted to the chill aspect of the lake the mountains the forests and the wide Ô¨Åelds of snow before the doors of these pretentious dwellings were placed few saplings either without branches or possessing only the feeble shoots of one or two summers growth that looked not unlike tall grenadiers on post near the threshold of princes in truth the occupants of these favored habitations were the nobles of templeton marmaduke was its king they were the dwellings of two young men who were cunning in the law an equal number of that class who chaffered to the wants of the community under the title of storekeepers and disciple of √¶sculapius who novelty brought more subjects into the world than he sent out of it in the midst of this incongruous group of dwellings rose the mansion of the judge towering above all its neighbors it stood in the center of an enclosure of several acres which was covered with some of the latter had been left by the indians and began already to assume the moss and inclination of age therein forming very marked contrast to the infant plantations that peered over most of the picketed fences of the village in addition to this show of cultivation were two rows of young lombardy poplars tree but lately introduced into america formally lining either side of pathway which led from gate that opened on the principal street to the front door of the building the house itself had been built entirely under the superintendence of certain richard jones whom we have already mentioned and who from his cleverness in small matters and an entire willingness to exert his talents added to the circumstances of their being sisters children ordinarily superintended all the minor concerns of marmaduke temple richard was fond of saying that this child of invention consisted of nothing more or less than what should form the groundwork of every clergyman discourse Ô¨Årstly and lastly he had commenced his labors in the Ô¨Årst year of their residence by erecting tall gaunt ediÔ¨Åce of wood with its gable toward the highway in this shelter it was little more the family resided three years by the end of that period richard had completed his design he had availed himself in this heavy undertakin g of the experience of certain wandering eastern mechanic who by exhibiting few soiled plates of english architecture and talking learnedly of friezes entablatures and particularly of the composite order had obtained very undue inÔ¨Çuence over richard taste in everything that pertained to that branch of the Ô¨Åne arts not that jones did not affect to consider hiram doolittle perfect empiric in his profession being in the constant habit of listening to his treatises on architecture with kind of indulgent smile yet either from an inability to oppose them by anything plausible from his own stores of learning or from secret admiration richard generally submitted to the argume nts of his coadjutor together they had not only directed dwelling marmaduke but they had given fashion to the architecture of the whole country the composite order doolittle would contend was an order composed of many others and was intended to be the most useful of all it admitted into its construction such alterations convenience or circumstances might require to this proposition richard usually assented and when rival geniuses who monopolize not only all the reputation but most of the money of the neighborhood are of mind it is not uncommon to see them lead the fashion even in graver matters in the present instance we have already hinted the castle judge temple dwelling was termed in common parlance came to be the model in some one or other of its numerous

its solution by the scene that followed there yet lingered sufÔ¨Åcient light in the heavens to exhibit those bright openings among the where different paths left the clearing to enter the depths of the wilderness beneath one of them line of warriors issued from the woods and advanced slowly toward the dwellings one in front bore short pole on which it afterward appeared were suspended several human scalps the startling sounds that duncan had heard were what the whites have not inappropriately called the hallo and each repetition of the cry was intended to announce to the tribe the fate of an enemy thus far the knowledge of heyward assisted him in the explanation and he knew that the interruption was caused by the return of successful party every disagreeable sensation was quieted in inward congratulations the opportune relief and insigniÔ¨Åcance it conferred on himself when at the distance of few hundred feet from the lodges the newly arrived warriors halted the plaintive and terriÔ¨Åc cry which was intended to represent equally the wailings of the dead and the triumph of the victors had entirely ceased one of their number now called aloud in words that were far from appalling tho not more intelligible to those whose ears they were intended than their expressive yells it would be difÔ¨Åcult to convey suitable idea of the savage ecstasy with which the news thus imparted was received the whole encampment in moment became scene of the most violent bustle and commotion the warriors drew their knives and Ô¨Çourishing them they arranged themselves in two lines forming lane that extended from the to the lodges the squaws seized clubs axes or whatever weapons of offense Ô¨Årst offered itself to their hands and rushed eagerly to act their part in the cruel game that was at hand even the children would not be excluded but boys little able to wield the instruments tore the 59 60 61 62 63 178 179 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world

clearing and wary and aged squaw was occupied Ô¨Åring many might serve to light the coming exhibition the Ô¨Çame arose its power exceeded that of the parting day and assisted to render objects at the same time more distinct and more hideous the whole scene formed striking picture whose frame was composed of the dark and tall border of pines the warriors just arrived were the most distant Ô¨Ågures little in advance stood two men who were apparently selected from the rest the principal actors in what was to follow the light was not strong enough to render their features distinct tho it was quite evident that they were governed by very different emotions while one stood erect and Ô¨Årm prepared to meet his fate like hero the other bowed his head if palsied by terror or stricken with shame the duncan felt powerful impulse of admiration and pity toward the former tho opportunity could offer to exhibit his generous emotions he watched his slightest movement however with eager eyes and he traced the Ô¨Åne outline of his admirably proportioned and active frame he endeavored to persuade himself that if the powers of man seconded by such noble resolution could bear one harmless through so severe trial the youthful captive before him might hope success in the hazardous race he was about to run insensibly the young man drew nigher to the swarthy lines of the hurons and scarcely breathed so intense became his interest in the spectacle just then the signal yell was given and the momentary quiet which had preceded it was broken by burst of cries that far exceeded any before heard the most abject of the two victims continued motionless but the other bounded from the place at the cry with the activity and the swiftness of deer instead of rushing through the hostile lines had been expected he just entered the dangerous deÔ¨Åle and before time was given single blow turned short and leaping the heads of row of children he gained at once the exterior and safer side of the formidable array the artiÔ¨Åce was answered by hundred voices raised in imprecations and the whole of the excited multitude broke from their order and spread themselves about the place in wild confusion dozen blazing piles now shed their lurid brightness on the place which resembled some unhallowed and supernatural arena in which malicious demons had assembled to act their bloody and lawless rites the forms in the background looked like unearthly beings gliding before the eye and cleaving the air with frantic and unmeaning gestures while the savage passions of such passed the Ô¨Çames were rendered fearfully distinct by the gleams that shot athwart their inÔ¨Çamed visages it will easily be understood that amid such concourse of vindictive enemies was allowed the fugitive there was single moment when it seemed if he would have reached the forest but the whole body of his captors threw themselves before him and drove him back into the center of his relentless persecutors turning like headed deer he shot with the swiftness of an arrow through pillar of forked Ô¨Çame and passing the whole multitude harmless he appeared on the opposite side of the clearing here too he was met and turned by few of the older and more subtle of the hurons once more he tried the throng if seeking safety in its blindness and then several moments succeeded during which duncan believed the active and courageous young stranger was lost nothing could be distinguished but dark mass of human forms tossed and involved in inexplicable confusion arms gleaming knives and formidable clubs appeared above them but the blows were evidently given at random the awful effect was heightened by the piercing shrieks of the women and the Ô¨Åerce yells of the warriors now and then duncan caught glimpse of light form cleaving the air in some desperate bound and he rather hoped than believed that the captive yet retained the command of his astonishing powers of activity suddenly the multi tude rolled backward and approached the spot where he himself stood the heavy body in the rear prest upon the women and children in 180 181 182 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ix of 10 https and bore them to the earth the stranger reappeared in the confusion human power could not however much longer endure so severe trial there was term of abuse known to the huron vocabulary that the disappointed women did not lavishly expend on the successful stranger they Ô¨Çouted at his efforts and told him with bitter scoffs that his feet were better than his hands and that he merited wings while he knew not the use of an arrow or knife to all this the captive made reply but was content to preserve an attitude in which dignity was singularly blended with disdain exasperated much by his composure by his good fortune their words became unintelligible and were succeeded by shrill piercing yells just then the crafty squaw who had taken the necessary precautions to Ô¨Åre the piles made her way through the throng and cleared place herself in front of the captive the squalid and withered person of this hag might well have obtained her the character of possessing more than human cunning throwing back her light vestment she stretched forth her long skinny arm in derision and using the language of the lenape more intelligible to the subject of her gibes she commenced aloud look you delaware she said snapping her Ô¨Ångers in his face your nation is race of women and the hoe is better Ô¨Åtted to your hands than the gun your squaws are the mothers of deer but if bear or wild cat or serpent were born among you ye would Ô¨Çee the huron girls shall make you petticoats and we will Ô¨Ånd you husband burst of savage laughter succeeded this attack during which the soft and musical merriment of the younger females strang ely chimed with the cracked voice of their older and more malignant companion but the stranger was superior to all their efforts his head was immovable nor did he betray the slightest consciousness that any were present except when his haughty eyes rolled toward the dusky forms of the warriors who stalked in the background silent and sullen observers of the scene infuriated at the of the captive the woman placed her arms akimbo and throwing herself into posture of deÔ¨Åance she broke out anew in torrent of words that art of ours could commit successfully to paper her breath was however expended in vain altho distinguished in her nation proÔ¨Åcient in the art of abuse she was permitted to work herself into such fury actually to foam at the mouth without causing muscle to vibrate in the motionless Ô¨Ågure of the stranger the effect of his indifference began to extend itself to the other spectators and youngster who was just quitting the condition of boy to enter the state of manhood attempted to assist the termagant by Ô¨Çourishing his tomahawk before their victim and adding his empty boasts to the taunts of the woman then indeed the captive turned his face toward the light and looked down on the stripling with an expression that was superior to contempt at the next moment he resumed his quiet and reclining attitude against the post but the change of posture had permitted duncan to exchange glances with the Ô¨Årm and piercing eyes of uncas breathless with amazement and heavily opprest with the critical situation of his friend heyward recoiled before the look trembling lest its meaning might in some unknown manner hasten the prisoner fate there was not however any instant cause such an apprehension just then warrior forced his way into the exasperated crowd motioning the women and children aside with stern gesture he took uncas by the arm and led him toward the door of the council lodge thither all the chiefs and most of the distinguished warriors followed among whom the anxious heyward found means to enter without attracting any dangerous attention to himself few

by the sound of busy workmen employed in constructing scaffold the scene of execution on the following day on the afternoon of the fourth the duke of alva 68 had sent martin rithovius bishop of ypres and communicating to him the sentence of the nobles he requested the prelate to visit the prisoners acquaint them with their fate and prepare them their execution on the following day the bishop an excellent man and the personal friend of egmont was astounded by the tidings he threw himself at alva feet imploring mercy the prisoners and if he could not spare their lives beseeching him at least to grant them more time preparation but alva sternly rebuked the prelate saying that he had been summoned not to thwart the execution of the law but to console the prisoners and enable them to die

vain hope that it was to inform them of the conclusion of their trial and their acquittal however this may be egmont seems to have been but ill prepared the dreadful tidings he received he turned deadly pale he listened to the bishop and exclaimed with deep emotion it is terrible sentence little did i imagine that any offense i had committed against god or the king could merit such punishment it is not death that i fear death is the common lot of all but i shrink from dishonor yet i may hope that my sufferings will so far expiate my offenses that my innocent family will not be involved in my ruin by the conÔ¨Åscation of my property this much at least i think i may claim in consideration of my past services then after pause he added since my death is the will of god and his majesty i will try to meet it with patience he asked the bishop if there were hope on being answered none whatever he resolved to devote himself at once to preparing the solemn change he rose from his couch and hastily drest himself he then made his confession to the prelate and desired that mass might be said and the sacrament administered to him this was done with great solemnity and egmont received the communion in the most devout manner manifesting the greatest contrition his sins he next inquired of the bishop to what prayer he could best have recourse to sustain him in this trying hour the prelate recommended to him that prayer which our savior had commended to his disciples the advice pleased the count who earnestly engaged in his devotions but host of tender recollections crowded on his mind and the images of his wife and children drew his thoughts in another direction till the kind expostulations of the prelate again restored him to himself egmont asked whether it would be well to say anything on the scaffold the ediÔ¨Åcation of the people but the bishop discouraged him saying that he would be imperfectly heard and that the people in their present excitement would be apt to misinter pret what he said to their own prejudice having attended to his spiritual concern s egmont called writing materials and wrote letter to his wife whom he had not seen during his long conÔ¨Ånement and to her he now bade tender farewell he then addrest another letter written in french in few brief and touching sentences to the fortunately has been preserved to us this 200 201 202

these troubles i have counseled or permitted aught which might seem otherwise i have done so from sincere regard the service of god and your majesty and from what i believed the necessity of the times

it might soften the heart of the king by reminding him of happier days when he had looked with an eye of favor on his unhappy vassal having completed all his arrangements egmont became impatient the hour of his departure and he exprest the hope that there would be unnecessary delay at ten in the morning the soldiers appeared who were to conduct him to the scaffold they brought with them cords usual to bind the prisoner hands but egmont remonstrated and showed that he had himself cut off the collar of his doublet and shirt in order to facilitate the stroke of the executioner this he did to convince them that he meditated resistance and on his promising that he would attempt none they consented to his remaining with his hands unbound egmont was drest in crimson damask robe over which was

saw it and few even of the spaniards could refrain from tears they took their last look at the gallant noble who was to perish so miserably with steady step he mounted the scaffold and he crossed it gave utterance to the vain wish that instead of meeting such fate he had been allowed to die in the service of his king and country he quickly however turned to other thoughts and kneeling on one of the cushions with the bishop beside him on the other he was soon engaged earnestly in prayer with his eyes raised toward heaven with look of unutterable sadness he prayed so fervently and loud to be distinctly heard by the spectators the prelate much affected put into his hands the silver cruciÔ¨Åx which egmont repeatedly kissed after which having received absolution the last time he rose and made sign to the bishop to retire he then stript off his mantle and robe and again kneeling he drew silk cap which he had brought the purpose over his eyes and repeating the words into thy hands lord i commend my spirit he calmly awaited the stroke of the executioner the low sounds of lamentation which from time to time had been heard among the populace were now hushed into silence the minister of justice appearing on the platform approached his victim and with single blow of the sword severed the head from the body cry of horror rose from the multitude and some frantic with grief broke through the ranks of the soldiers and wildly dipped their handkerchiefs in the blood that streamed from the scaffold treasu ring them up says the chronicler precious memorials of love and incitements to

forth the remaining prisoner to execution it had been assigned to the curate of la chapelle to acquaint count hoorne with his fate that nobleman received the awful tidings with less patience than was shown by his friend he gave way to burst of indignation at the cruelty and injustice of the sentence it was poor requital he said years of faithful service to his sovereign yet he added he was not sorry to be released from life of such incessant fatigue some time he refused to confess saying he had done enough in the way of confession when urged not to throw away the few precious moments that were left to him he at length consented the count was drest in plain suit of black and wore milanese cap upon his head he was at this time about Ô¨Åfty years of age he was tall with handsome features and altogether of commanding presence his form was erect and he passed with steady step through the Ô¨Åles of soldiers on his way to the place of execution he frankly saluted those of his acquaintance whom he saw among the spectators his look had in it less of sorrow than of indignation like that of one conscious of enduring wrong he was spared one pang in his last hour which had Ô¨Ålled egmont cup with bitterness tho like him he had wife he was to leave orphan family to mourn him he trod the scaffold the apparatus of death seemed to have power to move him he still repeated the declaration that often he had offended his maker he had never to his knowledge committed any offense against the king when his eyes fell on the bloody shroud that enveloped the remai ns of egmont he inquired if it were the body of his friend being answered in the afÔ¨Årmative he made some remark in castilian not understood he then prayed few moments but in so low tone that the words were not caught by the bystanders and rising he asked pardon of those around if he had ever offended any of them and earnestly besought their prayers then without further delay he knelt down and repeating the words in manus

to keep alive the popular excitement the bodies were not allowed to remain long in their temporary places of deposit but were transported to the family residences of the two lords in the country and

could never of course have had any real existence but the sentiments which are described animating that age have been found more or less operative in different countries and different periods of society in spain especially this inÔ¨Çuence is to be discerned from very early date its inhabitants may be said to have lived in romantic atmosp here in which all the extravagances of chivalry were nourished by their peculiar situation their hostile relations with the moslem kept alive the full glow of religious and patriotic feeling their history is one interminable crusade an enemy always on the borders invited perpetual displays of personal daring and adventure the reÔ¨Ånement and magniÔ¨Åcence of the spanish arabs throw luster over 208 67 68 209 the project gutenberg ebook of the best

courtesy were blended in the martial bosom of the spaniard and spain became emphatically the land of romantic chivalry the very laws themselves conceived in this spirit contributed greatly to foster it the ancient code of alfonso x in the thirteenth century after many minute regulations the deportment of the good knight enjoins on him to invoke the name of his mistress in the Ô¨Åght that it may infuse new ardor into his soul and preserve him from the commission of unknightly actions such laws were not dead letter the history of spain shows that the sentiment of romantic gallantry penetrated the nation more deeply and continued longer than in any other quarter of christendom the taste these romantic extravagan ces naturally fostered corresponding taste the perusal of tales of chivalry indeed they acted reciprocally on each other these chimerical legends had once also beguiled the long evenings of our norman ancestors but in the progress of civilization had gradually given way to other and more natural forms of composition they still maintained their ground in italy whither they had passed later and where they were consecrated by the hand of genius but italy was not the true soil of chivalry and the inimitable Ô¨Åctions of bojardo pulci and ariosto were composed with that lurking smile of mirth which far from serious tone could raise only corresponding smile of incredulity in the reader in spain however the marvels of romance were all taken in perfect good faith not that they were received literally true but the reader surrendered himself up to the illusion and was moved to admiration by the recital of deeds which viewed in any other light than wild frolic of imagination would be supremely ridiculous these tales had not the merit of seductive style and melodious versiÔ¨Åcation to relieve them they were the most part an mass of incongruities in which there was little keeping and probability in the characters in the incidents while the whole was told

brought forward personage in whom were embodied all those generous virtues which belong to chivalry disinterestedness contempt of danger unblemished honor knightly courtesy and those aspirations after ideal excellence which if empty dreams are the dreams of magnanimous spirit they are indeed represented by cervantes too ethereal this world and are successively dispelled they come in contact with the coarse realities of life it is this view of the subject which has led sismondi among other critics to consider that the principal end of the author was the ridicule of contrast of the heroic with the vulgar he sees something profoundly sad in the conclusions to which it leads this sort of criticism appears to be it resembles the efforts of some commentators to allegorize the great epics of homer and virgil throwing disagreeable mistiness over the story by converting mere shadows into substances and substances into shadows the great purpose of cervantes was doubtless that expressly avowed by himself namely to correct the popular taste romances of chivalry it is unnecessary to look any other in so plain tale altho it is true the conduct of the story produces impressions on the reader to certain extent like those suggested by sismondi the melancholy tendency however is in great degree counteracted by the exquisitely ludicrous character of the incidents perhaps after all if we are to hunt moral the key of the Ô¨Åction we may with more reason pronounce it to be the necessity of proportioning our undertakings to our capacities the mind of the hero don quixote is an ideal

into foreign tongue don quixote insanity operates both in mistaking the ideal the real and the real the ideal whatever he has found in romances he believes to exist in the world and he converts all he meets with in the world into the visions of his romances it is difÔ¨Åcult to say which of the two produces the most ludicrous results the better exposure of these mad fancies cervantes has not only put them into action in real life but contrasted them with another character which may be said to form the reverse side of his hero honest sancho represents the material principle perfectly his master does the intellectual or ideal he is of the earth earthy sly selÔ¨Åsh sensual his dreams are not of glory but of good feeding his only concern is his carcass his notions of honor appear to be much the

exquisitely opposed to the true spirit of chivalry the whole compass of Ô¨Åction nowhere displays the power of contrast so forcibly in these two characters perfectly opposed to each other not only in their minds and general habits but in the minutest details of personal appearance it was great effort of art cervantes to maintain the dignity of his hero character in the midst of the whimsical and

author art is less shown in regard to the other principal Ô¨Ågure in the piece sancho panza who with the most contemptible qualities contrives to keep strong hold on our interest by the kindness of

their wars and their intrigues not present the only aspect nor perhaps the most interesting under which human nature can be studied it is man in his domestic relations around his own Ô¨Åreside where
