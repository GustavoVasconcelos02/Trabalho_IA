studied at the university there his ﬁrst book appeared in 1898 since which year he has gradually gained an assured position one of the best critics and essayists in russia list of his works is follows shakespeare and his critic brandes good in the teaching of dostoevsky and nietzsche philosophy and preaching dostoevsky and nietzsche the philosophy of tragedy the apotheosis of groundlessness here translated under the title all things are possible beginnings and ends great vigils foreword in his paragraph on the russian spirit shestov gives us the real clue to russian literatur european cultur is rootle ss thing in the russians with us it is our very blood and bones the very nerve and root of our psyche we think in certain fashion we feel in certain fashion because our whole substance is of this fashion our speech and feeling ar organically inevitable to us with the russians it is differ ent they have only been inoculated with the virus of european cultur and ethic the virus works in them like disease and the inﬂammation and irritation comes forth literatur the bubbling and ﬁzzing is almost chemical not organic it is an organism seething it accepts and masters the strange virus what the russian is struggling with crying out against is not life itself it is only europea n cultur which has been introduced into his psyche and which hurts him the tragedy is not so much real soul tragedy surgical one russian art russian literatur after all does not stand on the same footing european or greek or egyptian art it is not spontaneous utterance it is not the ﬂowering of race it is surgical outcry horrifying or marvellous lacerating at ﬁrst but when we get used to it not really so profound not really ultimate little extraneous what is valuable is the evidence against european cultur implied in the novelists here at last expressed since peter the great russia has been accepting europe and seething europe down in curious process of katabolism russia has been expressing nothing inher ently russian russia modern christianity even was not russian her genuine christianity byzantine and asiatic is incompr ehensible to us so with her true philosophy what she has actually uttered is her own unwilling fantastic reproduction of european truths what she has really to utter the coming centuries will hear russia will certainly inherit the futur what we already call the greatness of russia is only her struggling it seems if she had at last absorbed and overcome the virus of old europe soon her new healthy body will begin to act in its own reality imitative more protesting more crying more but full and sound and lusty in itself real russia is born she the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https at us befor long meanwhile she goes through the last stages of reaction against us kicking away fr om the old womb of eur ope in shestov one of the last kicks is given true he seems to be only reactionary and destructive but he can ﬁnd little amusement at last in tweaking the european nose so he is fairly free european idealism is anathema but more than this it is little comical we feel the new independence in his new indiffer ence he is only tweaking the nose of european idealism he is preaching nothing so he protests time and again he absolutely refutes any imputation of central idea he is so afraid lest it should turn out to be another hateful of an ideal everything is possible is his really central cry it is not nihilism it is only shaking free of the human psyche from old bonds the positive central idea is that the human psyche or soul r eally believes in itself and in nothing else dress this up in little comely language and we have real new ideal that will last us new long epoch the human soul itself is the source and of creative activity in the unconscious human soul the creative prompting issues ﬁrst into the universe open the consciousness to this prompting away with all your old locks dams channels ideal on earth is anything more than an obstruction in the end to the creative issue of the spontaneous soul away with all ideals let each individual act spontaneously from the prompting of the creative within him there is universal law each being is at his purest law unto himself single unique godhead fountain fr om the unknown this is the ideal which shestov refuses positively to state because he is afraid it may prove in the end trap to catch his own free spirit so it may but it is none the less real living ideal the moment the very salvation when it becomes ancient and like the old lion who lay in his cave and whined devours all its servants then it can be despatched meanwhile it is r eally liberating wor shestov style is puzzling at ﬁrst having found the ands and buts and becauses and ther efores hamper ed him he clips them all off deliberately and even spitefully so that his thought is like man with buttons on his clothes ludicr ously hitch ing along all undone one must be amused not irritated wher the armholes were bit tight shestov cuts slit it is bafﬂing but really rather piquant the real conjunction the real uniﬁcation lies in the r eader own amusement not in the author unbr oken logic law rence par t i zu fragmentarisch ist w elt und leben heine 1 the obscure streets of life not offer the conveniences of the central thorough fares electric light gas

that way what can wretched pedestrian gather under such circumstances how can we expect clear account from him whose curiosity let us suppose his curiosity so strong led him to grope his the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https the outskirts of life why should we try to compare his records with those of the travellers through brilliant streets 2 the law of sequence in natural phenomena seems so plausible so obvious that one is tempted to look its origin not in the realities of actual life but in the promptings of the human mind this law of sequence is the most mysterious of all the natural laws why so much order why not chaos and disorderliness really if the hypothesis of sequence had not offered such blatant advantages to the human intelligence man would never have thought of raising it to the rank of eternal and irrefutable truth but he saw his opportunity thanks to the grand hypothesis man is forewarned and forearmed thanks to this master the future is at his mercy he knows in order that he may foreknow savoir pour prévoir here is man by virtue of one supreme assumption dictator henceforward of all nature the philosophers have ever bowed the knee to success so down they went before the law of natural sequence they hailed it with the title of eternal truth but even this seemed insufﬁcient vient en mangeant like the old woman in the about the golden ﬁsh they had it in their minds that the ﬁsh should their errands but some few people at last could not stand this impudence some very few began to object 3 the comfortable settled man says to himself how could one live without being sure of the morrow how could one sleep without roof over one head but misfort une turns him out of house and home he must perforce sleep under hedge he can not rest he is full of terrors there may be wild beasts but in the long run he gets used to it he will trust himself to chance live like tramp and sleep his sleep in ditch 4 writer particularly young and inexperienced writer feels himself under an obligation to give his reader the fullest answers to all possible questions conscience will not let him shut his eyes to tormenting problems and so he begins to speak of ﬁrst and ultimate things he can not say anything proﬁtable on such it is not the business of the young to be profoundly grows excited he shouts himself to hoarseness in the end he is silent from exhaustion and then if his words have had any success with the public he is astonished to ﬁnd that he has become prophet whereupon if he be an average sort of person he is ﬁlled with an insatiable desire to preserve his inﬂuence till the end of his days but if he be more sensitive or gifted than usual he begins to despise the crowd its vulgar credulity and himself having posed in the stupid and disgraceful character of clown of lofty ideas 5 how painful it is to read plato account of the last conversations of socrates the days even the hours of the old man are numbered and yet he talks talks talks crito comes to him in the early morning and tells him that the sacred ships will shortly return to athens and at once socrates is ready to talk to argue it is possible of course that plato is not altogether to be trusted it is said that socrates observed of the dialogues already written down by plato how much that youth has belied but then from all sources we have it that socrates spent the month following his verdict in incessant conversations with his pupils and friend that is what it is to be beloved master and to have disciples you ca even die quietly the best death is really the one which is considered the worst to die alone in foreign land in or they say like dog under hedge then at least one may spend one last moments honestly without dissembling or ostentation preparing oneself the dreadful or wonderful the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https his sister tells us also talked great deal before his death and musset cried like baby perhaps socrates and pascal talked so much fear they should start crying it is false shame 6 the fact that some ideas or some series of ideas are materially unproﬁtable to mankind can not serve justiﬁcation their rejection once an idea is there the gates must be opened to it if you close the gates the thought will force way in or like the ﬂy in the fable will sneak through unawares ideas have regard our laws of honour or morality take example realism in literature at its appearance it aroused universal indignation why need we know the dirt of life and honestly there is need realism could give straightforward justiﬁcation itself but it had to come through it was ready with lie it compared itself to pathology called itself useful beneﬁcial and so obtained place we can all see now that realism is not beneﬁcial but harmful very harmful and that it has nothing in comm on with pathology nevertheless it is longer easy to drive it from its place the prohibition evaded there is now the justus titulus possessions 7 count tolstoy preached inaction it seems he had need we inact remarkably idleness just that idleness tolstoy dreamed of free conscious idling that despises labour this is one of the chief characteri stics of our time of course i speak of the higher cultured classes the aristocracy of w write books paint pictures compose symphonies is that labour it is only the amusement of idleness so that tolstoy is much more to the point when forgetting his preaching of inaction he bids us trudge eight hours day at the tail of the plough in this there is some sense idleness spoils us we were returning to the most primitive of all the states of our forefathers like paradisal adam and eve having need to sweat our bread we were trying to pilfer the fruit from the forbidden tree truly we received similar punishment divine laws are inscrutable in paradise everything is permitted except curiosity even labour is allowed though it is not obligatory it is outside tolstoy realised the dangers of the paradisal state he stooped to talk of inaction then he began to work since in regular smooth constant rhythmical labour whether it is efﬁcient or whether it merely appears efﬁcient like tolstoy farming there is peace of mind look at the industrious germans who begin and who end their day with prayer in paradise where there is labour and need long rest and heavy sleep all temptations become dangerous it is peril to live there perhaps people eschew the paradisal state they prefer work where there is work there is smoothness regularity peacefulness satisfaction in eden even the individuals can not tell what will come next savoir pour prévoir does not answer and everlasting laws are exposed to ridicule amongst ourselves also few of the the idlers are beginning to question our established knowledge but the majority of men and particularly germ ans still defend priori judgments on the ground that without these perfect knowledge would be impossible there could be regulatio n of the course of natural phenomena and looking ahead 8 to escape from the grasp of contemporary ruling ideas one should study history the lives of other men in other lands in other ages teach us to realise that our eternal laws and infallible ideas are just abortions take step further imagine manki nd living elsewhere than on this earth and all our terrestial eternalities lose their charm the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https know nothing of the ultimate realities of our existence nor shall we ever know anything let that be agreed but it does not follow that therefore we must accept some or other dogmatic theory modus vivendi not even positivism which has such sceptical face on it it only follows that man is free to change his conception of the universe often he changes his boots or his gloves and that constancy of principle belongs only to one relationships with other people in order that they may know where and to what extent they may depend on us therefore on principle man shoul d respect order in the external world and complete chaos in the inner and those who ﬁnd it difﬁcult to bear such duality some internal order might also be provided only they should not pride themselves on it but always remember that it is sign of their weakness pettiness dullness 10 the pythagoreans assumed that the sun is motionless and that the earth turns round what long time the truth had to wait recognition 11 in spite of epicurus and his exasperation we are forced to admit that anything whatsoever may result from anything whatsoever which does not mean however that stone ever turned into bread or that our visible universe was ever naturally formed from nebulous puffs but from our own minds and our own experience we can deduce nothing that would serve us ground setting even the smallest limit to nature own arbitrary behaviour if whatever happens now had chanced to happen quite differently it would not therefore have seemed any the less natural to us in other words although there may be an element of inevitability in our human judgments concerning the natural phenomena we have never been able and probably never shall be able to separate the grain of inevitable from the chaff of accidental and casual truth moreover we not even know which is more essential and important the inevitable or the casual hence we are forced to the conclusion that philosophy must give up her attempt at ﬁnding the veritates aeternae the business of philosophy is to teach man to live in man who is supremely afraid of uncertainty and who is forever hiding himself behind this or the other dogma more brieﬂy the business of philosophy is not to reassure people but to upset them 12 when man ﬁnds in himself certain defect of which he can by means rid himself there remains but to accept the failing natural quality the more grave and important the defect the more urgent is the need to ennoble it from sublime to ridiculous is only one step and an inera dicable vice in strong men is always rechristened virtue 13 on the whole there is little to choose between metaphysics and positivism in each there is the same horizon but the composition and colouring are different positivism chooses grey colourless paint and ordinary composition metaphysics prefers brilliant colouring and complicated design and always carries the vision away into the inﬁnite in which trick it often succeeds owing to its skill in perspective but the canvas is impervious there is melting through it into the other world nevertheless skilful perspectives are very alluring so that metaphysician s will still have something to quarrel about with the positivists the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https task of writer to go forward and share his impressions with his reader in spite of everything to the contrary he is not obliged to prove anything but because every step of his progress is dogged by those police agents morality science logic and so forth he needs always to have ready some sort of argument with which to frustrate them there is necessity to trouble too deeply about the quality of the argumentation why fret about being inwardly right it is quite enough if the reasoning which comes handiest will succeed in occupying those guardians of the verbal highways whose intention it is to obstruct his passage 15 the secret of poushkin inner harmony poushkin nothing was hopeless nay he saw hopeful signs in everything it is agreeable to sin and it is just delightful to repent it is good to doubt but it is still better to believe it is jolly with feet shod in steel to skate the ice it is pleasant to wander about with gypsies to pray in church to quarrel with friend to make peace with an enemy to swoon on waves of harmony to weep over passing fancy to recall the past to peep into the future poushkin could cry hot tears and he who can weep can hope i want to live so that i may think and suffer he says and it seems if the word to suffer which is so beautiful in the poem just fell in accidentally because there was better rhyme in russian to die the later verses which are intended to amplify to think and to suffer prove this poushkin might repeat the words of the ancient hero danger is dangerous to others but not to therein lies the secret of his harmonious moods 16 the ﬁeld of contemporary thought should be dug up therefore on every possible occasion in season and out the truths must be ridiculed to death and paradoxes uttered in their place then we shall see 17 what is weltanschauung philosophy we all know turgenev was realist and from the ﬁrst he tried to portray life truthfully although we had had precise exponents of realism yet after poushkin it was impossible russian writer to depart too far from actuality even those who did not know what to with real life had to cope with it best they could hence in order that the picture of life should not prove too depressing the writer must provide himself in due season with philosophy this philosophy still plays the part of the magic wand in literature enabling the author to turn anything he likes into anything else most of turgenev works are curious in respect of philosophy but most curious is his diary of superﬂuous man turgenev was the ﬁrst to introduce the term superﬂuous man into russian literature since then an endless amount has been writt en about superﬂuous people although up till now nothing important has been added to what was already said ﬁfty years ago there are superﬂuous people plenty of them but what is to be done with them one knows there remains only to invent philosophies on their behalf in 1850 turgenev then young man thus solved the problem he ends the diary humorous postscript supposed to have been scribbled by an impertinent reader on the last of the this was r eady and contents ther eof disappr oved by peter zudotyeshin dear sir peter zudotyeshin my dear sir it is obvious turgenev felt that after tragedy must follow farce and therein lies the substance of his philosophy it is also obvious that in this feeling he has the whole of european civilisation behind him turgenev was the most educated the most cultured the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https russian writers he spent nearly all his life abroad and absorbed into himse lf all that european learning could offer he knew this although he never directly admitted it owing to an exaggerated modesty which sometimes irritates us by its obviou sness he believed profoundly that only learning only european science could open men eyes to life and explain all that needed explanation according to this belief he judges even tolstoy the saddest instance of the lack of real freedom the turgenev writes of war and peace in his literary memoirs the saddest instance of the lack of real freedom arising from the lack of real knowledge is revealed to us in leo tolstoy latest work work which at the same time by virtue of its creative poetic force ranks almost ﬁrst among all that has appeared in russian literature since without culture without freedom in the widest sense freedom within oneself freedom from preconceived ideas freedom with regard to one own nation and history without this the real artist is unthinkable without this free air he can not breathe listening to turgenev one might imagine that he had learned some great secret in the west secret which gave him the right to bear himself cheerfully and modestly when other people despaired and lost their heads year after the writing of the literary memoirs above quoted turgenev happened to be present at the execution of the notorious murderer tropman his impressions are superbly rendered in long article called tropman execution the description produces effect upon the reader i think i shall not exaggerate if i say that the essay is one of the best at least one of the most vigorous of turgenev writings it is true that tolstoy describes scenes of slaughter with less vigour and therefore the reader need not yield too much to the artist power yet when turgenev relates that at the decisive moment when the executioners like spiders on ﬂy threw themselves on tropman and bore him to the the earth quietly swam away from under my feet are forced to believe him men respond only faintly to the horrors that take place around them except at moments when the savage crying incongruity and ghastliness of our condi tion suddenly reveals itself vivid before our eyes and we are forced to know what we are then the ground slides away from under our feet but not long the horror of the sensation of groundlessness quickly brings man to himself he must forget everything he must only get his feet on earth again in this sense turgenev proved himself in risky state at sixty he was when young man he wrote his diary of superﬂuous man the description of tropman execution ends with these words who can fail to feel that the question of capital punishment is one of the urgent immediate problems which modern humanity must settle i shall be satisﬁed if my story will provide even few arguments those who advocate the abolition or at least the suppression of the publicity of capital punishments again the mountain has brought forth mouse after tragedy farce philosophy enters into her power and the earth returns under one feet i emphasise and repeat turgenev is not alone responsible his attitude with his lips speaks the whole of european civilisation on principle all insoluble problems are rejected during her thousand years of experience the old civilisation has acquired the skill which allows her children to derive satisfaction and beneﬁt out of anything even the blood of their neighbour even the greatest horrors even crimes are beneﬁcial properly construed turgenev was we know soft humane man an undoubted idealist in his youth he had been through the hege lian school and from hegel he learned what an enormous value education has and how supremely important it is an educated man to have complete and certainly ﬁnished philosophy 18 to praise oneself is considered improper immodest to praise one own sect one own philosophy is considered the highest duty even the best writers have taken at least much trouble to glorify their philosophy to found it and have always had more success in the former case than in the latter their ideas whether proven or not are the dearest possession in life to them in sorrow consolation in difﬁculty source of counsel even death is not terrible to ideas they will follow man beyond the grave they are the only imperishable riches all this the philoso phers repeat very eloquently repeat and the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https their ideas not less skilfull y than advocates plead their cases on behalf of thieves and swindlers but nobody has ever yet called philosopher hired conscience though everybody gives the lawyer this nickname why this partiality 19 certain savage tribes believe that their kings need food neither to eat nor to drink matter of fact kings eat and drink and even relish good mouthful more than ordinary mortals so having desire even the sake of form to abstain too long they not infrequently interrupt the t religious ceremonies of their tribes in order to command refreshment their frail bodies but none must witness or even be aware of this refreshing and so while he eats the king is hidden within purple pall metaphysicians remind one of these savage kings they want everyone to believe that empiricism which means all reality and substantial existence is nothing to them they need only pure ideas their existence in order to keep up this ﬁction they appear before the world invested in purple veil of ﬁne words the crowd knows perfectly well that it is all but since it likes shows and bright colours and since also it has ambition to appear too knowing it rarely betrays that it has caught the trick of the comedy on the contrary it loves to pretend to be fooled knowing by instinct that actors always their best when the audience believes implicitly in what happens only inexperienced youths and children unaware of the great importance of the conventional attitude now and then cry out in indignation and give the lie to the performance like the child in andersen story who so unexpectedly and inopportunely broke the general deliberate illusion by calling but the king is naked of course everybody knows without telling that the king is naked that the metaphysicians not only are unable to explain anything but that hitherto they have not been able to present even single hypothesis free from contradiction it is necessary to pretend to believe that kings eat nothing that philosophers have divined the secrets of the universe that arbitrary theories are more precious than empirical harvests and so on there remains only one difﬁculty grownups may be won over to the conventional lie but what about the children with them the only remedy is the pythagorean system of upbringing so gloriﬁed by hegel children must keep silent and not raise their voice until they realise that some things may not be talked about this is our method with us pupils remain silent not only ﬁve years the pythagoreans recommended but ten or they have learned to speak like their masters and then they are granted freedom which is longer any good to them perhaps they had wings or might have had them but they have crawled all their life long in imitation of their masters so how can they now dream of ﬂight to man who has studied much the very thought of the possibility of tearing himself away from the earth even moment is horrifying if he knew beforehand what the result would be 20 the best the most effective way of convincing reader is to begin one argument with inoffensive commonplace assertions when suspicion has been sufﬁciently lulled and certainty has been begot that what follows will be conﬁrmation of the readers own accepted has the moment arrived to speak one mind openly but still in the same easy tone if there were break in the ﬂow of truisms the logical connection is unimportant consequence of manner and intonation is much more impressive than consequence of ideas the thing to is to go on in the same suave tone from uttering series of banalities to expressing new and dangerous thought without any break if you succeed in this the business is done the reader will not new words will plague and torment him until he has accepted them the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https habit of logical thinking kills imagination man is convinced that the only way to truth is through logic and that any depa rture from this way leads to error and absurdity the nearer we approach the ultimate questions of existence in our departure from logicality the more deadly becomes the state of error we fall into the ariadne ball has become all unwound long ago and man is at the end of the tether but he does not know he holds the end of the thread ﬁrmly and marks time with energy on the same spot imagining his progress and little realising the ridiculous situation into which he has fallen how should he realise considering the innumerable precautions he has taken to prevent himself from losing the logical way he had better have stayed at home once he set out once he decided to be theseus and kill the minotaur he should have given himself up forfeited the old attachme nt and been ready never to escape from the labyrinth true he would have risked losing ariadne and this is why long journeys should be undertaken only after family connections have become burden such being the case man deliberately cuts the thread which binds him to hearth and home so that he may have legitimate excuse to his conscience not going back philosophy must have nothing in common with logic philosophy is an art which aims at breaking the logical continuity of argument and bring ing man out on the shoreless sea of imagination the fantastic tides where everything is equally possible and impossible certainly it is difﬁcult given sedentary habits of life to be good philosopher the fact that the fate of philosophy has ever lain in the hands of professors can only be explained by the reluctance of the envious gods to give omniscience to mortals whilst persons are searching truth the apple will stay on the tree the business must be undertaken by homeless adventurers born nomads to whom ubi bene ibi patria it seems to that but his family and his domesticity count tolstoy who lives to such ripe old age might have told us great many important and interesting things or perhaps had he not married like nietzsche he would have gone mad if you turn to the right you will marry if to the left you will be killed true philosopher never chooses the middle course he needs riches he does not know what to with money but whether he turns to the right or to the left nothing pleasant awaits him 22 scratch russian and you will ﬁnd tartar culture is an developm ent and sudden grafting of it upon race rarely succeeds to us in russia civilisation came suddenly whilst we were still savages at once she took upon herself the responsibilities of tamer of wild animals ﬁrst working with decoys and baits and later when she felt her power with threats we quickly submitted in short time we were swallowing in enormous doses those poisons which europe had been gradually accustoming herself to gradually assimilating through centuries thanks to which the transplanting of civilisation into russia turns out to be mild affair russian had only to catch whiff of european atmosphere and his head began to swim he interpreted in his own way whatever he heard of western success hearing about railways agricultural machines schools municipalities his imagination painted miracles universal happiness boundless freedom paradise wings etc and the more impossible his dreams the more eager he was to believe them real how disillusioned with europe the westerner herzen became after living years on end abroad yet with all his acuteness it did not occur to him that europe was not in the least to blame his disillusionment europe had dropped miracles ages ago she contente d herself with ideals it is we in russia who will go on confusing miracles with ideals if the two were identical whereas they have nothing to with each other matter of fact just because europe had ceased to believe in miracles and realised that all human problems resolve down to mere arrangements here on earth ideas and ideals had been invented but the russian bear crept out of his hole and strolled to europe the elixir of life the ﬂying carpet the shoes and so on thinking in all his naïveté that railways and electricity were signs which clearly proved that the old nurse never told lie in her fairy tales all this happened just at the moment when europe had ﬁnally made away with alchemy and astrology and started on the positive researches resulting in chemistry and astronomy the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https the ﬁrst assumption of all metaphysics is that by dialectic development of any concept whole system can be evolved of course the initial concept the priori is generally unsound so there is need to mention the deductions but since it is very difﬁc ult in the realm of abstract thought to distinguish lie from truth metaphysical systems often have very convincing appearance the chief defect only appears incidentally when the taste dialectic play becomes blunted in man it did in turgenev towards the end of his life so that he realises the uselessness of philosophical systems it is related that famous mathematician after hearing musical symphony to the end inquire d what does it prove of course it proves nothing except that the mathematician had taste music and to him who has taste dialectics metaphysics can prove nothing either therefore those who are interested in the success of metaphysics must always encourage the opinion that taste dialectics is high distinction in man proving the loftiness of his soul 24 man is used to having convictions so there we are we can none of us without our though we despise them at the bottom of our souls 25 socrates and plato tried to determine under the shifting change of appearance the immutable unchanging reality in the platonic ideas the attempt was incarn ated the visible reality never true to itself assuming numberless varying forms this is not the genuine reality that which is real must be constant hence the ideas of objects are real and the objects themselves are ﬁctitious thus the root of the platonic philosophy appears to be fundamental defect in human defect regarded the highest merit it is difﬁcult the philosopher to get good grasp of this agitated capricious life and so he decides that it is not life at all but ﬁgment dialectics is supreme only over general the general concepts are promoted to an ideal since plato and socrates only such philosophers have succeeded largely who have taught that the unchan geable is preferable to the changeable the eterna l to the temporal the ordinary individual who lives unconsciously never reckoning his spiritual credit against his spiritu al debit naturally regards the philosopher his legitimate keeper of the soul accounts already in greece the athen ian youth watched with passionate interest the dexterity which socrates displayed in his endeavour to restore by means of dialectics the lost ultimate foundations of human conduct now in we are aware not single farthing must disappear untraceably socrates was trying to come up to expectations the balance between man spiritual assets and liabilities was with him ideally established perhaps in this lies the secret of that strange attraction he exerted even over such volatile and unsteady natures that of alcibiades drawing the young men to him so that they were attached to him with all their soul alcibiades had long since lost all count of his spiritual estate and therefore from time to time he had need to recourse to socrates who by speeches and dissertations could bring order into chaos and harmony into the spiritual confusion of his young friend alcibiades turned to socrates to be relieved of course he sought relief in order that he might begin again his riotous living rest is so sweet to tired man but to conclude that because alcibiades exhausted himself and because rest is sweet therefore all men must rest this is absurd yet socrates dictated this conclusion in all his ideas he wished that all men should rest rest through eternity that they should see their highest fulﬁlment in this resting it is easier to judge of socrates since we have count tolstoy with us probably the physiognomist topir would say of tolstoy he said of socrates that there are many evil propensities lurking in him topir is not here to speak but tolstoy has told us himself how wicked he found his own nature how he had to struggle with it tolstoy is not naturally by long effort he has trained himself to be bold how afraid of death he was in his youth and how cleverly he could conceal that fear later on in mature age it was still the fear of the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https inspired him to write his confession he was conquering that fear and with it all other fears he felt that since fear is very difﬁcult to master in oneself man must be much higher being when he has learned not to be afraid any more meanw hile who knows perhaps cowardice that miserable despicable weakness of the underworld is not such vice after all perhaps it is even virtue think of dostoevsky and his heroes think of hamlet if the underworld man in us were afraid of nothing if hamlet was naturally gladiator then we should have neither tragic poetry nor philosophy it is platitude that fear of death has been the inspiration of philosophers numberless quotations could be drawn from ancient and modern writers if they were necessary maybe the poetic daimon of socrates which made him wise was only fear personiﬁed or perhaps it was his dark dreams that which troubled him by day did not quit him by night even after the sentence of death socrates dreamed that he ought to engage in the arts so in order not to provoke the gods he began to compose verses at the age of seventy tolstoy also at the age of ﬁfty began to perform good deeds to which performance he had previously given not the slightest attention if it were our custom nowadays to express ourselves mythologically we should doubt hear tolstoy telling us about his daimon or his dreams instead he squares his accounts with science and morality in place of gods or demons many alcibiades who laves all the week in the muddy waters of life comes on sundays to cleanse himself in the pure stream of tolstoyian ideas is satisﬁed with this modest success and assumes that if it commands universal attention one day in the week then obviously it is the sum and essence of life beyond which man needs nothing on the same grounds the keepers of public baths could argue that since so many people come to them on saturdays therefore cleanliness is the highest ambition of man and during the week one should stir at all lest he sweat or soil himself 26 in an old french writer contemporary of pascal i came across the following remarkable words est si miserable avec laquelle il abandonne ses desseins est en quelque sorte sa plus grande vertu parce temoigne par là y encore en lui quelque reste grandeur qui le porte dégouter choses qui ne méritent pas son amour et son estime what long way moder n thought has travelled from even the possibility of such an assumption to consider inconstancy the ﬁnest human virtue surely in order to get somewhere in life it is necessary to give the whole self one whole energy to the service of some one particular purpose in order to be virtuoso master of one art and one instrument it is necessary with truly angelic or asinine patience to try over and over again dozens hundreds thousands of times different ways of expressing one ideas or moods sparing neither labour nor time nor health everything else must take second place the ﬁrst must be occupied by the art goncharov in his novel obryv cleverly relates how struggled all day like ﬁsh against the ice sawing and sawing away so that later on in the evening he might play super well and that is the general idea objectionable tedious irritating labour is the condition of genius which doubt explains the reason why men so rarely achieve anything genius must submit to cultivate an ass within condition being so humiliating that man will seldom take up the job the major ity prefer talent that medium which lies between genius and mediocrity and many time towards the end of life does the genius repent of his choice it would be better not to startle the world but to live at one with it says ibsen in his last drama genius is wretched blind maniac whose eccentricities are condoned because of what is got from him and still we all bow to persevering talent to the only god in whom we moderns believe and the eulogy of inconstancy will awake very little sympathy in our hearts probably we shall not even regard it seriously the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https very often express in categorical form judgment of which we not feel assured we even lay stress on its absolute validity we want to see what opposition it will arouse and this can be achieved only by statin g our assumption not tentative suggestion which one will consider but an irrefutable truth the greater the value an assumption has us the more carefully we conceal any suggestion of its improbability 28 literature deals with the most difﬁcu lt and important problems of existe nce and therefore littérateurs consider themselv es the most important of people bank clerk who is always handing money out might just well consider himself millionaire the high estimate placed upon unexplained unsolved questions ought really to discredit writers in our eyes and yet these literary men are so clever so cunning at stating their own case and revealing the high importance of their mission that in the long run they convince everybody themselves most of all this last event is surely owing to their own limited intelligence the romans augurs had subtler more versatile minds in order to deceive others they had need to deceive themselves in their own set they were not afraid to talk about their secrets even to make fun of them being fully conﬁdent that they could easily vindicate themselves before outsiders in case of necessity and pull solemn face beﬁtting the occasion but our writers of before they can lay their improbable assertions before the public must inevitably try to be convinced in their own minds otherwise they can not begin 29 the writer is writing away the reader is reading away writer does care what the reader is after the reader does care what the writer is about such state of things hurt schedrin very much he would have liked it different sooner has the writer said word than the reader at once scales the wall this was his ideal but the reader is by means so naive all that he prefers to rest easy and insists that the writer shall climb the wall him so those authors succeed with the public who write with their heart blood conventional tournaments even the most brilliant not attract the masses any more than the connoisseurs people rush to see ﬁght of gladiators where awaits them scent of real hot smoking blood where they are going to see real not pretended victims thus many writers like gladiators shed their blood to gratify that modern caesar the salve caesar morituri salutant 30 anton tchekhov tells the truth neither out of love or respect the truth nor yet because in the kantian manner high duty bids him never to tell lie even to escape death neither has he the impulse which so often pushes young and ﬁery souls into rashness that desire to stand erect to keep the head high on the contrary tchekhov always walks with stoop his head bent down never ﬁxing his eyes on the heavens since he will read signs there if he tells the truth it is because the most reeking lie longer intoxicates him even though he swallow it not in the modest doses that idealism offers but in immoderate quantities gulps he would taste the bitterness but it would not make his head turn it does schiller or dostoe vsky or even socrates whose head we know could stand any quantity of wine but went spinning with the most commonplace lie 31 noblesse oblige moment of obligation compulsion duty that moment described by kant the essential almost the only predicate of moral concepts serves chieﬂy the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https that kant was modest in himself and in his attitude towards all whom he addressed perceiving in all men beings subject to the ennobling effect of morality noblesse oblige is motto not the aristocracy which recognises in its privileges its own instant duties but the wealthy parvenues who pant an illustrious title they have been accustomed to telling lies to playing poltroon swindling and meanness and the necessity speakin g the truth impartially bravely facing danger freely giving of their fortunes scares them beyond measure therefore it is necessary that they should repeat it to themselves and to their children in whose veins the lying sneaking blood still runs hourly lest they forget you must not tell lies you must be open magnanimous it is silly it is noblesse oblige 32 homo homini lupus is one of the most steadfast maxims of eternal morality in each of our neighbours we fear wolf this fellow is if he is not restrained by law he will ruin us so we think every time man gets out of the rut of sanctiﬁed tradition the fear is just we are so poor so weak so easily ruined and destroyed how can we help being afraid and yet behind danger and menace there is usually hidden something signiﬁcant which merits our close and sympathetic attention but fear eyes are big we see danger danger only we build up fabric of morality inside which in fortress we sit out of danger all our lives only poets have undertaken to praise dangerous don juans fausts tannhaüsers but nobody takes the poets seriously values or don much more highly than byron goethe or molière 33 the possibilities which open out before mankind are sufﬁciently limited it is impossible to see everything impossible to know everything impossible to rise too high above the earth impossible to penetrate too deeply down what has been is hidden away what will be we can not anticipate and we know certain that we shall never grow wings regularity immutably regular successio n of phenomena puts term to our efforts drives us into regular narrow road of everyday life but even on this road we may not wander from side to side we must watch our feet consider each step since the moment we are off our guard disaster is upon us another life is conceivable however life in which the word disaster does not exist where responsibility one actions even if it be not completely abolished at least has not such deadly and accidental weight and where on the other hand there is regularity but rather an inﬁnite number of possibilities in such life the sense of disgraceful to there the virtues are not the same ours fearlessness in face of danger liberality even lavishness are considered virtues with us but they are respected without any grounds socrates was quite right when he argued that not all courage but only the courage which measures beforehand the risks and the chances of victory is fully justiﬁable to the same extent those economical careful people who condemn lavishness are in the right fearlessness and lavishness not suit mortal men rather it becomes them to tremble and to count every penny seeing what state of poverty and impotence they exist in that is why these two virtues are so rarely met with and when they are met why they arouse such superstitious reverence in the crowd this man fears nothing and spares nothing he is probably not man but perhaps even god socrates did not believe in gods so he wanted to justify virtue by reason kant also did not believe in god and therefore he derived his morals from law but if there is god and all men are the children of god then we should be afraid of nothing and spare nothing and then the man who madly dissipates his own life and fortunes and the lives and fortunes of others is more right than the calculating philosophers who vainly seek to regulate mankind on the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https moral people are the most revengeful of mankind they employ their morality the best and most subtle weapon of vengeance they are not satisﬁed with simply despising and condemning their neighbour themselves they want the condemnation to be universal and supreme that is that all men should rise one against the condemned and that even the offender own conscience shall be against him then only are they fully satisﬁed and reassured nothing on earth but morality could lead to such wonderful results 35 inveterate wickedness were often most bitterly persecuted their least digression from accepted belief it was just their obstinacy in triﬂes that irritated the righteous to madness why can they not yield on so triﬂing matter they can not possibly have serious cause opposition they only want to grieve us to spite us so the hatred mounted up piles of faggots and torture machines appeared against obdurate wickedness 36 i not know where i came across the remark whether in tolstoy or turgenev that those who have been subjected to trial in the courts of justice always acquire particularly noble expression of face although logic does so earnestly recommend cauti on in the forming of contradictory conclusions come what may i shall once risk deduction noble expression of face is sign that man has been under certainly not trial political theft or 37 the most important and signiﬁcant revelations come into the world naked without wordy garment to ﬁnd words them is delicate difﬁcult business whole art stupidities and banalities on the contrary appear at once in appar el gaudy even if shabby so that they are ready straight away to be presented to the public 38 strange impatience has taken possessi on of russian writers lately they are all running race after the ultimate words they have doubt that the ultimate words will be attained the question is who will lay hold of them ﬁrst 39 the appearance of socrates on the philosophic horizon is hailed by historia ns the greatest event morals were beginning to work loose athens was threatened with ruin socrates mission was to put an end to the violent oscillation in moral judgme nts which extreme individualism on the one hand and the relativism of the sophists on the other had set up the great teacher did all he could he gave up his usual occupations and his family life he took thought the morrow he taught taught people or eminent wise or foolish ignorant or learned notwithstanding he did not save the country under pericles athens ﬂourished without wisdom or at least independently of socratic wisdom after pericles in spite of the fact that the socratic teaching found such genius plato to continue it athens steadily declined and aristotle is already master to the son of philip of macedon whence it is obvious that the wisdom of socrates had not saved the country and this had been its chief object it had failed in its object and therefore was not worthy of the exaggerated respect it received it is necessary to ﬁnd some justiﬁcation philosophy other than this would be the easiest thing in the world but altogether we must give up the favourite device of the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https of looking to ﬁnd in the of society the raison of philosophy at the best the trick was risky one rule wisdom goes one way society the other they are artiﬁcially connected it is public orators who have trained both the philosophers and the masses to regard worthy of attention only those considerations which have absolutely everything on their side social utility morality even metaphysical wisdom why so much is it not sufﬁcient if some new project will prove useful why try to get the sanct ion of morality and metaphysics nay once the laws of morality are autonomous and once ideas are allowed to stand above the empirical needs of mankind it is impossible to balance ideas and morality with social requirements or even with the salvation of the country from ruin pereat mundus ﬁat philosophia if athens was ruined because of philosophy philosophy is not impugned so the autonomous thinker should hold but facto thinker does not like quarrelling with his country 40 when writer has to express an idea whose foundation he has not been able to establish and which yet is dear to his heart so that he earnestly wishes to secure its general acceptance rule he interrupts his exposition if to take breath and makes small or at times serious digression during which he proves the invalidity of this or that proposition often without any reference to his real theme having triumphantly exposed one or more absurdities and thus acquired the aplomb of solid expert he returns to his proper task calculating that now he will inspire his reader with greater conﬁdence his calculation is perfectly justiﬁed the reader is afraid to attack such skilled dialectician and prefers to agree rather than to risk himself in argument not even the greatest intellects particularly in philosophy disdain such stratagems the idealists example before expounding their theories turn and rend materialism the materialists we remember at one time did the same with the idealists and achieved vast success 41 theories of sequence and consequence are binding only upon the disciples not upon the masters fathers of great ideas tend to be very careless about their progeny giving very little heed to their future career the offspring of one and the same philosopher frequently bear such small resemblance to one another that it is impossible to discern the family connection conscientious disciples wasting away under the arduous effort to discover that which does not exist are brought to despair of their task having got an inkling of the truth concerning their difﬁculty they give up the job ever they cease their attempt at reconciling glaring contradictions but then they only insist the harder upon the necessity studying the philosophers studying them minutely circumstantially historically philologically even so the history of philosophy is born whic h now is taking the place of philosophy certai nly the history of philosophy may be an exact science since by means of historical research it is often possible to decide what exactly certain philosopher did mean and in what sense he employed his peculiar terms and seeing that there have been fair number of philosophers the business of clearing them all up is respectable undertaking and deserves the name of science good translation or commentary on the chief works of kant man may be given the degree of doctor of philosophy and henceforth recognised one who is initiate d in the profundities of the secrets of the universe then why ever should anybody think out new even write them 42 the raptures of creative activity words invented by men who neve r had an opportunity of judging from their own experience but who derive their conclusion syllogistically if creation gives us such delight what must the creator himself experience usually the creator feels only vexations every creation is created out of the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https at the best the maker ﬁnds himself confronted with formless meaningless usually obstinate and stiff matter which yields reluctantly to form and he does not know how to begin every time new thought is gendered so often must that new thought which the moment seems so brilliant and fascinating be thrown aside worthless creative activity is continual progress ion from failure to failure and the condition of the creator is usually one of uncertainty mistrust and shattered nerves the more serious and original the task which man sets himself the more tormenting is the this reason even men of genius can not keep up the creative activity to the last soon they have acquired their technique they begin to repeat themselves well aware that the public willingly endures the monotony of favourite even ﬁnds virtue in it every connoisseur of art is satisﬁed if he recognises in new work the accepted manner of the artist few realise that the acquiring of manner is the beginning of the end artists realise well enough and would be glad to be rid of their manner which seems to them hackneyed affair but this requires too great strain on their powers new torments doubts new groping he who has once been through the creative raptures is not easily tempted to try again he prefers to turn out work according to the pattern he has evolved calmly and securely assured of his results fortunately one except himself knows that he is not any longe r creator what lot of secrets there are in the world and how easy it is to keep one secret safe from indiscreet glances 43 writer works himself up to pitch of ecstasy otherwise he does not take up his pen but ecstasy is not so easily distinguished from other kinds of excitement and writer is always in haste to write he has rarely the patience to wait but at the ﬁrst prom ptings of animation begins to pour himself forth so in the name of ecstasy we are offered such quantities of banal by means ecstatic effusions particularly easy it is to confound with ecstasy that very common sort of liveliness which in our language is and is much more acceptable to the public than true inspiration or genuine transport it is easier more familiar 44 school axiom logical scepticism refutes itself since the denial of the possibility of positive knowledge is already an afﬁrm ation but in the ﬁrst place scepticism is not bound to be logical it has desire whatever to gratify that dogma which raises logic to the position of law secondly where is the philosophic theory which if carried to its extreme would not destroy itself therefore why is more demanded from scepticism than from other systems especially from scepticism which honestly avows that it can not give that which all other theories claim to give 45 the aristotelian logic which forms the chief component in modern logic arose we know result of the permanent contr oversies which were such sport to the greeks in order to argue it is indeed necessary to have common ground in other words to agree about the rules of the game but in our day dialectic tournaments like all other bouts of contention longer attract people thus logic may be relegated to the background 46 in gogol portrait the artist despairs at the thought that he has sacriﬁced art the sake of life in ibsen drama when we dead awaken there is also an artist who has become and who repents that he has sacriﬁced his art now of the two ways of repentance you prefer the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https man is often quite indifferent to success whilst he has it but once he

little creature to begin the work of destruction if other caterpillars could see it how horriﬁed they would be revolted to the bottom of their soul by the awful work in which the insurgent is engaged they would call it immoral godless they would begin to talk about pessimism scepticism and so on to destroy what has cost such labour to construct why what is wrong with this complete cosy comfortable little world to keep it intact they call to their aid sacred morality and the idealistic theory of knowledge nobody cares that the caterpillar has grown wings that when it has nibbled its old nest

the bright earth the majority of books are prisons and great authors are not bad hangmen 50 nietzsche and dostoevsky seem to be typical inverted simulators if one may use the expression they imitated spiritual sanity although they were spiritually insane they knew their morbidity well enough but they exhibited their disease only to that extent where freakishness passes originality with the sensitiveness peculiar to all who are in constant danger they never went beyond the limits the axe of the guillotine of public opinion hung over them one awkwar d move and the execution automatica lly

conquests of the human mind have brought us nothing new here like our ancestors we stand still with fright and perplexity before ugliness disease misery senility death all that the wise men have been able to so far is to turn the earthly horrors into problems we are told that perhaps all that is horrible only appears horrible that perhaps at the end of the long journey something new awaits us

society is severed ﬁnally and since sooner or later every individual is doomed to irremediable unhapp iness the last wor d of philosophy is loneliness 54 it is better to be an unhappy man than happy

proud of it if you have only enough of the actor in you rest assured you will become the hero of the day since the parable of the pharisee and the publican was uttered what lot of people who could not fulﬁl their sacred duties pretended to be publicans and sinners and so aroused sympathy even envy 56 philosophers dearly love to call their utterances truths since in that guise they become binding upon us all but each philosopher invents his own truths which means that he asks his pupils to deceive themselves in the way he shows but that he reserves himself the option of deceiving himself in

loftier to be indignant and angry because of the triumph of evil on earth than because of the disorders of his own physical organs sentimentality he right and is it really nobler 60 real writer disdains to repeat from hearsay events which he has not witnessed it seems to him tedious and humiliating to tell in his own words like schoolboy things which he has ﬁshed out of another man books but can we expect him to stoop to such insigniﬁcance 61 whilst conscience stands between the educated and the lower classes the only possible mediator there can be hope mutual understanding conscience demands sacriﬁces nothing but sacriﬁces it says to the educated man you are happy f people are poor unhappy ignorant renounce therefore your or else soothe your conscience with suave speeches only he who has nothing to sacriﬁce nothing to lose having lost everything can hope to approach the people an equal this is why dostoevsky and nietzsche were not afraid to speak in their own name and did not feel compelled either to stretch up or to stoop down in order to be on level with men 62 not to know what you want is considered shameful weakness to confess it is to lose ever not only the reputation of writer but even of man none the less conscience demands such confession true in this case in most others the demands of conscience are satisﬁed only when they incur very dire consequences leaving

the fear should disappear in old and sick people who ought by nature to look with indifference on death whereas the horro r of death is present in all living things does not this suggest that there is still some other reason the dread and that even where the pangs of horror can not save man from his end still it is necessary and purposeful anguish the explanation here usual stops halfway and fails to lead the human mind to the promised goal 64 moral indignation is only reﬁned form of ancient vengeance once anger spoke with daggers now words will and happy is the man who loving and thirsting to chastise his offender yet is appeased when the offence is punished on account of the gratiﬁcation it offers to the passions morality which has replaced bloody chastisement will not easily lose its charm but there are offences deep unfor gettable offences inﬂicted not by people but by laws of nature how are we to settle these here neither dagger nor indignant word will serve therefore him who has once run foul of the laws of nature morality sinks ever or time into subsidiary importance 65 fatalism frightens people particularly in that form which holds it just to say of anything that happens or has happened or will happen be it so how can one acquiesce in the actuality of life when it contains so many horrors but amor fati does not imply eternal acquiescence in actuality it is only truce more or less lasting period time is needed in which to estimate the forces and intentions of the enemy under the mask of friendship the old enmity persists and an awful revenge is in preparation 66 in the ultimate questions of life we are not bit nearer the truth than our ancestors were everybody knows it and yet so many go on talking about inﬁnity without any hope of ever saying anything it is evident that the usual acceptance of the not necessary in the very last resort we trust to instinct even in the ﬁeld of philosophy where reason is supposed to reign supreme uttering its eternal why why laughs at all possible becauses instinct however does not mock it simply ignores the whys and leads us by impossible ways to ends that our divine reason would hold absurd if it could only see them in time but reason is laggard without much foresight and therefore when we have run up to an unexpected conclusion nothing remains but reason to accept or even to justify to exalt the new event and therefore reality is reasonable say the philoso phers reasonable not only when they draw their philosophic salaries the socialists and with them our philosopher vladimir soloviov explain but still reasonable even when philosophers have their maintenance taken away from them nay in the latter case particularly in the latter case in spite of the socialists and vi soloviov reality shows herself most reasonable philosopher persecuted downtrodden hungry cold receiving salary is nearly always an extreme although this of course by means hinders him from abusing the existing order

religion demanded of him kept his fasts paid his tithes etc had he right to be pleased with his own piety and to despise the erring publican everybody thought so including the pharisee himself the judgment of christ came the greatest surprise to him he had clear conscience he did not merely pretend before others to be righteous he himself believed in his own righteousness and suddenly he turns out guilty awfully guilty but if the conscience of righteous man does not help him to distinguish between good and evil how is he to avoid sin what does kant moral law mean that law which was consoling the starry sky kant lived his life in profound peace of soul he met his death quietly in the consciousness of his own purity but if christ came again he might condemn the serene philosopher his very serenity the pharisee we repeat was righteous if purity of intentions together with ﬁrm readiness to fulﬁl everything which appears to him in the light of duty be righteousness in man 68 we jeer and laugh at man not because he is ridiculous but because we want to have laugh out of him in the same way we are indignant not because this or the other act is revolting to us but because we want to let off our steam but it does not follow from this that we ought always to be calm and smooth woe to him who would try to realise the ideal of justice on earth 69 we think with peculiar

other things that in his corr espondence with friends he gogol succumbs to the fear of death of devils and of hell i ﬁnd the accusation just gogol deﬁnitely feared death demons and hell the point is whether it is not right to fear these things and whether fearlessness would be proof of the high development of man soul schopenhauer asserts that death inspired philosophy all the best poetry all the wonderful mythology of the ancients and of modern peoples have their source the fear of death only modern science forbids men to fear and insists on tranquil attitude towards death so we arrive at utilitarianism and the positivist philosophy if you wish to be rid of both these creeds you must be allowed to think again of death and without shame to fear hell and its devils it may be there is

dealing with literary and philosophic subjects it might have been very i refuse to imagine tolstoy and turgenev keeping up long peaceful correspondence particularly on high subjects nearly every one of turgene v opinions drove tolstoy to madnes s or was capable of so driving him dostoevsky dislike of turgenev was even stronger than tolstoy he wrote of him very spitefully and offensively libelling him rather than drawing caricature evidently dostoevsky like tolstoy detested the european in their confr ere but here he was mistaken in spite of his psychological acuteness to dostoevsky it was enough that turgenev wore european clothes and tried to appear like westerner he himself did the opposite he tried to get rid of every trace of europeanism from himself apparently without great success since he failed to make clear to himself wherein lay the strength of europe and where her sting nevertheless the late mikhailovsky is not wrong in calling dostoevsky seeker of buried treasure surely in the second half of his literary activity dostoevsky longer sought the real fruits of life there awoke in him the russian the elemental man with thirst the miraculous compared with what he wanted the fruits of european civilisation seemed to him trivial ﬂat insipid the civilisation of his neighbours told him that there never had been miracle and never would be but all his being not yet by civilisation craved the stupendous unknown therefore the progressivist enraged him tolstoy once said of turgenev i hate his democratic backside dostoevsky might have repeated these words and now the gratiﬁcation of the german critic please reconcile the russ ian writers and make them talk serenely on ﬂown matters dostoevsky was within of quarrel with tolstoy with whom not long before death interrupted him he began long controversy concerning anna karenina even tolstoy seemed to him too compliant too accommodating 78 we rarely make display of that which is dear to us near and dear and necessary on the other hand we readily exhibit that which is of importance to is nothing else to be done with it man takes his mistress to the theatre and sticks her in full view of everybody he prefers to remain at home with the woman he loves or to go about with her quietly unnoticed so with our virtues every time we notice in ourselves some quality we not prize we haste to make show of it thinking perhaps that someone would be glad of it if it wins us approval we are there is some gain to an actor writer or an orator his own antics without which he can have success with the public are often disgusting and yet his knack of antics he considers talent divine gift and he would rather die than that it should be lost to the public talent on the whole is accounted divine gift only because it is always on show because it serves the public in some way or other all our judgments are permeated through and through with utilitarianism and were we to attempt to purify them from this adulteration what would remain of modern philosophy that is why youngish inexperienced writers usually believe in harmonia praestabilitata even though they have never heard of leibnitz they persuade themselves that there is breach between egoistic and idealistic aspirations that instance thirst fame and desire to serve mankind are one and the same thing such persuasion is usually very tenacious of life and lasts long in men of vigorous and courageous mind it seems to that the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https not have lost it even had he lived to prolonged old age it was also part of turgenev man of his spiritual ﬁbre could have any belief tolstoy now believed and now disbelieved according to the work he had in hand when he had other people ideas to destroy he doubted the identity of egoistic and idealist aspirations when he had his own to defend he believed in it which is line of conduct worthy of attention and supremely worthy of imitation human truths are proper exclu sively ancillary purposes 79 man is such conservative creature that any change even change the better scares him he prefers the bad old way to the new good one man who has been all his life conﬁrmed materialist would not consent to believe that the soul was immortal not if it were proved to him more geometrico and not if he were constitutional coward fearing death like shakespeare falstaf then we must take human conceit into account men not like to admit themselves wrong it is absurd but it is so men trivial wretched creatures proved by history and by every common event to be bunglers yet must needs consider themselves infallible omnisci ent what why not admit their ignorance ﬂatly and frankly true it is easier said than done but why should slavish intellect in spite of our desire to be straightforward deck us out with truths of which we can not divest ourselves even when we know their ﬂimsiness socrates wanted to think that he knew he could not bring it off he most absorbedly believ ed in his own knowledge nothing could be truth except his teaching he accepted the decree of the oracle and sincerely esteemed himse lf the wisest of men and so it will be long philosophers feel it their duty to teach and to save their neighbours if man wants to help people he is bound to become liar we should undertake doubt seriously not in order to return at length to established beliefs that would be vicio us circle experience shows us that such process certainly in the development of ultimate questions only leads from error to error we should doubt so that doubt becomes continuous creative force inspiring the very essence of our life established knowledge argues in us condition of imperfect receptivity the weak ﬂabby spirit can not bear quick ceaseless change it must look round it must have time to gather its wits and so it must under go the same experience time after time it needs the support and the security of habit but the soul despises your crutches he is tired of crawling on his own cabbage patch he tears himself away from his own native soil and takes himself off into the far distances braving the inﬁnitude of space surely everybody knows we are not to live in the world ever but cowardice prevents one straightforward admitting of it we keep it close till there is an occasion to air it truism only when misfortune disease old age come upon us then the dread fear of departure walks with us like our own skeleton we can not dismiss him at length involuntarily we begin to examine our gruesome companion with curiosity and then strangely enough we observe that he not only tortures us but keeping pace with us he has begun to gnaw through all the thread s that bind us to the old existence at moments it seems if few more threads gone nothing nothing will remain to hold us back the eternal dream of crawling man will be fulﬁlled we shall be released from the bonds we shall betake ourselves in liberty to regions far from this damned vale of earth 80 moralists are abused because they offer us moral consolations this is not quite fair moralists would joyfully substitute palpable blessings their abstract gifts if they could when he was young tolstoy wanted to make men happy when he was old and knew he could not make them happy he began to preach renunciation resignation and so forth and how angry he got when peop le would have his teaching but if instead of foisting his doctrines off on us the solution of the ultimate problems and optimism he had only spoken of the impossibility of ﬁnding satisfactory answers and have offered himself pessimist he would probably have obtained much more willing the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https he is annoying because ﬁnding himself unable to relieve his neighbours he turns to them and insists that they shall consider themselves relieved by him nay even made happy by him to which many will not agree why should they voluntarily renounce their rights since although god knows the right of quarrelling with one fate and cursing it is not very grand right still it is right 81 ivanov in tchekhov drama of that name compares himself to an overstrained labourer the labourer dies so that all that remains to ivanov is to die but logic you know recommends great caution in coming to conclusions by analogy behold tchekhov himself who far we can judge had endured in his own soul all the tragedy just ivanov had did not die or think of dying or even turn out wasted man he is doing something he struggles he seeks his work seems important and considerable to us just like other human works ivanov shot himself because the drama must end while tchekhov had not yet ﬁnished his own struggle our aesthetics demand that the drama must have climax and ﬁnale though we have abandoned the aristotelian unities given little more time however dramatic writers will have got rid of this restriction also they will frankly confess that they not know how or with what event to end their dramas stories have already learnt to dispense with an ending 82 more of the says now where is my salvation in what if an intelligent educated healthy man discoverable reason sets up lazarus lament and starts to roll down an inclined plane then he is rolling without resisting and there is salvation him one way out would be to accept the inclined plane and the gathering impetus normal even further one might ﬁnd in the rolling descent proof of one spiritual superiority to other men of course in such case one should go apart from the rest not court young girls or fraternise with those who are living the ordinary life but be alone love is nonsense caresses maudlin work is meaningless and song and ﬁery speeches are banal continued ivanov to young sasha these words are horrible ivanov will be responsible them he is already responsible them that he is tottering is nothing it is still full early him to shoot himself he will live whilst his creator tchekhov lives and we shall listen to the shaky vacillating philosoph we are so sick of symmetry and harmony and ﬁnality sick we are of bourgeois complacency 83 it will be seen from the above that already in ivanov one of his early works tchekhov has assumed the rôle of advocatus diaboli wherever ivanov appears he brings ruin and destruction it is true tchekhov hesitate s to take his side openly and evidently does not know what to with his hero so that in the end he shakes him off so to speak he washes his hands of him in the accepte d fashion ivanov shoots himself in the sight of everybody has not even time to go discreetly into corner the only justiﬁcation of ivanov is that caricature of honesty doctor lvov lvov is not living is obvious but this is why he is remarkable it is remarkable that tchekhov should deem it necessary to resurrect the forgotten starodoum that utterer of truisms in isin comedy and to resurrect him longer that people may bow their heads before the incarnation of virtue but so that they shall jeer at him look at doctor lvov is he not starodoum alive again he is honesty personiﬁed from force of old habit honesty sticks his chest out and speaks in loud voice with imperious tone and yet not one of this old loyal subjects gives brass farthing him they even trouble to gibe at him but spit on him and shove him through the door disgusting and impudent toady poor honesty what has he sunk to evidently virtues like everything else should not live too long on the project gutenberg ebook of all things are

brute 85 groundless assumptions based on nothing because they seem to derive from common assumption of the reasonableness of human existence which assumption surely is the child of our desires and probably bastard at that in his miserly knight poushkin represented miser romantic ﬁgure gogol with his plyushkin creates on the contrary repulsive ﬁgure of miser gogol was nearer to reality miser is ugly whatever view you take of or outward yet gogol ought not to teach people to preserve in their age the ideals of their youth once old age is upon must not be improved upon much less apologised it must be accepted and its essence brought to light plyushkin the vulgar dirty mani ac is who knows perhaps he is fulﬁlling the serious mission of his own being he is possessed by one everything else to all happenings in the outer world he is indifferent it is the same to him whether he is hungry or full warm or cold clean or dirty practically event can distract his attention from his single purpose he is disinterestedly mean if one may say so he has need his riches he lets them rot in disgusting heap and does not dream like poushkin knight of palaces and power or of sportive nymphs upon what end is he concentrated one has the time to think it out at the sight of plyushkin everyone recalls the damage the miser has done everyone of course is right plyushkins who heap up fortunes to let them rot are very harmful the social judgment is nearly always to the point but not quite always it wo hurt morals and social considerations if at times they have to hold their at such times we might succeed in guessing the riddle of meanness sordidness old age the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https have sufﬁcient grounds taking life mistrustfully it has defrauded us so often of our cherished expectations but we have still stronger grounds mistrustin g reason since if life deceived us it was only because futile reason let herself be deceived perhaps reason herself invented the deception and then to serve her own ambitious ends threw the blame on life so that life shall appear but if we have to choose between life and reason we choose life and then we longer need try to foresee and to explain we can wait and accept all that is unalterable part of the game and thus nietzsche having realised that all his hopes had gradually crumbled and that he could never get back to his former strength but must grow worse and worse every day wrote in private letter of may 28 1883 ich will es so schwer haben wie nur irgend ein mensch es hat erst writer diesem drucke gewinne ich gute gewissen dafür etwas zu besitzen wenige menschen haben und gehabt haben flügel im gleichnisse zu reden in these few simple words lies the key to the philosophy of nietzsche 87 so long apollo calls him not to the sacred offering of all the triﬂing children of men the most triﬂing perhaps is the poet put poushkin expression into plain language and you will get page on neuropathology all neurasthenic individuals sink from state of extreme excitation to one of complete prostration poets too and they are proud of it 88 shy people usually receive their impres sions during those moments when an event is taking place before their eyes they can see nothing only later on havin g evoked from their memory fragment of what happened they make thems elves an impression of the whole scene and then retrospectively arise in their soul feelings of pity offence surprise so vivid if they were the ﬂames of the instant moment not rekindlings from the past thus shy people always think great deal and are always too late their work it is never too late thought timid before others they reach great heights of daring when alone they are bad often excellent writers their life is insigniﬁcant and tedious they are not noticed they become famous and by the time fame comes they not need popular attention any more 89 if tchekhov layevsky in the duel had been writer with literary talent people would have said of him that he was original and that he was engaged in the study of the mysticism of sex like gabriele example whereas he stands he is only banal his idleness is reproach to him people would prefer that at least he should copy out extracts from documents 90 from observations on childr in man strikes us unpleasantly because it betrays our poverty i can not dole out my abundance to my neighbour if i i myself shall be left with little we should like to be able to scatter riches with royal hand and therefore when we see someone else clutching his rags with the phrase property is sacred we are hurt what is sacred comes from the gods and the gods have plenty of everything they not count and skimp like mortals 91 we see man repent his actions and conclude that such actions should be avoided an instance of false but apparently irrepro achable reasoning time passes and we see the same man repenting again of the acts if we love logic this will conﬁrm us in our ﬁrst conclusion but if we not care logic we shall say man is under an the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https to commit these acts and to repent of them sometimes however the ﬁrst conclusion is corrected differently having decided that repentance proves that certain course of action should be avoided man avoids it all his life only to realise in the end suddenly with extraordinary clarity how bitter is his regret that he has not trodden the forbidden course but by this time new conclusion is already useless life is over and the mind longer knows how to rid itself of the superﬂuous light 92 version of one of the scenes of tolstoy power of darkness reminds us exactly of piece of maeterlinck there can be question of imitation when the power of darkness was written nobody had heard of maete rlinck tolstoy evidently wanted to try new method of creating and to get rid of his own manner which he had evolved through tens of years of dogged labour but the risk was too great he preferred to cure himself of his doubts by the common expedient manual toil and an outdoor life so he took up the plough 93 every woodcock praises its own fen lermontov saw the sign of spiritual in dazzling white linen and therefore his heroes always dressed with taste dostoevsky on the other hand despised show dmitri karamazov wears dirty d this is assigned to him merit or almost merit 94 while he was yet young when he wrote his story enough turgenev saw that something terrible hung over his life he saw but did not get frightened although he under stood that in time he ought to become frightened because life without continual inner disturbance would have meaning him 95 napoleon is reputed to have had profound insight into the human soul shakespeare also and their vision has nothing in common 96 what we call imagination which we value so highly in great essentially unbridled loose or if you will even perverted mentality in ordinary mortals we call it vice but to the poets everything is forgiven on account of the beneﬁt and pleasure we derive from their works in spite of our theories we have always been extremely practical great utilitarians years went by before tolstoy got up and in his turn offered the poets their choice either to be virtuous or to stop creating and forfeit the fame of teachers if tolstoy did not make laughing of himself he has to thank his grey hairs and the respect which was felt his past anyhow nobody took him seriously far from it never yet did poets feel so free from the shackles of morality they now if schiller were writing his dramas and philosophic essays he would scarcely ﬁnd reader in tolstoy himself it is not so much his virtues his vices which we ﬁnd interesting we begin to understand his works not so much in the light of his striving after ideals but from the standpoint of that incongruity which existed between the ideas he artiﬁcially imposed upon himself and the demands of his own ous soul which struggled ever liberty nicolenka irtenyev in childhood and youth would sit hours on the terrace turning over in his mind his elder brother volodya aking with the chambermaids but although he desired it more than anything on earth he could never bring himself to be like volodya the maid said to the elder brother why does nicolai fetrovitch ever come here the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https lark she did not know that nicolai petrovitch was sitting at that moment under the stairs ready to give anything on earth to take the place of the scamp volodya everything on earth is twice repeated tolstoy gives psychological explanation of his little hero conduct i was timid by nature nicolenka tells us but my shyness was increased by the conviction of my ugliness ugliness the consciousness of one ugliness leads to shyness what good can there be in virtue which has such suspicious origin and how can the morality of tolstoy heroes be trusted i consciousness of one ugliness begets shyness shyness drives the passions inwards and allows them natural outlet little by little there develops monstrous discrepancy between the imagination and its desires on the one hand and the power to satisfy these desires on the other permanent hunger and contracted alimentary canal which does not pass the food through hence the hatred of the imagination with its unrealised and unrealisable cravings in our day one has scour ged love so cruelly tolstoy in power of darkness but the feats of the village don juan need not necessarily end in tragedy more than anything on earth however tolstoy hates the don juans the handsome brave successful the who spontaneously act upon suggestion the conquerors of women who stretch out their hands to living statues cold stone far ever he can he has his revenge on them in his writing 97 in the drama of the future the whole presentation will be different first of all the difﬁculties of the dénouement will be set aside the new hero has but present neither wife nor sweetheart nor friends nor occupation he is alone he communes only with himself or with imaginary listeners he lives life apart so that the stage will represent either desert island or room in large ated city where among millions of inhabitants one can live alone on desert island the hero must not return to people and to social ideals he must go forward to loneliness to absolute loneliness even now nobody looking at gogol plyushkin will feel any more the slightest response to the pathetic appeal men to preserve the ideals of youth on into old age modern youths go to see plyushkin not the sake of laughing at him or of beneﬁting from the warning which his terrible miserly ﬁgure offers them but in order to see if there may not be some few little pearls there where they could be least expected in the midst of his heap of dirt lycurgus succeeded in ﬁxing the spartans like cement some after that came the thaw and all their hardness melted the last remains of the petriﬁed doric art are now removed to museums is something 98 if i sow not in the spring in autumn i shall eat bread every day brings troubles and worries enough poor weak man he had to forget his work moment and now he is lost he will die of hunger or cold in order merely to preserve our existence we have to strain mind and body to the utmost nay more we have to think of the surrounding world exclusively with view to gaining livelihood from it there is time to think about truth this is why positivism was invented with its theory of natural development really everything we see is mysterious and incomprehensible tiny midge and huge elephant caressing breeze and blizzard young tree and rocky are all these what are they why are they we incessantly ask ourselves but we may not speak out philosophy is ever pushed aside to make room the daily needs only those think who are unable to trouble about or who will not trouble or who are too careless that is sick desperate or lazy people these return to the riddle which workaday men conﬁrmed in the certainty that they are right have construed into naturalness the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https and after him schopenhauer was exceedingly fond of the epithet disinterested and used it on every occasion when the supply of laudatory terms he had at his disposal was exhausted disinterested thinking which does not pursue any practical aim is according to schopenhauer the highest ideal towards which man can strive this truth he considered universal an priori but had he chanced to be brought amongst russian peasants he would have had to change his opinion with them thoughts about destiny and the why and wherefore of the universe and inﬁnity and so on would by means be considered disinterested particularly if the man who devoted himself to such thoughts were at the same time to announce becomes philosopher that he claimed complete freedom from physical labour there the philosopher were he even plato would be stigmatised with the disgraceful nickname there the highest activity is interested activity directed towards strictly practical purposes and if the peasants could speak learnedly they would certainly call the principle upon which their judgment is founded an priori tolstoy who draws his wisdom from the attacks the learned the very fact that they not want to work but are disinterestedly occupied in the search truth 100 it is clear to any impartial observer that practically every man changes his opinion ten times day much has been said on this subject it has served innumerable satires and humorous sketches nobody has ever doubted that it was vice to be unstable is one opinions of our education goes to teaching us most carefully to conceal within ourselves the changeableness of our moods and judgments man who can not keep his word is the last of men never to be trusted likewise man with ﬁrm convictions it is impossible to work together with him morality here always making towards utilitarian ends issues the eternal principle thou shalt remain true to thy convictions in cultured circles this commandment is considered so unimpeachable that men are terriﬁed even to appear inconstant in their own eyes they become petriﬁed in their beliefs and greater shame can happen to them than that they should be forced to admit that they have altered in their convictions when straightforward man like montaigne plainly speaks of the inconstancy of his mind and his views he is regarded libeller of himself one need neither see nor hear nor understand what is taking place around one once your mind is made up you have lost your right to grow you must remain stock statue the qualities and defects of which are known to everybody 101 every philosophic starts from some or other solution of the general problem of human existence and proceeds from this to direct the course of human life in some particular direction or other we have neither the power nor the data the solution of general problems and consequently all our moral deductions are arbitrary they only witness to our prejudices if we are naturally timid or to our propensities and tastes if we are but to keep up prejudices is miserable unworthy business nobody will dispute that therefore let us cease to grieve about our differences in opinion let us wish that in the future there should be many more differences and much less unanimity there is arbitrary truth it remains to suppose that truth lies in changeable human tastes and desires in so far our common social existence demands us try to come to an understanding to agree but not one jot more any agreement which does not arise out of common necessity will be crime against the holy spirit 102 tchekhov was very good at expounding system of several systems we have examples in more than one of his stories particularly in the duel where koren speaks ex cathedra but tchekhov had use such systems save purely literary purposes when you write story and your hero must speak clearly the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https system has its value but when you are left to yourself can you seriously trouble your soul about philosophy even german can not it seems go so far in his idealism vladimir semionovitch the young author in tchekhov nice people sincerely and deeply believes in his own ideas but even of him notwithstanding his blatantly comical limitations we can not say more than that his ideas were constant little views or pictures to him which had gradually become second natural setting to everything he saw certainly he did not live by ideas tchekhov is right when he says that the singing of gaudeamus igitur and the writing of humanitarian appe al were equally important to vladimir semionovitch soon vladimir sister begins to think herself her brother highest ideas which she has formerly revered become banal and objectionable to her her brother can not understand her neither her hostility to progress and humanitarianism nor to the university spree and gaudeamus igitur but tchekhov does understand only let us admit the word understand does not carry its ordinary meaning here so long the child was fed on its mother milk everything seemed to it smooth and easy but when it had to give up milk and take to vodka this is the inevitable law of human childish suckling dreams receded into the realm of the irretrievable past 103 the summit of human existence say the philosophers is spiritual serenity aequanimitas but in that case the animals should be our ideal in the matter of imperturbability they leave nothing to be desired look at grazing sheep or cow they not look before and after and sigh what is not given good pasture the present sufﬁces them perfectly 104 hungry man was given piece of bread and kind word the kindness seemed more to him than the bread but had he been given only the kind word and bread he would perhaps have hated nice phrases theref ore caution is always to be recommended in the drawing of conclusions and in none more than in the conclusion that truth is more urgently required than consoling lie the connections of isolated phenomena can very rarely be discerned rule several causes at once produce one effect owing to our propensity idealising we always make prominent that cause which seems to us loftiest 105 strange anomaly we see thousands of human beings perish around us yet we walk warily lest we crush worm the sense of compassion is strong in us but it is adapted to the conditions of our existence it can relieve an odd case here and it raises terriﬁc outcry over triﬂing injustice yet schopenhauer wanted to make compassion the metaphysical basis of morality 106 to discard logic an instrument means or aid acquiring knowledge would be extravagant why should we the sake of consequentialism logic very self but logic an aim in itself or even the only means to knowledge is different matter against this one must ﬁght even if he has against him all the authorities of with aristotle 107 when the yellowing sway and are moved and the fresh forest utters sound to the breeze then i see happiness on earth and god in heaven it may be so to the poet the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https it may be quite different sometimes the waves the woods make noise in the wind the stream whispers its best tales and still man can not perceive happiness nor forget the lesson taught in childhood that the blue heavens are only an optical illusion but if the sky and the boundless ﬁelds not convince is it possible that the arguments of kant and the commentations of his dozens of talentless followers can anything 108 the greatest temptation dostoevsky grand inquisitor lurks dreadful idea who can be sure he of when the cruciﬁed christ uttered his cry lord why hast thou forsaken he did not call to mind the temptation of satan who one word had offered him dominion over the world and if jesus recollected this offer how can we be sure that he did not repent not having taken it one had better not be told about such temptations 109 from the futur opinions concerning contemporary europe europe of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries presented strange picture after luther christianity degenerated into morality and all the threads connecting man with god were cut together with the rationalisation of religion all life took on ﬁat rational character knights were replaced by standing army recruited on the principle of compulsory military service all and existing chieﬂy the purpose of parades and ofﬁcial needs alchemy which had been trying to ﬁnd the philosopher stone was replaced by chemistry which tried to discover the best means cheap preparation of cheap commodities astrology which had sought in the stars the destinies of men was replaced by astronomy which foretold the eclipses of the sun and the appearing of comets even the dress of the people became strangely colourless not only men but women also wore uniform monochromatic clothes most remarkable of all that epoch did not notice its own insigniﬁcance but was even proud of itself it seemed to the man of that day that never before had the common treasury of spiritual riches been so well replenished we of course may smile at their naïveté but if one of their own number had allowed himself to express an opinion disdainful of the bases of the contemporary culture he would have been declared immoral or put away in terrible punishment very common in that coarse period though now it is very difﬁcult even to imagine what such proceeding implied but in those days to be known immoral or to ﬁnd oneself in was worse than to die one of the famous poets of the nineteenth century alexander poushkin said forbid that i should go mad rather let be starving beggar in those times people on the whole were compelled to tell lies and play the hypocrite so that not infrequently the brightest minds who saw through the shams of their epoch yet pretended to believe in science and morality only in order to escape the persecution of public opinion 110 writers of tragedies on shakespear model obtain spark one must strike with all one might with an iron upon stone whereupon there is loud noise which many are inclined to believe more important than the little spark similarly writers having shouted very loudly are deeply assured that they have fulﬁlled their sacred mission and are amazed that all not share their raptures that some even stop their ears and run away 111 metamorphoses and folly are not at all native qualities in man in crisis stupid man becomes clever we need not go far an example what gaping simpleton dostoevsky looks in his injur ed and insulted not to mention poor folk but in letters from the underworld and the rest of his books he is the shrewdest and cleverest the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https the same may be said of nietzsche tolstoy or shakespeare in his birth of tragedy nietzsche seems just like the ordinary honest rather simple provincial german student and in zarathustra he reminds one of machiavelli poor shakespeare got himself into row his man could deny the great mind in hamlet the best instance of all however is tolstoy right up to whenever he likes he can be cleverer than the cleverest yet at times he is schoolboy this is the most interesting and enviable trait in him 112 in troilus and cressida thersites says shall the elephant ajax carry it thus he beats and i rail at him worthy satisfaction would it were otherwise that i could beat him whilst he railed at dostoevsky might have said the same of his opponents he pursued them with stings sarcasm abuse and they drove him to white heat by their quiet assurance and composure the admirers of dostoevsky quietly believe in the teachings of their master does it not mean that facto they have betrayed him and gone over to the side of his enemies 113 the opinion has gained ground that turgenev ideal elena marianna created in the image and likeness of poushkin tatyana the critics have been misled by external appearances to poushkin his tatyana appears vestal guarding the sacred ﬂame of high such job is not ﬁtting male the pretender in boris godunov says to the old monk pimen who preaches meekness and submission but you fought under the walls of kazan etc that is man work but in the hours of peace and leisure the ﬁghter needs his own he must feel assured that at home his rights are safely guarded this is the point of tatyana last words i belong to another and shall remain forever true to him but in turgenev woman appears the judge and the reward sometimes even the inspirer of victorious man there is great difference 114 from german introduction to philosophy w shall maintain the opinion that metaphysics the crown of the particular sciences is possible and desirable and that to it falls the task intermediate between theory and practice experiment and anticipation mind and feeling the task of weighing probabilities balancing arguments and reconciling difﬁculties thus metaphys ics is weighing of probabilities than probable conclusions it can not go thus why metaphysicians pretend to universal and obligatory established and eternal judgments they go beyond themselves in the domain of metaphysics there can not and must not be any established beliefs the word established loses all its sense in the connection it is reasonable to speak of eternal hesitation and temporality of thought 115 from another introduction to philosophy also german compared with the delusion of the materialists the wretchedest worshipper of idols seems to us being capable of apprehending to certain degree the great meaning and essence of things perhaps this thought strayed in accidentally among the huge herd of the other thoughts of the professor so little does it resemble the rest but even so it loses none of its interest if the materialists here spoken of those of the nineteenth century buchner vogt moleschot all of them men who stood on the pinnacle of natural science were capable of proving in the realm of philosophy more uninformed than the nakedest savage then it follows not only that science has nothing in common with philosophy but that the two are even hostile therefore we ought to go to the savages not to civilise them but even to the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https from them papuan or tierra del fuegan delivering lecture in philosophy to the professors of the berlin paulsen is curious sight i say to friedrich paulsen and not to buchner or moleschot because paulsen is also an educated person and therefore his philosophic sensibility may have suffered from contact with science even if not so badly that of the materialists he needs the assistance of master why have german professors so little daring or enterprise why should not paulsen on his own initiative go to patagonia to perfect himself in philosophy at least send his pupils there and preach broadcast the new pilgrimage and now lo and behold he has hatched an original and fertile idea so he will stick in corner with it so that even if you wanted you could not get good look at it the idea is important and weighty our philosophers would lose nothing by sitting at the feet of the savages 116 from history of ethics doubts concerning the existence or the possibility of discovering moral norm have of course i underline it proved stimulus to new speculative establishing of ethics just the denial of the possibility of knowledge led to the discovery of the condition of knowledge with this proposition the author does not play paulsen with his he places it in conspicuous position in conspicuous section of his book and accompanies it with the trumpeting herald of course but only one thing is clear namely that the majority share the opinion of professor yodl to whom the quoted words belong so that the ﬁrst assumption of ethics has its foundation the consensus sapientium it is enough 117 the normative theory which has taken such hold in germany and russia bears the stamp of that free and easy which characterises the state of contentment and which does not desire even the sake of theoretical perfection to take into consideration the divided state of soul which usually accompanies discontent windelband praeludien 313 is evidence of this he exposes himself with the naive frankness almost of an irrational creature and is not only unashamed but even proud of his part philosophic research he says is possible only to those who are convinced that the norm of the universal imperative is supreme above individual activities and that such norm is discoverable not every witness will give evidence so honestly it amounts to this that philosophic resea rch is not search after truth but conspiracy amongst people who dethr one truth and exalt instead the norm the task is truly ethical morality always was and always will be utilitarian and bullying its active principle is he who is not with us is against us 118 if besides the reality which is evident to us we were susceptible to another form of reality chaotic lawless then this latter could not be the subject of thought philosophie der gegenwart this is one of the priori of critical of the unproved ﬁrst assumptions evidently it is only an expression in other words of windelband assertion quoted above concerning the ethical basis of the law of causation thus the priori of contemporary thought convince us more and more that nietzsche instinct was not at fault the root of all our philosophies lies not in our objective observations but in the demands of our own heart in the subjective moral will and therefore science can not be uprooted except we ﬁrst destroy morality 119 one of the lofty the philosopher conquers passion by perceiving it the artist by bodying it forth in german it sounds still more lofty but does not that the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https any

well if the problem of knowledge is to fathom all the depths of actual life then experience in so far it repeats itself is uninteresting or at least has limit of interest it is necessary however to know what nobody yet knows and therefore we must walk not on the common road of allgemeingültigkeit but on new tracks which have never yet seen human feet thus morality which lays down deﬁnite rules and thereby guards life time from any surprise exists only by convention and in the end collapses before the of individual human aspirations of only regulating value and are necessary only to those who want rest and security but the ﬁrst and essential condition of life is lawlessne ss laws are refreshing ssness is creative activity 121 say that logic does not need this postulate and could easily develop it by deduction i think not on the contrary in my opinion logic could not exist without this premiss meanwhile it has purely empirical origin in the realm of fact is always more or less equal to but it might be otherwise the universe might be so constituted to admit of the most fantastic metamorphoses that which now equals would successively equal b and then c and so on at present stone remains long enough stone plant plant an animal an animal but it might be that stone changed into plant before our eyes and the plant into an animal that there is nothing unthinkable in such supposition is proved by the theory of evolution this theory only puts centuries in place of seconds so that in spite of the risk to which i expose myself from the admirers of the famous epicurean system i am compelled to repeat once more that anything you please may come from anything you please that may not equal and that consequently logic is dependent its soundness on the law of the unchangeableness of the external world admit the possibility of supernatural logic will lose that certitude and inevitability of its conclusio ns which at present is so attractive to us 122 the effort to understand people life the universe prevents us from getting to know them at all since to know and to understand are two concepts which are not only identical but just the opposite of one another in meaning in spite of their being in constant use synonyms we think we have understood phenomenon if we have included it in list of others previously known to us and since all our mental aspiration reduces itself to understanding the universe we refuse to know great deal which will not adapt itself to the plane surface of the contemporary instance the leibnitz question put by kant into the basis of the critique of reason how can we know thing outside us if it does not enter into us it is that is it does not agree with our notion of understanding hence it follows that it must be squeezed out of the ﬁeld of is exactly what kant attempted to to us it seems on the contrary that in the interests of knowing we should sacriﬁce and gladly understanding since understanding in any case is

the change true the idealists will hasten to say that love overcomes all things but idealism needs be prompt if she leaves us one single moment in which to see we shall see such things are not easily explained away that is why idealists stick so tight so logic in the twinkling of an eye logic will convey us to the remotest conclusions and forecasts reality could never overtake her love is eternal

conclude that the most generous human impulses spring from root of egoism tolstoy love to one neighbour example proves to be branch of the old the same may be said of kant idealism and even of plato though they glorify the service of the idea in practice they succeed in getting out of the vicious circle of egoism better than the ordinary mortal who is neither genius nor ﬂower of culture in my eyes this is almost an absolute truth it is never wrong to add the retractive almost truth is too much inclined to exaggerate its own importance and one must guard oneself against its despotic authority men are egoists hence follows great deal i even think this proposition might provide better grounds metaphysical conclusions than the doubtful capacity compassion and love one neighbour which has been so tempting to dogma some reason men have the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https love oneself is more natural and comprehensible than love another why love others is only less widely diffused than love to oneself but then hippopotami and rhinoceros even in their own tropical regions are less frequent than horses and mules does it follow that they are less natural and transcendental positivism is not incumbent upon savages nay we know many of them are less than our learned men instance future life is to them such an infallible reality that they even enter into contracts part of which is to be fulﬁlled in the next world german metaphysician wo go far that hence it follow s that the way to know the other world is not by any means through love sympathy and denial schopenhauer taught on the contrary it appears if love others were only an impediment to metaphysical ﬂights love and sympathy chain the eye to the misery of this earth where such wide ﬁeld active charity opens out the materia lists were mostly very good fact which bothered the historians of philosophy they preached matter believed in nothing and were ready to perform all kinds of sacriﬁces their neighbours how is this it is case of clearest logical consequence man loves his neighbour he sees that heaven is indifferent to misery therefore he takes upon himself the rôle of providence were he indifferent to the sufferings of others he would easily become an idealist and leave his neighbours to their fate love and compassion kill belief and make man positivist and materialist in his philosophical outlo if he feels the misery of others he leaves off meditating and wants to act man only thinks properly when he realises he has nothing to his hands are tied that is why any profound thought must arise from despair optimism on the other hand the readiness to jump hastily from one conclusion to another may be regarded an inevitable sign of narrow which dreads doubt and is consequently always superﬁ cial if man offers you solution of eternal questions it shows he has not even begun to think about them he has only acted perhaps it is not necessary to can say how we ought or ought not to live and how could we be brought to live we ought when our own nature is and always will be an incalculable mystery there is mistake about it nobody wants to think i not speak here of logical thinking that like any other natural function gives man great pleasure this reason philosophical systems however complicated arouse real and permanent interest in the public provided they only require from man the logical exercise of the mind and nothing else but to to this means relinquishing of logic it means living new life it means permanent sacriﬁce of the dearest habits tastes attachments without even the assurance that the sacriﬁce will bring any compensation artists and philosophers like to imagine the thinker with stern face profoun d look which penetrates into the unseen and noble eagle preparing ﬂight not at all thinking man is one who has lost his balance in the vulgar not in the tragic sense hands raking the air feet ﬂying face scared and bewildered he is caricature of helplessness and pitiable perplexity look at the aged turgenev his poems in prose and his letter to tolstoy maupa ssant thus tells of his meeting with turgenev there entered giant with silvery head quite so the majestic patriarch and master of course the myth of giants with silver locks is ﬁrmly established in the heart of man then suddenly enters turgenev in his prose poems pitiful ﬂuttering like bird that has been winged turgenev who has taught us can he be so ﬂuttered and bewildered how could he write his letter to tolstoy did he not know that tolstoy was ﬁnished the source of his creativ activity dried up that he must seek other activities of course he still he wrote that letter but it was not tolstoy nor even russian literature which of course is not kept going by the letters and covenants of its giants in the dreadful moments of the end turgenev in spite of his noble size and silver locks did not know what to say or where to look support and consolation so he turned to literature to which he had given his life he yearned that she whom he had served so long and loyally should just once help him save him from the horrible and thrice senseless nightmare he stretched out his withered numbing hands to the printed sheets which still preserve the traces of the soul of living suffering man he addressed his late enemy tolstoy with the most ﬂattering name great writer of the russian land recollected that he was his contemporary that he himself was great writer of the russian land but this he did not express aloud he only said i can he praised strict school of the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https general education to the last he tried to preserve his bearing of giant with silvery locks and we were gratiﬁed the same persons who are indignant at gogol correspondence quote turgenev letter with reverence the attitude is everything turgenev knew how to pose passably well and this is ascribed to him his greatest merit mundus vult decipi ergo decipiatur but gogol and turgenev felt substantially the same had turgenev burnt his own manuscripts and talked of himself instead of tolstoy before death he would have been accounted mad moralists would have reproached him his display of extreme egoism and philosophy philosophy seems to be getting rid of certain prejudices at the moment when men are least likely to play the hypocrite and lie to themselves turgenev and gogol placed their personal fate higher than the destinies of russian literature does not this betray secret to us ought we not to see in absolute egoism an inalienable and great yes very great quality of human nature psychology ignoring the threats of morality has led us to new knowledge yet still in spite of the instances we have given the mass of people will usual see nothing but malice in every attempt to reveal the human impulses that underlie lofty motives to be merely men seems humiliating to men so now malice will also be detected in my interpretation of turgenev letter matter what assurance i of fer to the contrary 3 on method certain naturalist made the following experiment glass jar was divided into two halves by perfectly transparent glass partition on the one side of the partition he placed pike on the other number of small ﬁshes such form the prey of the pike the pike did not notice the partition and hurled itself on its prey with of course the result only of bruised nose the same happened many times and always the same result at last seeing all its efforts ended so painfully the pike abandoned the hunt so that in few days when the partition had been removed it continued to swim about among the small fry without daring to attack them does not the same happen with us perhaps the limits between this world and the other world are also essentially of an experimental origin neither rooted in the nature of things was thought before kant or in the nature of our reason was thought after kant perhaps indeed partition does exist and make vain all attempts to cross over but perhaps there comes moment when the partition is removed in our minds however the conviction is ﬁrmly rooted that it is impossible to pass certain limits and painful to try conviction founded on experience but in this case we should recall the old scepticism of hume which idealist philosophy has regarded mere subtle valueless after kant critique the most lasting and varied experience can not lead to any binding and universal conclusion nay all our priori which are so useful certain time become sooner or later extremely harmful philosopher should not be afraid of scepticism but should go on bruising his jaw perhaps the failure of metaphysics lies in the caution and timidity of metaphysicians who seem ostensibly so brave they have sought they describe the highest boon whereas they should have value d more than anything restlessness aimlessness even purposelessness how can you tell when the partition will be removed perhaps at the very moment when man ceased his painful pursuit settled all his questions and rested on his laurels inert he could with one strong push have swept through the pernicious fence which separated him from the unknowable there is need man to move according to plan this is purely aesthetic demand which need not bind us let man senselessly and deliriously knock his head against the the wall go down at last will he value his triumph any the less unfortunately us the illusion has been established in us that plan and purpose are the best guarantee of success what delusion it is the opposite is true the best of all that genius has revealed to us has been revealed the result of fantas tic erratic apparently ridiculous and useless but relentlessly stubborn seeking columbus tired of sitting on the same spot sailed west to look india and genius in spite of vulgar conception is condition of chaos and unutterable restlessness not nothing has genius been counted kin to madness genius ﬂings itself hither and thither because it has not the sitzﬂeisch necessary industrious success in mediocrity we may be sure that earth has seen much more genius than history has recorded since genius is acknowled ged only when it has been serviceable when the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https has led to useful is the case in the majority of it arouses only feeling of disgust and abomination in all witnesses he ca rest and he ca let others rest if lermontov and dostoevsky had lived in times when there was demand books nobody would have noticed them lermontov early death would have passed unregretted perhaps some settled and virtuous citizen would have remarked weary of the young man eternal and dangerous freaks dog dog death the same of gogol tolstoy poushkin now they are praised because they left interesting books and so we need pay attenti on to the cry about the futility and worthlessness of scepticism even scepticism pure and unadulterated scepticism which has ulterior motive of clearing the way new creed to knock one head against the wall out of hatred the wall to beat against established and obstructive ideas because one detests them is it not an attractive proposition and then to see ahead uncertainly and limitless possibilities instead of ideals is not this too fascinating the highest good is rest i shall not argue gustibus aut nihil aut bene by the way is it superb principle and this superb principle has been arrived at perfectly by chance unfortunately not by but by one of the comical characters in tchekhov seagull he mixed up two latin proverbs and the result was splendid maxim which in order to become an priori awaits only universal acceptance 4 metaphysicians praise the transcende ntal and carefully avoid it nietzsche hated metaphysics he praised the bleib nur der erde treu meine bruder always lived in the realm of the transcendental of course the metaphysicians behave better this is indisputable he who would be teacher must proclaim the metaphysical point of view and he may become hero witho ut ever smelling powder in these anxious days when positivism seems to fall short one can not better than turn to metaphys ics then the young man need not any more envy alexander the macedonian with the assistance of few books not only earthly states are conquered but the whole mysterious universe metaphysics is the great art of swerving round dangerous experience so metaphysicians should be called the positivists par excellence they not despise all experience they assert but only the danger ous experiences they adapt the safest of all methods of selfdefence what the english call protective mimicry let us repeat to all professors know it already he who would be sincere metaphysician must avoid risky experience schiller once asked how can tragedy give delight the put it in our own if we are to obtain delight from tragedy it must be seen only upon the order to love the transcendental it also should be known only from the stage or from books of the philosophers this is called idealism the nicest word ever invented by philosophising men 5 poetae nascuntur onderful is man knowing nothing about it he asserts the existence of an objective impossibility even little while ago before the invention of the telephone and telegraph men would have declared it impossible europe to converse with america now it is possible we can not produce poets therefore we say they are born certainly we can not make child poet by forcing him to study literary models from the most ancient to the most modern neither will anybody hear us in america matter how loud we shout here to make poet of man he must not be developed along ordinary lines perhaps books should be kept from him perhaps it is necessary to perform some apparently dangerous operation on him fracture his skull or throw him out of window i will refrain from recommending these methods substitute paedagogy but that is not the point look at the great men and the poets except john stuart mill and couple of other positivist thinkers who had learned fathers and virtuous mothers none of the great men can boast of or better complain of proper upbringing in their lives nearly always the decisive part was played by accident accident which reason would dub meaninglessness if reason ever dared raise its voice against the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https something like broken skull or fall from the fourth metaphorically but often absolutely proved the commencement usually concealed but occasionally avowed of the activity of genius but we repeat automatically poetae nascuntur and are deeply convinced that this extraordinary truth is so lofty it needs veriﬁcation 6 until apollo calls him to the sacriﬁce ignobly the poet is plunged in the cares of this shoddy world silent is his lyre cold sleeps his soul of all the petty children of earth most petty it seems is he pisaryev the critic was exasperated by these verses presu mably if they had not belonged to poushkin all the critics along with pisaryev would have condemned them and their author to oblivion suspicious verse before apollo calls to poet is the most insigniﬁcant of mortals in his free hours the ordinary man ﬁnds some more or less distinguish ed distraction fox himself he hunts attends exhibitions of pictures or the theatre and ﬁnally rests in the bosom of his family but the poet is incapable of normal existence immediately he has ﬁnished with apollo forgetting all about altars and sacriﬁces he proceeds to occupy himself with unworthy objects or he abandons himself to the dolce far niente the customary pastime of all favourites of the muses let us here remark that not only all poets but all writers and artists in general are inclined to lead bad lives think what tolstoy tells us in confession and elsewhere of the best representatives of literature in the ﬁfties on the whole it is just poushkin says in his verses whilst he is engaged in composition an author is creature of some consequence apart from this he is nothing why are apollo and the muses so remiss why they draw to themselves wayward or vicious votaries instead of rewarding virtue we dare not suspect the gods even the dethroned of bad intentions apollo loved virtuous yet virtuous persons are evidently mediocre and unﬁt the sacred ofﬁces if any man is overcome with great desire to serve the god of song let him get rid of his virtues at once curious that this truth is so completely unknown to men they think that through virtue they can truly deserve the favour and choice of apollo and since industry is the ﬁrst virtue they peg away morning noon and night of course the more they work the less they which really puzzles and annoys them they even ﬂing aside the sacred arts and all the labours of devotee they give themselves up to idleness and other bad habits and sometimes it so happens that just man decides that it is all good the muses suddenly visit him so it was with dostoevsky and others schiller alone managed to get round apollo but perhaps it was only his biographers he got round germans are so trustful so easy to deceive the biographers saw nothing unusual in schiller habit of keeping his feet in cold water whilst he worked doubt they felt that if the divine poet had lived in the sahara where water is precious gold and the inspired can not take footbath every day then the speeches of the marquis of pola would have lacked half their nobleness at least and apparently schiller was not so wonderfully chaste if he needed such artiﬁcial resources in the composition of his ﬁne speeches in word we must believe poushkin poet is on the one hand among the elect on the other hand he is one of the most insigniﬁcant of mortals hence we can draw very consoling conclusion the most insigniﬁcan t of men are not altogether so worthless we imagine they may not be ﬁt to occupy government positions or professorial chairs but they are often extremely at home on parnassus and such high places apollo rewards vice and virtue everybody knows is so satisﬁed with herself she needs reward then why the pessimists lament leibnitz was quite right we live in the best possible of worlds i would even suggest that we leave out the modiﬁcation possible 7 it is ewig weibliche with russian writers poushkin and lermontov loved women and were not afraid of them poushkin who trusted his own nature was often in love and always sang his love of the momen when infatuated with bacchante he the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https when he married he warbled of modest beauty his wife synthesising mind would probably not know what to with all poushkin sorts of love nor is lermontov any better he abused women but byelinsky observed after meeting him he loved women more than anything in the world and again not women of one mould only any and all attractive females the wild bella the lovely mary thamar one and all matter of what race or condition every time lermontov is in love he assures us his love is so deep and ardent and even moral that we can not judge him without conpunction vladimir solovi ov alone was not afraid to condemn him he brought poushkin well lermontov to account their moral irregularities and he even went so far to say that it was not he himself who judged them but fate in whose service he acted public denouncer lermontov and poushkin both dying young had deserved death their frivolities but there was nobody else besides vladimir soloviov to darken the memories of the two poets it is true tolstoy can not forgive poushkin dissolute life but he does not apply to fate verdict according to tolstoy morality can cope even with titan like poushk in in tolstoy view morality grows stronger the harder the job it has to tackle it pardons the weak offenders without waste of words but it never forgives pride and if tolstoy edicts had been executed all memorials to poushkin would have disap peared chieﬂy because of the poet addiction to the eternal female in such case tolstoy is implacable he admits the the kind of love whose object is the establishing of family but more don juan is hateful transgressor think of levin and his attitude to prostitutes he is exasperated indignant even forgets the need compassion and calls them beasts in the eternal female tolstoy sees temptation seduction sin great danger therefore it is necessary to keep quite away from the danger but surely danger is the dragon which guards every treasure on earth and again matter what his precautions man will meet his fate sooner or later and come into conﬂict with the dragon surely this is an axiom poushkin and lermontov loved danger and therefore sought women they paid heavy price but while they lived they lived freely and lightly if they had cared to peep in the book of destinies they might have averted or avoided their sad end but they preferred to trust their or unlucky tolstoy was the ﬁrst among can not speak of gogol began to fear life he was the ﬁrst to start open moralising in so far public opinion and personal dignity demand it he did go to meet his dangers but not step further so he avoided women art and philosophy love per that is love which does not lead to family like wisdom per which is wisdom that has utilitarian motive and like art art sake seemed to him the worst of temptations leading to the destruction of the soul when he plunged too deep in thinking he was seized with panic it seemed to i was going mad so i went away to the bashkirs koumiss such confessions are common in his works and surely there is other way with temptations than to cut short at once before it is too late tolstoy preserved himself on account of his inborn instinct departing betimes from dangerous situation save this cautious prompting he would probably have ended like lermontov or poushkin true he might have gone deeper into nature and revealed us rare secrets instead of preaching at us abstinence humility simplicity and so on but such luck fell to the fate of dostoevsky dostoevsky had very muddled relations with morality he was too racked by disease and circumstance to get much proﬁt out of the rules of morality the hygiene of the soul like that of the body is beneﬁcial only to healthy men to the sick it is simply harmful the more dostoevsky engaged himself with high morality the more inextricably entangled he became he wanted to respect the personality in woman and only the personality and so he came to the point where he could not look on any woman however ugly with indifference the elder karamazov and his affair with elizabeth smerdyascha stinking lizzie what other imagination could such union have been contemplated dostoevsky of course reprimands karamazov and thanks to the standards of modern criticism such reprimand is accounted sufﬁcient to exonerate our author but there are other standards if writer sets out to tell you that drab could be so loathsome that her ugliness would make you forget she was woman and if illustration of this novel idea we are told the history of fiodov karam azov with the deformed repulsive idiot stinking lizzie then in face of such imaginative art it is surely out of place to preserve the usual conﬁdence in that writer we not speak of the interest and appreciation the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https tastes and ideas not one moment will i assert that those who with poushkin and lermontov can see the eternal female only in young and charming women have any advantage over dost oevsky of course we are not forbidden to live according to our tastes and we may like tolstoy call certain women beasts but who has given us the right to assert that we are higher or better than dostoevsky judging objectively all the points go to show that dostoevsky is any rate he saw further deeper he could ﬁnd an original interest he could discover ewig weibliche where we should see nothing of attraction at all where goethe would avert his face stinking lizzie is not beast levin would say but woman who is able if even moment to arouse feeling of love in man and we thought she was worse than nothing since she roused in us only disgust dostoevsky made discovery we with our reﬁned feelings missed it his distorted abnormal sense showed greater sensitiveness in which our high morality was deﬁcient and the road to the great truth this time ever is through deformity idealists will not agree they are quite justly afraid that one may not reach the truth but may get stuck in the mud idealists are careful men and not nearly so stupid their ideals would lead us to suppose 8 new ideas even our own not quickly conquer our sympathies we must ﬁrst get accustomed to them 9 point of writer every educated person thinks it necessary to have permanent point of view he climbs up some elevation and never climbs down again all his days whatever he sees from this point of view he believes to be reality truth justice what he does not see he excludes from existence man is not much to blame this surely there is very great joy in moving from point of view to point of view shifting one camp from peak to peak we have wings and winged thought is only nice s of course it refers to logical thinking there to be sure great volatility is usual lightness which comes from perfect naïveté if not ignorance he who really wishes to know something and not merely to have philosophy does not rely on logic and is not allured by reason he must clamber from summit to summit and if necessary hibernate in the dales wide horizon leads to illusions and in order to familiarise oneself with any object it is essential to go close up to it touch it feel it examine it from top to bottom and on every side one must be ready should this be impossible otherwise to sacriﬁce the customary position of the body to wriggle to lie ﬂat to stand on one head in word to assume the most unnatural of attitudes can there be any question of permanent point of view the more mobility and elasticity man has the less he values the ordinary equilibrium of his body the oftener he changes his outlook the more he will take in if on the other hand he imagines that from this or the other pinnacle he has the most comfortable survey of the world and life leave him alone he will never know anything nay he does not want to know he cares more about his personal convenience than about the quality of his work doubt he will attain to fame and success and thus brilliantly justify his point of view 10 fame thread from everyone and the naked will have shirt there is beggar but has his thread of cotton and he will not grudge it to naked nor even to fully dressed one but will bestow it on the ﬁrst comer the poor who want to forget their poverty are very ready with their threads moreover they prefer to give them to the rich rather than to to load the rich with beneﬁts must not one be very rich indeed that is why fame is so easily got an ambitious person asks admir ation and respect from the crowd and is rarely denied the mob feel that their throats are the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https and their arms are strong why not vociferate and clap seeing that you can turn the head not only of beggar like yourself but of future hero god knows how almighty person the humiliated citizen who has hitherto been hauled off to the police station if he shouted suddenly feels that his throat has acquired new value never before has anyone given rap his worthless opinion and now seven cities are ready to quarrel it the right to claim homer the citize n is delighted he shouts at the top of his voice and is ready to throw all his possessions after his shouts so the hero is satisﬁed the greater the shout the deeper his belief in himself and his mission what will hero not believe he forgets so soon the elements of which his fame and riches are made heroes usually are convinced that they set out on their noble career not to beg shouts from beggars but to heap blessings on mankind if they could only call to mind with what beating hearts they awaited their ﬁrst applause their ﬁrst alms how timidly they curried favour with ragged beggars perhaps they would speak less assuredly of their own merits but our memory is fully acquainted with herbert spencer and his law of adaptability and thus many worthy man goes gaily on in full belief in his own stupendous virtue 11 in defence of righteousness and ingenuous people see in righteousness merely burden which lofty people have assumed out of respect law or some other high and inexplicable reason but righteous man has not only duties but rights true sometimes when the law is against him he has to compromise yet how rarely does the law desert him cruelty matters in him so long he does not infringe the statutes nay he will ascribe his cruelty merit to himself since he acts out of personal considerations but in the name of sacred justice matter what he may once he is sanctioned he sees in his actions only merit merit merit modesty forbids him to say too if he were to let go what luxurious panegyric he might deliver to himself remembering his works he praises himself at all times not aloud but inwardly the nature of virtue demands it man must rejoice in his morality and ever keep it in mind and after that people declare that it is hard to be righteous whatever the other virtues may be certainly righteousness has its selﬁsh side rule it is decide dly worth while to make considerable sacriﬁces in order later on to enjoy in calm conﬁdence all that surety and those rights bestowed on man by morality and public approval look at german who has paid his contribution to society the assistance of the indigent not one stray farthing will he give not to poor wretch who is starving before his eyes and in this he feels right this is righteousness out and out pay your tax and enjoy the privileges of man so righteousness is much in vogue with cultured commercial nations russians have not quite got there they are afraid of the exactions of righteousness not guessing the enormous advantages derived russian has permanent relationship with his conscience which costs him far more than the most moral german or even englishman has to pay his righteousness 12 the best way of getting rid of tedious truths is to stop paying them the tribute of respect and to treat them with touch of easy familiarity and derision to put into brackets dostoevsky did such words good progress and so on will alone achieve you much more than many brilliant arguments would whils t you still contest certain truth you still believe in it and this even the least penetrating individual will perceive but if you favour it with serious attention and only throw out scornful remark now and then the result is different it is evident you have ceased to be afraid of the old truth you longer respect it and this sets people thinking the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https walls philosophy is being an thinker is busy deciding on everything that is taking place in the world the state of the world market the existence of wireless telegraphy and the life after death the cave dweller and the perfectibility of man and so on and so on his chief business is so to select his statements that there shall be internal contradiction and this will give an appearance of truth such work which is quite amusing and even interesting leads at last to very poor results surely verisimilitu des of truth are not truth nor have necessarily anything in common with truth again man who undertakes to talk of everything probably knows nothing thus swan can ﬂy and walk and swim but it ﬂies indifferently walks badly and swims poorly an philosopher enclose d by four walls sees nothing but those four walls and yet of these precisely he does not choose to speak if by accident he suddenly realised them and spoke of them his philosophy might acquire an enormous value this may happen when study is converted into prison the same four walls but impossible not to think of them whatever the prisoner turns his mind the wars the future the bygone geological the four walls enclose it all the calm of the study supplanted by the pathos of imprisonment the prisoner has more contact with the world and less but now he longer slumbers and has grayish dreams called he is wide awake and strenuously living his philosophy is worth hearing but man is not distinguished his powers of discrimi nation he sees solitude and four walls and says study he dreams of the where there is noise and jostling physic al bustle and decides that there alone life is to be met he is wrong usual in the among the crowd not men sleep their deadest sleep and is not the keenes t spiritual activity taking place in seclusion 14 the spartans made their helots drunk an example and warning to their noble youths good method doubt but what are we of the twentieth century to whom shall we make drunk we have slaves so we have instituted higher literature novels and stories describe drunken dissolute men and paint them in such horrid colours that every reader feels all his desire vice depar t from him unfortunately only our russians are either too conscientious or not sufﬁciently rectilinear in their minds instead of showing the drunken helot an object of repug nance the spartans did they try to describe vice truthfully realism has taken hold indeed why make fuss what does it matter if the writer description is little more or less ugly than the event was justice invented that everything even evil should be kept intact surely evil must be simply rooted out banned placed outside the pale the spartans did not stand on ceremony with living men and yet our novelists are afraid of being unjust to imaginary drunken helots and so to speak out of humane feeling too how naive one must be to accept such justiﬁcation yet everybody accepts it tolstoy alone towards the end guessed that humanita rianism is only pretext in this case and that we russians have described vice not only the purpose of scaring our readers in modern masters the word vice arouses not disgust but insatiable curiosity perhaps the wicked thing has been persecuted in vain like so many other good things perhaps it should have been studied perhaps it held mysteries on the strength of this perhaps morality was gradually abandoned and tolstoy remained almost alone in his indignation realism reigns and drunken helot arouses envy in timid readers who not know where to put their trust whether in the traditional rules or in the appeal of the master drunken helot an ideal what have we come to were it not better to have stuck to l ycurgus have we not paid too dearly our progress many people think we have paid too to mention tolstoy who is now longer taken quite seriously though still accounted great man any mediocre journalist enjoys greater inﬂuence than this of the russian land it is inevitable tolstoy insists on thinking about things which are nobody concern he has long since abandoned this does he continue to exist in any other difﬁcult question tolstoy writes books and letters therefore he exists this inference once so convincing now has hardly any effect on us particularly if we take into accou nt what the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https that tolstoy writes in several of his last letters he expresses opinions which surely have meaning an ordinary man they can be summed up in few words tolstoy professes an extreme egoism sollipsism that is in his old age after inﬁnite attempts to love his neighbour he comes to the conclusion that not only is it impossible to love one neighbour but that there is neighbour that in all the world tolstoy alone exists that there is even world but only tolstoy view so obviously absurd that it is not worth refuting by the way there is also possibility of refuting it unless you admit that logical inferences are sollipsism dogged tolstoy already in early youth but at that time he did not know what to with the impertinent oppressive idea so he ignored it finally he came to it the older man becomes the more he learns how to make use of impertinent ideas fairly recently tolstoy could pronounce such dictum christ taught men not to stupid things who but tolstoy could have ventured on such an interpretation of the gospels why have we all of us but these words contained the greatest blasphemy on christ and his teaching but it was tolstoy last desperate attempt to save himself from sollipsism without at the same time ﬂying in the face of logic even christ appeared among men only to teach them common sense whence follows that mad thoughts may be rejected with an easy conscience and the advantage usual remains with the wholesome reasonable sensible thoughts there is room good and reason good is understood it need not be explained if only good existed in the world there would exist questions neither simple nor ultimate this is why youth never questio ns what indeed should it question the song of the nightingale the morning of may happy laughter all the predicates of youth these need interpretation on the contrary any explanation is reduced to these the proper questions arise only on contact with evil hawk struck nightingale ﬂowers withered boreas froze laughing in terror our questions arose that is evil the ancients were right not in vain is our earth called vale of tears and sorrow and once questions are started it is impossible and unseemly to hurry the answers still less anticipate the questions the nightingale is dead and will sing longer the listener is frozen to death and can hear more songs the situation is so palpably absurd that only with the intention of getting rid of the question at any cost will one strive sensible answer the answer must be you want it question but if you must question then be ready beforehand to reconcile yourself with something like sollipsism or moder n realism thought is in dilemma and dare not take the leap to get out we laugh at philosophy and long possible avoid evil but nearly all men feel the intolerable cramp of such situation and each at his risk ventures to swim to shore on some more or less witty theory few courageous ones speak the they are neither understood nor respected when man words show the depth of the pain through which he has passed he is not indeed condemned but the world begins to talk of his tragic state of soul and to take on mournful look ﬁtting to the occasion others more scrupulous feel that phrases and mournful looks are unﬁtting yet they can not dwell at length on the tragedies of outsiders so they take on an exaggeratedly stern bearing if to say we feel deeply but we not wish to show our feeling they really feel nothing only want to make others believe how sensitive and modest they are at times this leads to curious results even in writers of the ﬁrst order of renown thus anatole france the inventor of that most charming smile which is intended to convince men that he feels everything and understands everything but does not cry out because that would not be ﬁtting in one of his novels takes upon himself the noble rôle of advocate of the victims of crime against the criminal our time he says out of pity to the criminal forgets the sufferings of his victim this i repeat is one of the most curious misrepresentations of modern endeavour it is true we in russia talk good deal about compassion particularly to criminals and anatole france is by means the only man who thinks that our distinguishing characteristic is extreme sensitive ness and tender but matter of fact the modern man who thinks himself is not drawn to the criminal by sense of compassion which would incontestably be better applied to the victim but by curiosity or if you like inquisitiveness thousands of years man has sought to solve the great mystery of life through theodicy and metaphysical theories result both of which deny the possibility of mystery theodicy has long ago wearied us the mechanistic theories which contend the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https is nothing special in life that its appearance and disappearance depend on the same laws those of the conservation of energy and the indestructibility of matter these look more plausible at ﬁrst sight but people not take to them and theory can survive men reluctance to believe in it in word good has not justiﬁed the expectations placed on it reason has done better so overwrought mankind has turned from its old idols and enthroned madness and evil the smiling anatole argues and excellently but who does not know what his proofs amount to who wants them it may be our children will take fright at the task we have undertaken will call us squandering parents and will set themselves again to heaping up treasures spiritual and material again they will believe in ideals progress and such like my own part i have hardly any doubt of it sollipsism and the cult of groundlessness are not lasting and most of all they are not to be handed down the ﬁnal triumph in life in old comedies rests with goodness and common sense history has known many epochs like ours and gone through with them degeneration follows on the heels of immoderate curiosity and sweeps away all reﬁned and exaggerately individuals men of genius have their children are idiots not nothing is nature so majestically serene she has hidden her secrets well enough which is not surprising considering how unscrupulous she is despot not the greatest villain on earth has ever wielded power with the cruelty and heartlessness of nature the least violation of her the severest punishment follows disease deformity madness death has not our common mother contrived to keep us in subjection true certain optimists think that nature does not punish us but educates us so tolstoy sees it death and sufferings like animated scarecrows boo at man and drive him into the one way of life open to him life is subject to its own law of reason not bad method of upbringing exactly like using wolves and bears unfortunate man bolting from one booing monster is not always able in time to dodge into the one correct way and dashes straight into the maw of another beast of prey then what and this often happens without disparagement of the optimists we may say that sooner or later it happens to every man after which more running you wo tear yourself out of the claws of madness or disease only one thing is left in spite of traditions theodicy wiseacres and most of all in spite of oneself to go on praising mother nature and her great goodness let future generations reject us let history stigmatise our names the names of traitors to the human we will compose hymns to deformity destruction madness chaos darkness and after the grass grow 15 astrology and alchemy lived their day and died natural death but they left posterity inventing dyes and astronomy accumulating formulae so it is geniuses beget idiots especially when the mothers are very virtuous in this case when their virtue is extraordinary the mothers are public utility and morality the alchemists wasted their time seeking the philosopher stone the astrologers swindled people telling fortunes by the stars wedded to utility these two fathers have begotten the chemists and astronomers nobody will dispute the genealogy perhaps even none will dispute that from idiotic children one may with measure of probability infer genius in the parents there are certain indications that this is of course one may not go beyond supposition but supposition is enough there are more arguments in store instance day is so convinced of the absolute nonsense and uselessness of alchemy and astrology that one dreams of verifying the conviction we know there were many charlatans and liars amongst alchemists and astrologers but what does this prove in every department there are the same mediocre creatures who speculate on human credulity however positive our science of medicine is there are many fraudulen t doctors who rob their patients the alchemists and astrologers were in all probability the most remarkable men of their time i will go further in spite of fs and formu lae even in our nineteenth century which was so famous its inventions and discoveries the most eminent talented men still sought the philosopher stone and forecast the destinies of man and those among them who were possessed of poetic gift won universal attention in the old days consensu sapientium poet was allowed all kinds of the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https might speak of fate miracles spirits the life of anything provided he was interesting that was enough the nineteenth century paid its tribute to restlessness never were there so many disturbing throbbing writers during the epoch of telephones and telegraphs it was held indecent to speak in plain language of the vexed and troubled aspirations of the human spirit those guilty of the indecency were even dosed with bromides and treated with shower and concentrated foods but all this is external it belongs to history of fashions and can not interest us here the point is that alchemy and astrology did not die they only shammed death and left the stage time now apparently they are tired of seclusion and are coming forward again having pushed their unsuccessful children into the background well so be it la bonne heur 16 man comes to the pass where all experie nce seems exhausted wherever he go whatever he see all is old and wearyingly familiar most people explain this by saying that they really know everything and that from what they have experienced they can infer all experience this phase of the exhaustion of life usually comes to man between ﬁve and best period according to karamzin not seeing anything new the individual assumes he is completely matured and has the right to judge of everything knowing what has been he can forecast what will be but karamzin was mistak en about the best period and the mature people are mistaken about the nothing new can happen the fact of spiritual stagnation should not be made the ground judging all life possibilities from known possibilities on the contrary such stagnatio n should prove that however rich and multifariou s the past may have been it has not exhausted tittle of the whole possibilities from that which has been it is impossible to infer what will be moreover it is perhaps to give us sense of our full maturity and let us enjoy all the charms of the best period of life so eloquently described by karamzin the temptation is not overwhelming so that if man is under the necessity of enduring period of arrest and stagnation and until such time life is doomed to meditation would it not be better to use this meditating interr egnum directly opposite purpose from the one indicated that is to say the purpose of ﬁnding in our past signs which tell us that the future has every right to be anything whatsoever like or utterly unlike the past such signs given good will to ﬁnd them may be seen in plenty at times one comes to the concl usion that the natural connection of phenomena hitherto observed is not at all inevitable the future and that miracles which so far have seemed impossible may come to seem possible even natural far more natural than that loathsome law of sequence the law of the regularity of phenomena we are bored stiff with regularity and it you also you men of science at the mere thought that however we may think we can get further than the acknowledgment of the old regularity an invincible disgus t to any kind of mental work overcomes us to discover another hen already we have far more than we can with surely if there is any left in us it is established in the supposition that the mind can not and must not have any bounds any limits and that the theory of knowledge which is based on the history of knowledge and on few very doubtful assumptions is only piece of property belonging to certain caste and has nothing to with us others die natur zuletzt sich doch ergründe what mad impatience seizes us at times when we realise that we shall never fathom the great myste ry every individual in the world must have felt at one time the mad desire to unriddle the universe even the stodgy philosophers who inven ted the theory of knowledge have at times made surreptitious sorties hoping to open path to the unknown in spite of their own fat senseless books that demonstrate the advantages of scientiﬁc knowledge man either lives in continuous experience or he frees himself from conclusions imposed by limited experience all the rest is the devil from the devil come the blandishments with which karamzin charmed himself and his readers or is it the contrary who will answer once again usual at the end of pathetic speech one is left with conjecture let every man please himself but what about those who would like to live according to karamzin but can not i can not speak them schiller recommended hope will it to be frank hardly he who has once lost his peace of mind will never ﬁnd it the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https ever since kant succeeded in convinc ing the learned that the world of phenomena is quite other than the world of true reality and that even our own existence is not our real existence but only the visible manif estation of mysterious unknown substance substantia has been stuck in new rut and can not move single millimetre out of the track laid out by the great königsber gian backward or forward it can go but necessarily in the kantian rut how can you get out of the counterposing of the phenomenon against the this proposition this counterposi ng seems inalterable so there is nothing left but to stick your head in the heavy of the theory of knowledge which most philosophers even with glad smile which inevitably rouses suspicion that they have got what they wanted and their metaphysical need was nothing more than need harness otherwise they would have kicked at the sight of the collar surely the contraposition between the world of phenomena and the is an invention of the reasoning mind is the theory of knowledge deduced from this contraposing therefore the spirit could reject it in the very basta with the devil one must be very cautious we know quite well that if he only gets hold of the tip of your ear he will carry off your whole body so it is with reason grant it one single assumption admit but one ﬁnita la commedia you are in the toils metaphysics canno t exist with reason everything metaphysical is absurd everything reasonable positive so we come upon dilemma the fundamental predicate of metaphysics is absurdity and yet surely many positive assertions can lay legitimate claim to that same predicate what then is there means of distinguishing metaphysical absurdity from perfectly ordinary one may one have recourse to criteria will not the very criterion prove pitfal l wherein cunning reason will catch the poor man who was rushing out to freedom there can be two answers to this question all services rendered by reason must be paid sooner or later at the exorbitant price of whether you accept the assistance in the noble form of the theory of knowledge or merely humble criterion at last you will be driven forth into the streets of positivism this happens all the time to young inexperienced minds they break the bridle and dash forward into space to ﬁnd themselves rushing into the same old rome whither we know all roads lead or to use more lofty language rushing into the stable whither also all roads lead the only way to guard against granting of course that positivism longer attracts your to cease to fear any absurdities whether rational or metaphysical and systematically to reject all the services of reason such behaviour has been known in philosophy and i make bold to recommend it credo quia absur dum comes from the middle ages modern instances are nietzsche and schopenhauer both present noble examples of indifference to logic and particularly schopenhauer who kantian even in the name of kant made such daring sallies against reason driving her into confusion and shame that astounding kantian even went so far in the master name still to attempt the overthrow of the space and time notions he admitted to this day the learned are bothered whether to class that admission among the metaphysic al or the ordinary absurdities really i ca advise them very clever man insists on an enormous absurdity so i am satisﬁed schopenhauer whole campaign against intellect is very comforting it is evident that though he set out from the kantian stable he soon got sick of hauling along down the and having broken the shafts he trotted jauntily into jungle of irreconcilable contradictions without reﬂecting in the least where he was making the primate of will over reason and music the expression of our deepest essence are not these assertions sufﬁci ent to show us how dexterously he wriggled out from the harness of synthetic judgments priori which kant had placed upon every thinker there is indeed much more music than logic in the philosophy of schopenhauer not nothing is he excluded from the universities but of course one may speak of him in the open not of his ideas naturally but of his music the european market is glutted with ideas how neat and d and logically those ideas are schopenhauer had such goods but what lively and splendid contradictions he boldly spreads on his stall often even without suspicion that he ought to hide them from the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https schopenhauer cries and laughs and gets furious or glad without ever realising that this is forbidden to philosopher not speak but sing said zarathustra and schopenhauer ready fulﬁlled the command in great measure philosophy may be though it does follow that music may be called philosophy when man has done his work and gives himself up to looking and listening and pleasantly accepting everything hiding nothing from himself then he begins to philosophise what good are abstract formulae to him why should he ask himself before he begins to think what can i think about what are the limits of thoug ht he will think and those who like can the summing up and the building of theories of knowledge what is the earthly use of talking about beauty beautiful things must be created not one single aesthetic theory has so far been able to guess what direction the artists mind will next take or what are the limits to his creative activity the same with the theory of knowledge it may arrest the work of man of learning if he be himself afraid that he is going too far but it is powerless to determine human thought even kant counterposing of to the world of phenomena can not ﬁnally clip the wings of human curiosity there will come time when this unshakeable foundation of positivism will be shaken all gnosiological disputes to what thought can or can not achieve will seem to our posterity just amusing the disputes of the schoolmen seem to us why did they argue about the nature of truth when they might have gone out and looked truth itself the future historians will ask let us have an answer ready them our contemporaries not want to go out and seek so they make great deal of talk about theory of knowledge 18 trust not thyself young dreamer sincerely you may long truth whatever sufferings and horrors you may have surpassed not believe your own self

to him he has discovered new almighty truth which he must make haste to impart to forlorn mankind later becoming more modest he begins to doubt his truths and then he writes to convince himself few more years go by and he knows he was mistaken all round so there is need to convince himself nevertheless he continues to write because he is not ﬁt any other work and to be accounted superﬂuous man is so horrible 20 very original man is often banal writer and vice versa we tend so often to write not about what is going on in us but of our pia desideria thus restless sleepless men sing the glory of sleep and rest which have long been sung to death and those who sleep the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https on end and are always up to the mark must perforce dream about adventures and storms and dangers and even extol everything problematical 21 when one reads the books of men strange sensation comes over one these men who lived two hundred three hundred three thousand years ago are so far off now from this writing which they have left on earth yet we look eternal truths in their works 22 the truth which i have the right to announce so solemnly even to the ﬁrst among men will probably be stale old lie on my lips so i will deprive myself of the right of calling such truth my own probably i shall deprive one but myself others will go on loving and

forgive man his convictions however unwillingly it goes without saying that we balk at any individual who believes in his own infallibility but one must reconcile oneself with necessity it is ugly and preposterous to have corns on one hands but still they ca be avoided in this unparadisal earth of sweat and labour but why see an ideal in callosities in practical life particularly in the social political life to which we are doomed convictions are necessity unity is strength and unity is possible only among people who think alike again deep conviction is in itself strong force far more powerful than the most logical argumentation somet imes one has only to pronounce in full round vibrating chest voice such is peculiar to people of conviction some triﬂing sentence and an audience hitherto unconvinced is carried away truth is often dumb particularly new truth which is most shy of people and which has feeble hoarse voice but in certain situations that which will inﬂuence the crowd is more important than that which is genuine truth convictions are necessary to the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https man but he who is too clever to believe in himself entirely and is not enough of an actor to look if he believed he had best give up public work altogether at the same time he will realise that lack of convic tions is not proﬁtable and will look with more indulgence on such are bound to keep themselves well supplied yet all the more will he dislike those men who without any necessity disﬁgure themselves with the coarse tattoo marks and particularly he will object to such women what can be more intolerable than woman of conviction she lives in family without having to grind her daily disﬁgure herself why wilfully rub her hands into corns when she might keep them clean and pretty women moreover usually pick up their convictions from the man who interests them most at the moment and never they this so vigorously when the man himself seems incapable of paving the way to his ideas they are full of feeling him they rush to the last extremities of resource will not their feeble little ﬁsts help him it may be touching but in the end it is intolerable so it is much pleasanter to meet woman who believes in her husband and does not consider it necessary to help him she can then dispense with convictions 28 emancipation of women one and only way of mastering an enemy is to learn the use of his weapons starting from this modern woman weary of being the slave of man tries to learn all his tricks hard is slavery wonderful is freedom slavery at last is so unendurable that human being will sacriﬁce everything freedom of what use are his virtues to prisoner languishing in prison he has one aim one get out of prison and he values only such qualities in himself will assist his escape if it is necessary to break an iron grating by physical force then strong muscles will seem to the prisoner the most desirable of all things if cunning will help him cunning is the ﬁnest thing on earth something the same happens with woman she became convinced that man owed his priority chieﬂy to education and trained mind so she threw herself on books and universities learning that promises freedom is light everything else darkness of course it is delusion but you could never convince her of it that would mean the collapse of her best hopes of freed om so that in the end woman will be informed man she will furnish herself with broad views and unshakeable convictions with philosophy in the end she may even learn to think logically then probably the many misunderstandings between the sexes will cease but heavens how tedious it will be men will argue wome n will argue children will probably be born fully instructed understanding everything with what pain will the men of the future view our women capricious frivolous uninformed creatures understanding nothing and desiring to understand nothing whole half of the human race neither would nor could have any understanding but the hope lies there maybe we can without understanding perhaps logical mind is not an attribute but curse in the struggle existence however and the survival of the ﬁttest not few of the best human qualities have perished obviously woman illogicality is also destined to disappear it is thousand pities 29 all kinds of literature are good except the tedious said voltaire we may enlarge the idea all men and all activities are good except the tedious whatever your failings and your vices if you are only amusing or interesting all is forgiven you accordingly frankness and naturalness are quite rightly considered doubtful virtues if people say that frankness and naturalness are virtues always take it cum grano salis sometimes it is permissible and even opportune to ﬁre off truth of all sorts sometimes one may stretch oneself like log across the road but god forbid that such sincere practices should be raised into principle to out with the truth at all times always to reveal oneself entirely besides being impossible to accomplish never having been accomplished even in the confessions of the greatest men is moreover far more risky business than it seems i can conﬁdently assert that if any man tried to tell the whole truth about himself not metaphorically every metaphor is covering ornament but in plain bare words the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https would ruin himself ever he would lose all interest in the eyes of his neighbours and even in his own eyes each of us bears in his soul heavy wound and knows it yet carries himself must carry himself if he were aware of nothing while all around keep up the pretence remember lermontov look ar ound you playfully the cr owd moves on the usual r oad scarce mark of tr ouble on the festive faces not one indecent tear and yet is bar ely one amongst them but is crushed by heavy tortur or has gather ed the wrinkles of young age save fr om crime or loss these words are horribly the really horrible should be concealed it frightens one off i admit byron and lermontov could make it alluring but all that is alluring depends on vagueness remoteness any monster may be beautiful in the distanc and man can be interesting unless he keep certain distance between himself and people women not understand this if they like man they try to come utterly near to him and are surprised that he does not meet their frankness with frankness and admit them to his holy of holies but in the innermost sanctuary the only beauty is inaccessib ility rule it is not sanctuary but lair where the wounded beast in man has run to lick his wounds and shall this be done in public people generally and women particularly ought to be given something positive in books one may still sing the praise of wounds hopelessness and you like books are still literature conventionality but to strip one anguish in the open market to confess an incurable disease to others this is to kill one soul not to relieve it all even the best men have some aversion you perhaps in the interest of order and decorum they will grant you place in their philosophy of life in philosophy of life in cemetery place is prepared each and all and everyone is welcome there also are enclosures where rubbish is dumped to rot but those who have yet desire to be ﬁtted into i would advise them to keep their tongue between their teeth or like nietzsche and dostoevsky take to literature to writer in books and only in books all is permitted provided he has talent but in actual living even writer must not let loose too much lest people should guess that in his books he is telling the truth 30 poushkin asserts that the poet himself can and must be the judge of his own work are you content exacting artist content then let the mob revile it is needless to argue against this how could you prove that the supreme verdict belongs not to the poet himself but to public opinion nor that matter can we prove poushkin right we must agree or disagree we like but we can not reject the evidence whether you like it or not poushkin was evidently satisﬁed with his own work and did not need his reader sanction happy man and it seems to he owed his happiness exclusively to his inability to pass beyond certain limits i all poets would agree to repeat poushkin verse quoted above i decidedly refuse to believe that shakespeare instance after ﬁnishing hamlet or king lear could have said to himself i who judge my work more strictly than any other can judge am satisﬁed i not think he can even have thought moment of the merits of his works hamlet or king lear to shakespeare after hamlet the word satisﬁed must have lost all its meaning and if he used it it was only by force of habit we sometimes call to dead person his own works must have seemed to him imperfect mean pitiful like the sob of child or the moaning of sick man he gave them to the theatre and most probably was surprised that they had any success perhaps he was glad that his tears were of some use if only amusing and instructing people and probably in this sense the verdict of the crowd was dearer to him than his own verdict he could not help accusing his own heaven other people acquitted it true they acquitted it because they did not understand or understood imperfectly but this did not matter use every man after his desert the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https should whipping asked hamlet shakespeare knew that strict tribunal would reject his works they contain so many terrible questions and not one perfect answer could anyone be satisﬁed at that rate perhaps with comedy of errors twelfth night or even richar d after hamlet man may ﬁnd rest only in his grave to speak the whole truth i doubt if poush kin himself maintained the view we have quoted till the end of his days or even if he spoke all he felt when he wrote the poem in possibly he felt how little poet can be satisﬁed with his work but pride prevented his admitting it and he tried to console himself with his superiority over the crowd which is undeniably right thing to poushkin had to endure answered with contempt and woe to the poor wretch who feels impelled to justify his contempt by his own merits according to the stern voice of conscience such niceness is dangerous and unnecessary if man would preserve his strength and his conﬁdence he must give up magnanimity he must learn to despise people and even if he can not despise them he must have the air of one who would not give pin head anybody he must appear always content poushkin was clever man and deep nature 31 metaphysics against their often occurs to us that evil is not altogether so unnecessary after all diseases humiliations miseries deformity failure and all the rest of those plants which ﬂourish with such truly tropical luxuriance on our planet are probably essential to man poets sing plentifully of sorrow nous sommes les apprentis la douleur est notre maîtr said musset on this subject everybody can bring forth quotation not only from the philosophers who are cold heartless tribe but from tender gentle or sentimental poets doubtless one knows many instances where suffering has proﬁted man true also one knows many cases of the direct

when suddenly horrible disease stole upon him not killing him but taking him between its loathsome jaws but what then tchekhov girls and women they are mostly young innocent fascinating and always there lies in wait them round every corner meaningless rude ugly misery which murders even the most modest hopes they sob bitterly but fate takes notice how explain such horrors tchekhov is silent he does not weep left off long ago and besides it is humiliating thing person to setting one teeth it is necessary either to keep silent explain well metaphysics under takes the explanation where common sense stops metaphysics must take another stride we have seen it says many instances where at ﬁrst glance suffering seemed absurd and needless but where later on profound signiﬁcance was revealed thus it may be that what we can not explain may ﬁnd its explanation in time is lost cries uncle vanya is done repeat the voices of girls innocently nothing is lost the very horror which drowning man experiences goes to show that the drowning is nothing ﬁnal it is only the beginning of greater events the less man has fulﬁlled in experience the more in him remains of unsatisﬁed passion and desire the greater are the grounds thinking that his essence can not be destroyed but must manifest itself somehow or other in the universe voluntary asceticism and such common human phenomena help to solve the riddle nobody compels man he imposes suffering and abstinence on himself it is an incomprehensible instinct but still an instinct which rooted in the depths of our nature prompts us to decision repugnant to reason renounce life save yourself the majority of men not hear or not heed the prompting and then nature which can not rely on our sensibility has recourse to violence she shows glimpses of paradise to us in our youth awakens hopes and impossible desires and at the moment of our supreme expectation she shows us the hollownes s of our hope nearly every life can be summed up in few words man was shown thrown into the mud we are all the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https or involuntary here on earth dreams and hopes are only awak ened not fulﬁlled and he who has endured most suffering most privation will awaken in the afterwards most keenly alive such long speeches metaphysics whispers to us and we repeat them often leaving out the it may be sometimes we believe them and forge our philosophies from them even we go so far to assert that had we the power we would change nothing absolutely nothing in the world and yet if by some miracle such power came into our hands how triumphantly we would send to the devil all philosophies and lofty all ideals and metaphysics and plainly and simply without reﬂection abolish sufferings deformiti es failures all those things to which we attach such high educational value abolish them from the face of the earth we are fed up oh how fed up we are with carrying on our studies but it ca be helped faute mieux let us keep on inventing systems thinking them out but let us agree not to be cross with those who want to have anything to with our systems really they have perfect right 32 old age must be all say even the old and the young willingly meet the demand but in such spontaneous even often emphatic respect is there not something insulting to old age every young man by his voluntary deference seems to say and still the rising star shines brighter than the setting and the old accepting the respect are well aware that they can count on nothing more the young are attentive and respectful to the old only upon the express condition that the latter shall behave like old people and stand aside from life let real man try to follow faust example and what shindy there will be the old being rule helpless are compelled to bow to public opinion and behave if their only interests were the interests of righteousness good name and platonic attributes only few go against the convention and these are monsters and degenerates we not wish old men to have desires so that life is arranged if old men desired nothing this of course is great matter even the young are compelled to be satisﬁed with less than nothing in our system we are not out to meddle with human rights our point is that science and philosophy take enforced appearances reality grey hair is supposed to be sure sign of victory over the passions hence seeing that we must all come to grey hairs therefore the ultimate business of man is to overcome the passions on this granite foundation whole systems of philosophy are built it is not worth while quarrelling with us continue to pay respect to old age but let us look in other directions philosophic bases it is time to open free road to the passions even in the province of metaphysics 33 dostoevsky diaboli like nietzsche disliked protestantism and tried every means of degrading it in the eyes of the world normally he was not over scrupulous it is probable he never took the trouble to acquaint himself with luther teaching his ﬂair did not deceive him the protestant religion and morality was most unsuitable to him and his kind but does this mean that it was to be calumniated and judged dostoevsky judged it merely by the etymological meaning of word protester one who only protests and has positive content child book of history will show the absurdity of the deﬁnition protestantism is on the whole the most positive assertive creed of all the christian religions it certainly protested against catholicism but against the destructive tendencies in the latter and in the name of positive ideals catholicism relied too much on its power and its spell and most of all on the infallibility of its dogmas to which it offered millions of victims to maim and mutilate man ad major gloriam dei was considered perfectly proper thing in the middle ages the period of bloom catholicism at the risk of appearing paradoxical i venture to assert that ideas have been invented only the purpose of giving the right to mutilate people the middle ages nourished mysterious incomprehensible hatred everything normal complete young healthy handsome man at the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https himself aroused suspicion and hostility in believing catholic his very appearance offended religion and confuted dogma it was not necessary to examine him even though he went to church and gave sign of doubt either in deed or word yet he must be heretic to be converted at all cost and we know the catholic cost privation asceticism mortiﬁcation of the ﬂesh the most normal person kept on monastic regime will lose his spiritual balance and all those virtues which belong to healthy spirit and healthy body this was all catholicism needed it tried to obtain from people the extreme endeavour of their whole being ordinary natural love which found its was sinful monks and priests were condemned to monstrous and abnormal passions developed poverty was preached and the most unheard greed appeared in the world the more secret the stronger it became humility was and out of monks sprang despots who had limits to their ambition luther was the last man to understand the meaning and value of the tasks which catholicism had set itself what he saw in rome was not the accidental outcome of this or the other historical circumstance but result of the effort of generations that had striven to attribute to life alarming and dangerous nature possible the sincere direct rustic german monk was too to make out what was going on in rome he thought there existed one truth and that the essence of catholicism lay in what seemed to him an exemplary virtuous life he went direct to his aim what meaning can monasticism have why deprive priest of family happiness how accept the licentiousness of the pope capital the common sense of the normal german revolted against the absurdity of such state of luther neither could nor would see any good where common sense was utterly forgotten the violent oscillation of life resulting from the continuous quick passage from asceticism and blind faith to unbelief and freedom of the passions aroused mystic horror in the honest monk and released the enormous powers in him necessary to start the great struggle how could he help protesting and who was the denier luther or the rome which passed on from the keeping of the divine word to the arbitrary ordaining of all the mysteries of life luther might have forgiven the monks had they conﬁned themselves to sophistries but mediaeval monks had nothing in comm on with our philosophers they did not look in books and logical tournaments amused them only moderately they threw themselves into the deeps of life they experimented on themselves and their neighbours they passed from mortiﬁcation to licentious bacchanalia they feared nothing spared nothing in word the rome against which luther arose had undertaken to build babylon again not with stones but with human souls luther horriﬁed withdrew and with him half europe was withdrawn that is his positive merit and dostoevsky attacked lutheranism and pitied the old catholicism and the breathless heights to which its spiritual children had risen wholesome morality and its support is not enough dostoevsky all this is not positive it is only protest whether i am believed or not i will repeat that vladimir soloviov who held that dostoevsky was prophet is wrong and that mikhailovsky who calls him cruel talent and grubber after buried treasure is right dostoevsky grubs after buried doubt about that and therefore it would be more becoming in the younger generation that still marches under the ﬂag of pious idealism if instead of choosing him spiritu al leader they avoided the old sorcerer in whom only those gifted with great shortsightedness or lack of experience in life could fail to see the dangerous man 34 it is boring and difﬁcult to convince people and after all not necessary it would be much better if every individual kept his own opinions unfortunately it can not be whether you like it or not you have to admit the law of gravitation some people ﬁnd it necessary to admit the origin of man from the monkey in the empirical realm however humiliating it may be there are certain real binding universal truths against which rebellion will avail with what pleasure would we declare to representative of science that ﬁre does not burn that rattlesnakes are not poisonous that fall from high tower is perfectly agreeable supposing he were obliged to prove to us the contrary unluckily the scientiﬁc person is free from the burden of proof nature proves the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https if nature like metaphysics set out to compel us through syllogisms or sermons to believe in her how little she would get out of us she is much more sagacious morality and logic she has left to hegel and spinoza herself she has taken cudgel now then try to argue against this you will give in against your will the cleverest of all the metaphysicians cath olic inquisitors imitated nature they rarely tried the word and trusted to the ﬁre of faggots rather than of the heart had they only had more power it would not be possible to ﬁnd two people in the whole world disbelieving in the infallibility of the pope metaphysical ideas dreamily expecting to conquer the world by reasoned exposition will neve r attain dominion if they are bent on success let them try more ef fective methods of convincing 35 evolution recent years we see more and more change in the philosophies of writers and even of people the old men are beside shiftiness seems indecent after all convictions are not gloves but the young carelessly pass on from one idea to another irresolute men are somewhat timid and although they abandon their former convictions they not declare the change openly others however plainly announce if it were nothing how far they now are from the beliefs they held six months ago one even publishes whol volumes relating how he passed on from one philosophy to another and then to third people see nothing alarming in that kind of evolution they believe it is in the ordering of things but not so at all the readiness to leave off one set of convictions in order to assume another set shows complete indifference to convictions altogether not nothing the old sound the alarm but to us who have fought so long against all kinds of constancy the levity of the young is pleasant sight they will don materialism positivism kantianism spiritualism and so on one after the other till they realise that all theories ideas and ideals are of little consequence the and crinolines of our grandmothers then they will begin to live without ideals and purposes without foresight relying on chance and their own ready wit this way too must be tried perhaps we shall better by it anyhow it will be more fun 36 strength of eakness and paralysis of the will very dangerous disease in our times and in most other times consists not in the absolute loss of desire such takes place in the very old but in the loss of the capacity to translate desire into deed diseased will is often met in violently passionate men so that the say i will not not i can not not always hold good man often would but can not and then the force of desire instead of moving to outward creation works inwardly this is justly considered the most dangerous effect of the weakening of the will inward working is destructive working man does not only to put it scientiﬁcally fail to adapt nature to his needs but he loses his own power of adaptability to outward circumstances the most ordinary doctor or even anybody decides that he has before him pathological case which must be treated with care the patient is of the same opinion whilst he still hopes but when the treatment has had results the doctor draws back and speaks of the inadequacy of his science then what is the patient to retire upon it is disgusting to speak of an incurable disease so he begins to think think the time about things of which nobody thinks he is gradually forgotten and gradually he forgets ﬁrst of all that widespread truth which asserts that judgments are valid save those that are accepted and universal not that he disputes the truth he forgets it and there is none to remind him to him all his judgments seem valid and important of course he can not advance the principle let all men turn from the external world into themselves but why advance principl at all one can simply say i am indifferent to the destinies of the external world i not want to move mountains or turn rivers aside or rearrange the map of europe i even want to go to the tobacconist to buy cigarettes i want to anything i want to think that my inaction is the the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https thing on earth that any disease is better than health and so on and so on without end to what thought will not man abandoned by medicine and doctors sink down his judgments are not binding on us that is clear day but are they uninteresting and is that paralysis that weakness of will disease only 37 death and metaphysics superﬁcial observer knows that the best things in life are hard to attain some psychologists even consider that the chief beauty of the highest things consists in their unattainability this is surely not there is grain in it the roads to good things are dangerous to travel is it because nature is so much poorer than we imagine so she must lock up her blessings or is there some greater meaning in it that we have not guessed the fact is the more alluring an end we have in view the more risks and horrors we must undertake to get there may we not also make contrary suggestion that behind every danger something good is hidden and that therefore danger serves an indication mark to guide us onwards not warning we are taught to believe to decide this would be to decide that behind death the greatest of dangers must lie the most promising things it is well not to speculate further we had best stop lest we quarrel even with metaphysics traditional metaphysics has always been able to illumine our temporal existence with the reﬂected beams of eternity let us follow the example let us make attempt to know the absolute if you have discovered comforting hypothesis even in the upper transcendental air drag it quickly to earth where labouring men forever await even an imaginary relief from their lot we must make use of everything even of death to serve the ends of this life of ours 38 the futur clever reasonable boy accustomed to trust his common sense read in book children description of shipwreck which occurred just the passengers were eating their sweets at dessert he was astonished to learn that everyone women and children well who could give in saving the ship left their dessert and rushed on deck with wailing and tears why wail why rush about why be stupidly agitated the crew knew their business and would all that could be done if you are going to perish perish you will matter how you scream it seemed to the boy that if he had been on the ship he woul d just have gone on eating his sweets to the last moment justice should be done to this judicious and irreproachable opinio there remained only few minutes to it not have been better to enjoy them the logic is perfect worthy of aristotle and it was found impossible to prove to the boy that he would have left his sweets even his favourite sweets under the same circumstances and rushed and screamed with the rest hence not decide about the future common sense is uppermost and sweets are your highest law but you will get rid of normality and sense you will link on with nonsense and absurdity and probably you will even get taste bitters what you think 39 priori synthetic judgments we know found in mathematics and the natural sciences priori synthetic judgments was he right or wrong are the judgments he indicated priori or posteriori anyhow one thing is certain they are not accepted absolutely but only relatively indisputable in metaphysics where the only curious and important truths are hidden the case is different kant was compelled to admit that just where metaphysics begin the capac ity of our human reason to judge priori ends but since we can not dispense with metaphysical judgments he proposed to substitute them postulates at the same time he admitted the optimistic presupposition that in the domain of the transcendental we shall ﬁnd all that we miss in the world of phenomena so that because he could not invent truly scientiﬁc metaphysics he contrived to present us with sort which is to say after many journeys he the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https readers along the opposite way right back to the very spot from which he led them off surely metaphysics existed before kant the mediaeval philosophers had plenty of phantasies and speculations all supported by moral proofs if kant wanted to reform metaphysics he should have got rid of its favourite method of obtaining truths through inferential conclusions men are greedy they want to learn much and get their knowledge cheap so they think that every truth they have paid with experience and loss of energy entitles them to few more truths gratis or in philosophic language priori by deduction they are not ashamed to speculate with gift that has been given them instead of looking listening touching seeking they want to infer and conclude certainly if they could wring any secret out of nature matter by what means cunning impudence fraud we would forgive are not judged but nothing comes of their conclusions save metaphysical systems and empty prattle it is surely time to give up conclusions and get truth posteriori did shakspeare goethe dostoevsky that is every time you want to know anything go and look and ﬁnd out and if one is lazy or horriﬁed at new experiment let him train himself to look on ultimate questions with indifference the positivists but moral ontological and such like arguments it is disgusting to talk about them every new experiment is interesting but our conclusions synthetic judgments priori are mostly pompous lies not worth the scrap of paper on which they are recorded 40 general rules go to philosophers genera l principles and since philosophers are human they are kept busy supplying the market with general principles but what sense is there in them none at all nature demands individual creative activity from us men wo understand this so they wait forever the ultimate truths from philosophy which they will never get why should not every person be creator live in his own way at his own risk and have his own experience children and raw youths must go in leading strings but adult people who want to feel the reins should be despi sed they are cowards and slothful afraid to try they eternally go to the wise advice and the wise not hesitate to take the responsibility the lives of others they invent general rules if they had access to the sources of knowledge what foolery the wise are wiser than the have only more conceit and effrontery every intelli gent man laughs in his soul at bookish views and are not books the work of the wise they are often extremely only in so far they not contain general rules woe to him who would build up his life according to hegel schopenhauer tolstoy schiller or dostoevsky he must read them but he must have sense mind of his own to live with those who have tried to live according to theories from books have found this out at the best their efforts produced banality there is alternative whether man likes or not he will at last have to realise that cliches are worthless and that he must live from himself there are unive rsal us manage with ones only professors will suf fer it 41 metaphysical consolations mercilessly persecutes all eudaemonistic doctrines seeing in them sort of laesio majestatis of human dignity our dignity forbids us to place human happiness in the highest goal suppose it is so but why then invent consolations even metaphysical ones why give to such pure ideal concept metaphysics such coarse sensual partner consolation in the kantian meaning of the word metaphysics had much better associate herself with proud disconsolation consolation brings calm and ease even quiet gratiﬁcation to the soul but surely if metaphysics condescend to accept any assistance whatever she must scorn all earthly gratiﬁcations leave them to wingless positivism and materialism what are joys and pains to metaphysics is one thing they another yet all of sudden metaphysicians begin to shout about consolations evidently there is misunderstanding here and big one the more you pierce to the ultimate ends of the inﬁnite the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https problems the more ﬁnite they reveal themselves metaphysicians only look out some new nearly said pleasure voltaire said that if there was god then he should be invented we explain these words by the great frenchman extreme positivism but the form only is positive the content is purely metaphysical all that metaphysician wants to is to convince himself that god exists matter whether he is mistaken or not he has found consolation it is impossible him to see that his belief in certain fact does not make that fact veritable the whole question is whether there does exist supreme conscious first cause or whether we are slaves to the laws of dead necessity but what does the metaphysician care about this real question having declared himself the avowed enemy of eudaemonism he next seeks consolation nothing but consolation to doubt his right to be consoled drives him to fury and madness he is prepared to support his convictions by every from righteous indignation to ﬁsts it is obviously futile to try to enlighten such creature once man cares nothing god and seeks only to make the best of his life you will not tear away his attention from the immediate moment but perhaps there is god and neither voltaire nor the metaphysicians have any need to invent him the metaphysicians never saw that an avowed disbelief in god does not prove the of god but just the opposite it is surer sign of faith than ever belief is unfortunate metaphysicians they might have found their greatest consolation here and ﬁsts and moral indignation and other forms of chastisement to which they have been driven might have been spared us 42 practical advice who read much must always keep it in mind that life is one thing literature another not that authors invariably lie i declare that there are writers who rarely and most reluctantly lie but one must know how to read and that is easy out of hundred have idea what they are reading about it is common belief example that any writer who sings of suffering must be ready at all times to open his arms to the weary and this is what his readers feel when they read his books then when they approach him with their woes and ﬁnd that he runs away without looking back at them they are ﬁlled with indignation and talk of the discrepancy between word and deed whereas the fact is the singer has more than enough woes of his own and he sings them because he ca get rid of them canto nella gabbia non di gioia ma di rabbia says the italian proverb the bird sings in the cage not from joy but from rage it is impossible to love sufferers particularly hopeless sufferers and whoever says otherwise is deliberate liar come unto all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest but you remember what the jews said about him he speaks one having authority and if jesus had been unable or had not possessed the right to answer this sceptical taunt he would have had to renounce his words we common mortals have neither divine powers nor divine rights we can only love our neighbours whilst they still have hope and any pretence of going beyond this is empty swagger ask him who sings of suffering nothing but his songs rather think of alleviating his burden than of requiring alleviation from him surely not ever should we ask any poet to sob and look upon tears i will end with another italian saying non un si triste cane che non meni la coda dog so wretched but he wags his tail sometimes 43 if patient fulﬁls all the orders of sensible doctor we say he behaves wisely if he wantonly neglects his treatment we say he acts stupidly if healthy person wished to inoculate himself with some dangerous should say he was mad and forcibly restrain him to such an extent are we convinced that disease is evil health good what is our conviction based at glance the question seems absurd but then at glance people would absolutely refuse to doubt the ﬁxity of the earth at glance an ordinary person would giggle if he was shown the problem of the relation between the real world and the ideal who knows what would seem amenable the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https to the ordinary person the philosopher has right to appeal to the ordinary person the philosopher must doubt and doubt and doubt and question when nobody questions and risk making ock of himself if common sense were enough to settle all problems we should have known everything long age so we value health more than sickness or even is better health or sickness if we will drop the utilitarian point of all are agreed that this has place in we shall see at once that we have grounds whatever preferring health and sickness we have invented neither the one nor the other we found them both in the world along with us why then we who know so little about it take upon ourselves to judge which are nature successes which her failures health is sickness disagreeable but this consideration is unworthy of philosopher otherwise why be philosopher why distinguish oneself from the herd the philosopher invented morality which has at its disposal various pure ideas that have relation to empirical life then let us go further reason should have supply of pure ideas also let reason judge in her own independent way without conforming to conventional ideas when she has other resort let her proceed by the method of negation everything that common sense asserts i reason declare to be false sense says sickness is bad reason therefore asserts that sickness is the highest boon such reason we should call autonomous like real monarch it is guided only by its own will let all considerations point in favour of health reason must remain inexorable and keep her stand till we are all brought to obedien ce she must praise suffering deformity failure hopelessness at every step she must ﬁght and utilitarianism until mankind is brought under is she afraid of rebellion must she in the last issue like morality adapt herself to the inclinations of the mob 44 experience and science we are well aware science does not nay can not admit experience in all its extent she throws overboard an enormous quantity of individual facts regarding them the ballast of our human vessel she takes note only of such phenomena alternate constantly and with certain regularity best of all she likes those phenomena which can be artiﬁcially provoked when so to speak experiment is possible she explains the rotation of the earth and succession of the seasons since regular recurrence is observable and she demonstrates thunder and lightning with spark from an electric machine in word in so far regular alternation of phenomena is observable so far extends the realm of science but what about those individual phenomena which not recur and which can not be artiﬁcially provoked if all men were blind and one moment recovered his sight and opened his eyes on god world science would reject his evidence yet the evidence of one seeing man is worth that of million blind sudden enlightenments are possible in our n if they endure only few seconds must they be passed over in silence because they are not normal and can not be provoked treated poetically beautiful ﬁctions science insists on it she declares that judgments are true except such can be veriﬁed by all and everyone she exceeds her bounds experience is wider than scientiﬁc experiment and individual phenomena mean much more to us than the constantly recurrent science is she need not pretend to truth she can not know what truth is she can only accumulate universal laws whereas there are and always have been scientiﬁc ways of searching truth ways which lead if not to the innermost secrets yet to the threshold these roads however we have let fall into ruin whilst we followed our modern methodologies so now we dare not even think of them what gives us the right to assert that astrologers alchemists diviners and sorcerers who passed the long nights alone with their thoughts wasted their time in vain the philosopher stone that was merely plausible excuse invented to satisfy the uninitiated could an alchemist dare to confess openly that all his efforts were towards useful or utilitarian end he had to guard against importunate curiosity and impertinent authority in outsiders so he lied now frightening now alluring the mob through its cupidity but certainly he had his own important work to and it had only one fault that it was purely personal to him the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https personal matters it is considered correct to keep silent astonishing fact rule man hesitates over triﬂes but it does sometimes occur that moment arrives when he is ﬁlled with courage and resolution in his judgments he is ready to stand up his opinions against all the world dead or living whence such sudden surety what does it mean rationally we can discover foundation it if lover has got into his head that his beloved is the fairest woman on earth worth the whole of life to him if one who has been insulted feels that his offender is the basest wretch deserving torture and death if columbus persuad es himself that america is the only goal his will convince such men that their opinions shared by none but themselves are false or unjustiﬁable and whose sake will they renounce their tenets the sake of objective truth that is the pleasure of the assurance that all men after them will repeat their judgment truth they care let don quixote run broadcast with drawn sword proving the beauty of dulcinea or the impending horror of windmills matter of fact he and the german philosophers with him have vague idea kind of presentiment that their giants are but and that their ideal on the whole is but common girl driving swine to pasture to defy such deadly doubt they take to the sword or to argument and not rest until they have succeeded in stopping the mouth of everybody when from all lips they hear the praise of dulcinea they say yes she is beautiful and she never drove pigs when the world beholds their windmilling exploits with amazement they are ﬁlled with triumph sheep are not sheep mills are not mills you might imagine they are knights and cyclops this is called proven binding universal truth the support of the mob is necessary condition of the existence of modern philosophy and its knights of the woful countenance scientiﬁc philosophy wearies new cervantes who will put stop to its paving the way to truth by dint of argument all opinions have right to exist and if we speak of privilege then preference should be given to such are most run down namely to such opinions can not be veriﬁed and which are that reason universal once long ago man invented speech in order to express his real relation to the universe so he may be heard even though the relation he wishes to express be unique not to veriﬁed by any other individual to attempt to verify it by observations and experiments is strictly forbidden if the habit of objective veriﬁcation has destroyed your native receptivity to such an extent that your eyes and ears are gone and you must rely only on the evidence of instruments or objects not subject to your will then of course nothing is left you but to stick to the belief that science is perfect knowledge but if your eyes live and your ear is away instruments and apparatuses forget methodology and scientiﬁc and try to trust yourself what harm is there in not having universal judgments or truths how will it hurt you to see sheep sheep it is step forward you will learn not to see with everybody eyes but to see none other sees you will learn not to meditate but to conjure up and call forth with words alien to all but yourself an unknown beauty and an power not nothing i repeat did astrologers and alchemists scorn the experimental by the way far from being anything new or particularly modern is old the hills animals experiment though they not compose treatises on inductive logic or pride themselves on their reasoning powers cow who has burnt her mouth in her trough will come up cautiously next time to feed every experimenter is the he systematises but animals can often trust to instinct when experience is lacking and have we humans got sufﬁcient experience can experience give us what we want most if so let science and craftsmanship serve our everyday need let even philosophy also eager to serve go on ﬁnding universal truths but beyond craft science and philosophy there is another region of knowledge through all the ages men each one at his own risk have sought to penetrate into this region shall we men of the twentieth century voluntarily renounce our supreme powers and rights and because public opinion demands it occupy ourselves exclusively with discovering useful information or in order not to appear mean or in our own eyes shall we accept in place of the philo sopher stone our modern metaphysics which mufﬂes her dread of actuality in postulates absolutes and apparently transcendental paraphernalia the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https the russian spirit will easily be admitted that the distinguishing qualities of russian literature and of russian art in general are simplicity truthfulness and comple lack of rhetorical ornament whether it be to our credit or to our discredit is not to judge but one thing seems certain that our simplicity and truthfulness are due to our relatively scanty culture whilst european thinkers have centuries been beating their brains over insoluble problems we have only just begun to try our powers we have failures behind us the fathers of the profoundest russian writers were either landowners dividing their time between extravagant amusement and state service or peasants whose drudgery left them time idle curiosity such being the case how can we know whether human knowledge has any limits and if we know it seems to us it is only because we have tried to ﬁnd out other people experience is not ours we are not bound by their conclusions indeed what we know of the experience of others save what we gather very vaguely and fragmentarily and unreliably from books it is natural us to believe the best till the contrary is proved to us any attempt to deprive us of our belief meets with the most ener getic resistance the most sceptical russian hides hope at the bottom of his soul hence our fearlessness of the truth realistic truth which so stunned european critics realism was invented in the west established there theory but in the west to counteract it were invented numberless other palliating theories whose business it was to soften down the disconsolate conclusions of realism there in europe they have the suprême the deus sive natura hegel absolute kant postulates english utilitarianism progress humanitarianism hundreds of philosophic

leave to european bourgeoisie with few exceptions russian writers really despise the pettiness of the west even those who have admired europe most have done so because they failed most completely to understand her they did not want to understand her that is why we have always taken over european ideas in such fantastic forms take the sixties example with its loud ideas of sobriety and modest outlook it was most drunken period those who awaited the new messiah and the second advent read darwin and dissected frogs it is the same we allow ourselv es the greatest luxury that man can dream sincerity if we were spiritual croesuses if we had plenty of everything could afford to let everyt hing be seen ashamed of nothing but even croesuses the greatest sovereigns of the world did not consider they had the right to tell the truth at all times even kings have to of diplomacy whereas we think we may speak the truth and the truth only that any lie which obscures our true substance is crime since our true substance is the world ﬁnest treasure its ﬁnest reality tell this to european and it will seem joke to him even if he can grasp it at all european uses all his powers of intellect and talent all his knowledge and his art the purpose of concealing his real self and all that really affects him that the natural is ugly and repulsive one in europe will dispute moment not only the ﬁne arts but science and philosophy in europe tell lies instinctively by lying they justify their existence first and last european student presents you with ﬁnished theory well and what does all the ﬁnish and the completeness signify it merely means that none of our western neighbours will end his speech before the last reassuring word is said he will never let nature have the last word so he rounds off his synthesis with him ornament and rhetoric is sine qua non of creative utterance the only remedy against all ills in philosophy reigns theodicy in science the law of sequence even kant could not avoid declamation even with him the last word is moral necessity thus there lies before us the choice between the artistic and accomplished lie of old cultured europe lie which is the outcome of thousand years of hard and bitter effort and the artless sincere simplicity of young uncultured russia they are nearer the end we are nearer the beginning and which is nearer the truth and can there be question of voluntary free choice probably neither the old age of europe nor the youth of russia can give us the truth we seek but does such thing ultimate truth exist is not the very conception of truth the very assumption of the possibility of truth merely an outcome of our limited experience fruit of limitation we decide priori that one thing must be possible another impossible and from our arbitrary assumptions we proceed to deduce the body of truth each one judges in his own way according to his powers and the conditions of his existence the timid scared man worries after order that will give him day of peace and quiet youth dreams of beauty and brilliance old age does want to think of anything having lost the faculty hope and so it goes on ad inﬁnitum and this is called truth truths every man thinks that his own experience covers the whole range of life and therefore the only men who turn out to be at all in the right are empiricists and positivists there can be questio n of truth once we tear ourselves away from the actual conditions of life our conﬁdent truthfulness like european rhetoric turns out to be beyond truth and falsehood the young east and the old west alike suffer from the restrictions imposed by the former ignores the restrictions whilst the latter adapts itself to them after all it comes to pretty much the same in the end is not clever rhetoric delightful truthfulness each is equally life only we ﬁnd unendurable rhetoric which poses truth and truthfulness which would appear cultured such masquerade would try the project gutenberg ebook of all things are possible by leo shestov https us believe that truth which is only limitedness has real objective existence which is offensive until the contrary is proved we need to think that only one assertion has or can have any objective reality that nothing on earth is impossible every time somebody wants to force us to admit that there are other more limited and limiting truths we must resist with every means we can lay hands on we not hesitate even to make use of morality and logic both of which we have abused so often but why not use them when man is at his last resources he does not care what weapons he picks up 46 nur für schwindelfr be proper i ought to ﬁnish with moral i ought to say to the reader that in spite of all i have said or perhaps because of all i have in conclusions you are aware in spite of is always interchangeable with because of particularly if the conclusion be drawn from many scattered then because of all i have said hope is not lost every destruction leads to construction sweet rest follows labour dawn follows the darkest hour and so on and so on and so the banalities with which writer recon ciles his reader but it is never too late reconciliation and it is often too early so why not postpone the moral few even few dozen years god granting us the length of life why make the inevitable conclusion at the end of every book i am almost certain that sooner or later i can promise the reader all his heart desires but not yet he may of course dispense with my consolations what promises matter anyhow especially when neither reader nor writer can fulﬁl them but if there is escape if writer is ﬁnally obliged to admit in everybody hearing that the secret desir es of poor mankind may yet be realised let us at least give the wretched writer respite let him postpone his confession till old usque ad inﬁnitum meanwhile our motto nur für schwindelfr eie there are in the alps narrow precipitous paths where only mountaineers may go who feel giddiness only the it says on the he who is subject to giddiness takes broad safe road or sits away below and admires the snowy summits is it inevitably necessary to mount up beyond the are fat pastures nor goldﬁelds they say that up there is to be found the clue to the eternal they say so many things we ca believe everything he who is tired of the valleys loves climbing and is not afraid to look down precipice and most of all has nothing left in life but the metaphysical craving he will certainly climb to the summits without asking what awaits him there he does not fear he longs giddiness but he will hardly call people after him he does want just anybody companion in such case companions are not wanted at all much less those tender ones who are used to every convenience roads street lamps careful maps which mark every change in the road ahead they will not help only hinder they will prove superﬂuous heavy ballast which may not be thrown overboard fuss over them conso le them promise them who would be bothered is it not better to go one way alone and not only to refrain from enticing others to follow but frighten them off much possible exaggerate every danger and difﬁculty in order that conscience may not prick too hard who love high altitudes love quiet us ﬁnd justiﬁcation their inactivity let us tell them they are the best the worthiest of people really the salt of the earth let us pay them every possible mark of respect but since they are subject to giddiness they had better stay down the upper alpine ways any guide will tell you are nur für schwindelfr
