this object will in my estimation be the measure of its success boston july 4 introduct ory remarks on declama tion it is not my purpose to present here theory of elocution or systematic treatise on the art of speaking my object will be accomplished if i succeed in furnishing summary of practical suggestions and hints on the subject of declamation which shall prove useful both to student and to such teachers have not made the study of elocution specialty that correct and impressive elocution is desirable attainment few will venture to deny in my judgment it is the crowning grace of liberal education to the highest success in those professions which involve public speaking it is of course indispensable person whatever is to be his destination in life who aspires to respectable education and to mingle in good society can afford to dispense with this accomplishment if young man means to succeed in life and attain distinction and inﬂuence he should spare pains in the cultivation of the faculty of speech the culture of his vocal organs should keep pace with the culture of his mental powers while acquiring know ledge of literature and science he should also form the habit of speaking his vernacular with propriety grace ease and elegance sparing effort to acquire what has been aptly called the music of the phrase that clear ﬂowing and decided sound of the whole sentence which embraces both tone and accent and which is only to be learned from the precept and example of an accomplished teacher means of acquiring an appropriate effective and graceful elocution the purposes of conversation reading and public speaking the exercise of declamation when properly conducted can not be too highly valued it must be confessed however that the practice of declaiming managed in some institutions is comparatively useless if not the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https hence arises the prejudice against it which exists in some quarters and it is not surprising that the results of declamatio n should be unsatisfactory considering the defective methods of conducting it which are still prevalent in not few places what can be expected of declamation which consists in repeating on the stage few pieces iously selected and imperfectly committed previous or accompanying vocal training the remarks of rush on this topic though made more than quarter of century ago are still to some extent applicable go to some may i say all of our colleges and universities and observe how the art of speaking is not taught see boy of but ﬁfteen treats

which should be punished in the person of his pretending but neglectful preceptor with little less than scour ging then visit conservatory of music observe there the orderly tasks the masterly discipline the unwearied superintendence and the incessant toil to produce accomplishment of voice and afterward not be surprised that the pulpit the senate the bar and the chair of the medical professorship are ﬁlled with such abominable drawlers mouthers mumblers clutterers squeakers chanters and mongers in monotony nor that the schools of singing are constantly sending abroad those great instances of vocal wonder who draw forth the intelligent curiosity and produce the crowning delight and approbation of the prince and the sage this eminent writer great work on the philosophy of the human voice has done much to correct the evil which he so graphically described there are now some schools and colleges to be found in which elocution is taught with much skill and success among the disciples of rush who have most successfully cultivated the art of elocution in america the foremost place belongs to professor william russell whose valuable and protracted labors in this department of education both an author and practical instructor merit the highest commendation the ﬁrst of my recommendations i would at the outset strenuously insist on the importance of systematic vocal culture which implies the training of the ear to perceive the various qualities and modiﬁcations of vocal expression and the training of the voice to produce them all the different functions of the voice employed in speech should be analytically exempliﬁed by the teacher and practised by the pupil in the reading or recitation of short passages in which they are well illustrated such may be found in any good manual of elocution this kind of teaching is to elocution what practice upon the scale is to music and what the practice of the eye upon the harmony and contrast of colors is to painting this course of training naturally divides itself into two departments that which is mechanical and secondly that which relates to the expression of thought and emotion tha t which is mechanical brea thing the human voice is musical instrument an organ of exquisite contrivance and adaptation of parts breath being the material of its sound vocal training should begin with the function of breathing vigorous respiration is essential to good elocution it is to good health to secure this it is necessary in the ﬁrst place to attend to the posture taking care to give the utmost freedom expansion and capacity to the chest and then to exercise and develop all the muscles employed in respiration so that they may be habitually used the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https and power both in the inhalation and expulsion of the breath whenever the voice is to be used in speaking reading singing or animated conversation the pupil should be required to assume the proper position and to bring into exercise the whole muscular apparatus of the vocal organs including the muscles of the abdomen of the back of the ribs and of the chest elocutionary exercises especially that of declamation thus practised with due regard to the function of breathing become highly beneﬁcial in hygienic point of view imparting health and vigor to the whole physical system the want of this kind of training is the cause of much of the bronchial disease with which clergymen and other public speakers are afﬂicted in the excellent work on elocution by russell and murdock the following exercises in breathing are prescribed and explained attitude of the body and position of the organs deep breathing diffusive or tranquil breathing expulsive or forcible breathing explosive or abrupt breathing sighing sobbing gasping and panting experience has proved that the respir atory organs are susceptible of high degree of development and it is well known that the strength of the voice depends on the capacity health and action of those organs it is therefore of paramount importance that elocutionary culture should be based on the mechanical function of respiration and while the elocutionist trains his pupils in such breathing exercises are above named he is at the same time giving the very best part of physical education the amount of vital power well the amount of vocal power depends upon the health and vigor of the respiratory process few are aware how much may be effected by these exercises judiciously practiced in those constitutions where the chest is narrow indicating tendency to pulmonary disease in all such cases regularly repeated deep inspirations are of the highest value it should be observed that these exercises are best performed in the open air or at least in room the windows being open the time but directions however wise or minute can supersede the necessity of competent teacher in this branch of physical and vocal training and i can not dismiss this topic without expressing my high appreciation of the value of the labors of that great master of the science of vocal culture lewis monroe of boston who is probably unsurpassed in this or any other country practica l teacher of the mechanism and physiology of speech already the beneﬁt of his instruction in this department of education is widely felt and i omit opportunity to advise teachers to avail themselves of longer or shorter course of his admirable training if there is any accomplishment which teacher should be unwilling to forego it is that of skill in elocution articula tion good articulation consists in giving to each letter its appropriate sound and to each syllable and word an accurate forcible and distinct utterance according to an approved standard of pronunciation this is what constitutes the basis of all good delivery it has been well said that good articulation is to the ear what fair hand or clear type is to the eye austin description of good articulation must not be omitted here in just articulation the words are not to be hurried over nor precipitated syllable over syllable nor it were melted together into mass of confusion they should be neither abridged nor prolonged nor swallowed nor forced they should not be trailed nor drawled nor let to slip out carelessly so to drop unﬁnished they are to be delivered out from the lips beautiful coins newly issued from the mint deeply and accurately impressed perfectly ﬁnished neatly struck by the proper organs distinct in due succession and of due weight good articulation is not only necessary to the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https condition of being heard and understood but it is positive beauty of delivery the elementary sounds of speech when properly uttered are in themselves both agreeable and impressive the attainment of this desirable accomplishment three classes of exercises are necessary upon the separate elementary sounds of the language both vowels and consonants upon their various combinations both such constitute syllables and such not and especially the more difﬁcult combinations of consonants and upon words spelling them by sounds that is uttering the elementary sounds separately and then the whole word respecting these exercises rush observes when the elements are pronounced singly they may receive concentration of organic effort which gives them clearness of sound and deﬁniteness of outline if i may so speak at their extremes that make ﬁne preparation distinct and forcible pronunciation of the compounds of speech by elementary sounds is here meant the sounds of the language which are represented by the letters of the alphabet they are represented in the

compose the word and the movements of the organs in producing them then enunciate singly the sound which the letter standing on the left has in the word when distinct idea of each sound has been acquired the practice on the separate elements may be continued without pronouncing the words i have heard these sounds given with distinctness by children ﬁve or six years of age indeed they should always be taught with the alphabet the next step in articulation proceeds with the combinations of the elementary sounds the most common combinations of consonantal sounds in pairs are those represented in the following table of combined consonants pl lf zm zn kr vd rth bl lv mp ln pr zd nth ﬂ lt mf rn rp gd thz vl ld mt nt rb bz thr tl ls md nd rf vz thn dl lz the project gutenberg ebook

when the simpler combinations have become familiar the more difﬁcult consisting of three or four consonants should be practised upon finally words should be pronounced simply words giving attention solely to the articulation not that the ﬁrst steps are expected to be perfect before the succeeding ones are attempted but that attention should be given to only one thing at time grand maxim in education when rightly understood these exercises should be commenced with the ﬁrst steps in reading and continued until the articulation is perfected and the student has acquired facility well precision grace well force and distinctness and ease have been united and permanently secured i would not be understood to afﬁrm that the mode here pointed out is the only one by which good articulation can be acquired if child is brought up among persons whose articulation is good and if from the earliest years he is trained to speak with deliberation and distinctness he will in most cases have good articulation conversational purposes without special drilling on the elements ii that which relates to the expression of thoughts and feelings including the qualities and management of the voice this branch of vocal gymnastics comprises ﬁrst the appropriate discipline of the voice its formation and development by strengthening it by extending its compass and by improving its quality so to render it full sonorous and agreeable and secondly the training of the voice in those modiﬁcations which are used in the expressions of thoug ht and feeling including all that variety of management which appears in the delivery of good speaker strength to secure the requisite strength of voice should be our ﬁrst aim in course of vocal culture so important was this element of elocutionary training considered by the athenians that they had class of teach ers who were wholly devoted to it specialty the zeal and perseverance of demosthenes in correcting the natural deﬁciencies of his voice have passed into proverb how he was accustomed to run up the steepest hills and to declaim on the when the waves were violently agitated in order to acquire strength of voice and force of utterance is known to every if strength of voice is of paramount importance to the speaker it is also an element which is very susceptible of cultivation professor russell says the fact is familiar to instructors in elocution that persons commencing practice in vocal gymnastics with very weak and inadequate voice attain in few weeks perfect command of the utmost degrees of force has already been intimated the strength of the voice depends directly upon the condition and use of the respiratory organs including the larynx and indirectly upon the general health and vigor of the whole physical system the volume of breath which can be inhaled and the force with which it can be expelled determine the degree of energy with which vocal sounds are uttered this fact affords clear indication of the proper mode of developing the strength of the voice it is evident that the exercises which have their object the strengthening of the voice should also be adapted to develop and perfect the process of breathing the student should be frequently trained in set exercises in loud exclamations pronounc ing with the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https the separate vowel sounds single words and whole sentences and at the same time taking care to bring into vigorous action all the muscular apparatus of respiration shouting calling and loud vociferation in the open air both while standing and while walking or running are with due caution effective means of acquiring vigor of utterance children when at play are instinctively given to vociferation which should be permitted whenever practicable one of the most remarkabl examples of the extent to which the power of voice may be developed is that of the rev whiteﬁeld the celebrated itinerant preacher having listened to his preaching in the open air in philadelphia on certain occasion franklin found by computation that he might well be heard by more than thirty thousand auditors it is said that the habit of speaking gave to the utterance of garrick so wonderful an energy that even his under was distinctly audible to ten thousand people porte r sums up this matter thus the public speaker needs powerful voice the quantity of voice which he can employ at least can employ with safety depends on his strength of lungs and this again depends on sound state of general health if he neglects this all other precautions will be useless comp ass when person is engage d in earnest conversation his voice spontaneously adopts certain key or pitch this is called the natural or middle key and it varies in different persons pitt voice it is said was full tenor and fox treble when speaker is incapable of loud and forcible utterance on both high and low notes his voice is said to be wanting in compass webster voice was remarkable the extent of its compass ranging with the utmost ease from the highest to the lowest notes required by spirited and diversiﬁed delivery and such was said to be the versatility of whiteﬁeld vocal power that he could imitate the tones of female or the infant voice at one time and at another strike his hearers with awe by the thunder of his under the want of compass is more frequently the result of bad habits of speaking and imperfect training than of incapacity of the vocal organs murdock the actor and elocutionist tells us that by appropriate vocal training he gained within the space of some months to such an extent in power and depth of voice to add to its previous range full octave and this improvement was made at period after he supposed himself nearly broken down in health and voice by over on the stage command of the low notes is essential to the fullest effect of impressive eloquence the strongest and deepest emotions can be expressed only by full utterance speaking on one key with only slight variations either above or below it is perhaps the most common and at the same time the most injurious fault both of declaimers and of public speakers means of acquiring compass of voice the student should pronounce with great force the vowel sounds on both the highest and lowest notes he can reach this elementary drill should be followed by practice in reading and declaiming selections requiring the extreme notes of the compass practice on the low notes passages should be selected expressing deep solemnity awe horror melancholy or deep grief the following ﬁne simile affords an excellent example practice on the low notes so when an angel by divine command w ith rising tempests shakes guilty land such of late pale brittania the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https calm and serene he drives the furious blast and pleased th almighty orders to perform rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm the development of the top of the voice requires practice upon passages expressing brisk gay and joyous emotions and the extremes of pain fear and grief

properties we have considered strength and compass and yet be very far from perfection it may be neither loud nor round nor clear nor full nor sweet while on the other hand it may be hollow or aspirated or guttural or nasal or possibly it may be afﬂicted with combination of these faults one of the most important conditions of success in the cultivation of the voice it is necessary that the student should acquire distinct conception of the qualities and characteristics of good voice standard ideal which he may strive to reach this must be derived mainly from the illustrations of the teacher or from listening to the speaking of an accomplished orator mere description is adequate to convey it to the learner without the aid of the living voice and yet such quaint and charming description of both the negative and positive qualities of good voice the following from colloquy between professor wilson and the ettrick shep herd is worth studying nor th professor wilson james i

hold communion with friend or foe the quality of voice to which i would here call special attention is called pure tone which in its perfection accompanied with strength and compass comprises nearly all the requisites of good voice true utterance and pure tone says professor russell emp loy the whole apparatus of voice in one consentaneou s act combining in one perfect sphere of sound if it may be so expressed the depth of effect produced by the resonance of the chest the force and ﬁrmness imparted by the due compressi on of the throat the clear ringing property caused by the due proportion of nasal effect and the softening and sweetening inﬂuence of the head and mouth the orotund quality which is so effective in impassioned utterance and in the expression of deep forcible and sublime emotions is nothing more than pure tone increas ed in extent of volume and in intensity of force this modiﬁcation of pure tone is very full very rounds very smooth and very highly resonant or ringing it is what rush regarded the highest perfection of and the natural language of the highest speci es of emotion volume and energy are its distinguishing characteristics the piece from webster on page 160 is good illustration of its use in cultivating purity of tone it is necessary in the ﬁrst place to ascertain the elements of impurity and their causes and remedies to this negative process must be added the positive to the due and propo rtionate development of all the vocal organs depth is increased by the expansion of the pharynx roundness and volume are promoted by the enlar gement of the oral cavity especially its back part and smoothness is the result of the free vibration of the vocal chords while resonance is produced by the proper expansion of the chest modula tion this has reference not to the qualities of the voice itself but to its management in delivery it includes those modiﬁcations and variations which are requisite the expression of thoughts and feelings and are therefore denominated by some elocutionists the elements of expression in distinct ion from the elements of utterance which we have already considered under the preceding heads the principal expressive modiﬁcations of the voice are pitch force rate pause and infection the voice should be exercised on these elements separately till each can be produced in all its varieties and degrees the middle pitch or is that of common discourse but by practice it may be rendered effective in public speaking neglect to cultivate and develop the power of speaking on this key often leads speakers to adopt the high shouting note which is heard so commonly and with so much disapprobation at exhibitions of declamation every one can speak on high key the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https training few can it pleasingly but command over the low notes of the voice is rare accomplishment and an unequivocal characteristic of the ﬁnished speaker it is well to pay some attention to the very high and very low notes not so much their own utility in public speaking the purpose of giving strength and ﬁrmness to the notes which are intermediate between the natural pitch and either extreme and which are designated simply high and low without any qualifying term after accustoming the ear and voice to the different notes the student should learn to make sudden transitions from one key to another force the principal degrees of force requiring attention are three the moderate the declamatory and the impassioned the degrees lower than moderate are the suppressed and the subdued and those higher than impassioned are shouting and calling but these are not very important in practical delivery rate has reference to the kinds of movement in delivery including the rapid the moderate and the slow siddon primary rule good reading was take time excessive rapidity of utterance is undoubtedly very prevalent fault both in speaking and in conversation deliberate speech is usually characteristic of culture and this excellence is greatly promoted by giving due quantity or prolongation of sound to the vowels pauses besides the pauses required by the syntactical structure of the sentence and denoted by grammatical punctuation there are the pauses of passion and the pauses at the termination of the clusters into which words are grouped in good speaking the pauses of emotion occur in impassioned delivery they usually consist in lengthening the stops indicated by the punctuation marks especially those of the points of exclamation and interrogation and the dash pauses of this description constitute one of the most importent of the elements of emphatic expression and yet they are by many speakers altogether neglected or so abridged to destroy their effect the young student is particularly apt to disregard them the pauses which mark the grouping of words according to the sense and afford rests taking breath should generally be intro duced before the nominative if it consists of several words or if it is one important word before and after an intermediate clause before the relative before and after clauses introduced by prepositions before conjunctions and before the inﬁnitive mood if any words intervene betwixt it and the word governing it inflections the two chief inﬂections or slides are the raising and the falling the voice when properly managed usually rises or falls on each emphatic syllable these upward and downward movements of the voice are what we mean by inﬂections the student should practice on them till he can inﬂect with ease and in full sonorous voice persons who are deﬁcient in tune not readily perceive the difference between the rising slide and loudness of voice or the falling and softness it is very useful exercise to pronounce the long vowel sounds giving to each ﬁrst the rising then the falling slide the prolongation of these sounds is most proﬁtably connected with the slides the voice being thus strengthened in its whole range of compass and at the same time accustomed to utter the musical sounds of speech with due quantity in inﬂecting the vowels the voice in order to rise begins low and in order to fall it begins the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https rising and falling slides combined form the circumﬂex or wave whic h is very impressive and signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the voice it is chieﬂy used in sarcasm raillery irony wit and humor it well deserves careful study and practice the monot one is the repetition of nearly the same tone on successiv syllables resembling the repeated strokes of the bell this element belongs to very grave delivery especially where emotions of awe sublimity grandeur and vastness are expressed and is peculiarly adapted to devotional exercises the following example well illustrates its use he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet and he rode upon cherub and did ﬂy yea he did ﬂy upon the wings of the wind he made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies in practical delivery the elements of expression are never used independently of each other two or three being always combined even in the utterance of the shortest passage the perfection of vocal training therefore requires command not merely of each individual modiﬁcation of the voice but of all their numerous combinations the following example requires the union of declamatory force low pitch slow rate monotone and orotund quality high on throne of royal state which far outshone the wealth of ormus and of ind or where the gor geous east with richest hand showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold satan exalted sat what has been said thus far relates wholly to preparatory training in the elements of elocution i have dwelt upon this theoretical department of my subject because of its transcendent importance but i not mean to imply in anything that has been presented that the pupil should be conﬁned exclusively to this disciplinary drill long period without attempting practical exercises in reading and declamation on the contrary i would recommend that this practice on the vocal and expressive elements be carried forward together with practice in speaking pieces exerci ses in vocal gymnastics such i have now indicated should be commenced with the ﬁrst stages of education and continued with gradations adapted to the age and progress of the pupil through the whole course of instru ction whether longer or shorter the value of thorough elementary training is well illustrated by the following anecdote respecting the education of the ear and the singing voice porpora one of the most illustrious masters of italy having conceived friendship young pupil exacted from him the promise that he would persevere with constancy in the course which he should mark out him the master then noted upon single page of ruled paper the diatonic and chromatic scales ascending and descending the intervals of third fourth ﬁfth this eternal page occupied master and pupil until the sixth year when the master added some lessons in articulation and declamation at the end of this year the pupil who still supposed himself in the elements was much surprised when porpora said to him my son you have nothing more to learn you are the ﬁrst singer of italy and the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https world the master had spoken the truth this singer was caffarelli the greatest singer of the eighteenth century expression this term is used here not in its limited and technical meaning but in its largest sense convenient one to denote the practical application of the principles of vocal culture which i have recommended we will suppose the student to be thoroughly trained in enunciation that his utterance is distinct and his pronunciation is correct and that his voice is fully developed and well modulated the question now arises how is he to be guided in the right use of his powers of speech in the delivery of given piece on this point there is wide difference of opinion among writers on elocution on the one hand there are those who contend that in the delivery of every sentence the application of emphasis pause pitch inﬂection should be governed by deﬁnite rules in accordance with this theory they have formed complex systems of elocutionary rules the guidance of pupils in reading aloud and in declamation on the other hand there are authorities of eminence who regard all speciﬁc rules the management of the voice in speaking not merely useless but positively injurious most prominent among the latter class is archbishop whately who in speaking of the method of teaching expressive delivery by rules says such plan not only directs us into circuitous and difﬁcult path towards an object which may be reached by shorter and straighter but also in most instances completely fails of that very object and even produces oftener than not effects the very reverse of what was designed reprobating very emphatically all systematic attention to elocution an art this eminent author advocates what he calls the natural mann er of speaking the attainment of which he prescribes the rule not only to pay studied attention to the voice but studiously to withdraw the thoughts from it and to dwell intently possible on the sense trusting to nature to suggest spontaneously the proper emphasis and tones the true course seems to to lie midway between these two opposite extremes while it is useless to attempt to reduce to exact system all the modiﬁcations of voice to be employed in the delivery of both plain and allegorical language still there are many important elocutionary rules and principles which are eminen tly useful the guidance of the student because walker fell into the error of attempting to carry his principles too far and perplexed the student with an endless list of rules it does not follow that all rules should be disregarded his rules inﬂections are doubt too complex and artiﬁcial ordinary instruction in elocution but those found in the works of porter and professor russell are calculated to afford important aid and professor mark bailey in his introduction to hillard sixth reader has still further simpliﬁed the subject the following principles which he lays down regulating the inﬂections are at once comprehensive and practical the and slides separate the great mass of ideas into two distinc t classes the ﬁrst comprising all the subordinate or incomplete or we prefer to name them the negative ideas the second comprising all the principal or complete or we call them the positive ideas the most important parts of what is spoken or written are those which afﬁrm something positively such the facts and truths asserted the principles sentiment s and actions enjoined with the illustrations and reasons and appeals which enforce them all these the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https be grouped into one class because they all should have the same kind of slide in reading this class we call ideas so all the other ideas which not afﬁrm or enjoin anything positively which are circumstantial and incomplete or in open contrast with the positive all these ideas may be properly grouped into another single class because they all should have the same kind of slide this class we call ideas positive ideas should have the falling slide negative ideas should have the rising slide all sincere and earnest or in other words all upright and downright ideas demand the straight or upright and downright slides all ideas which are not sincere or earnest but are used in jest or irony in ridicule sarcasm or mockery in insinuation or demand the crooked or circumﬂex slides these rules taken in connection with the accompanying brief but clear and precise explanation of the meaning attached to the words positive and negative constitute the most admirable generalization that i have met with in elocutionary works of more recent date than that of rush and indeed professor bailey whole treatment of that part of elocution now under consideration is the best illustration i can name of the middle course which i recommend avoiding alike the ultra artiﬁcial system of walker and the ultra natural system of whately he combines in his instruction the excellencies of both without their faults he is both philosophical in his theory and practical in its application he attempts only what is practicable he insists on analysis but his analysis is at once simple and comprehensive he classes the different kinds of compos ition with respect to the emotions follows unemotional bold animated or joyous subdued or pathetic noble grave ludicrous or sarcastic impassioned then indicates the modiﬁcations of voice appropriate each now such course of training based on such principles especially if pursued under competent instructor can not fail to be highly beneﬁcial experience has proved it whately is evidently in error in wholly proscribing attention to the voice in speaking in learning to dance the pupil must pay attention to the motions of his limbs but when practice has made the movements familiar his mind is withdrawn from them they then become natural just so will the student of elocution in his disciplinary exercises he must attend to his voice he must become accustomed to the correct application of tones and inﬂections in the delivery of passages which illustrate them but when he comes to practical delivery then the mind should be withdrawn from the manner of utterance and concentrated intensely upon the matter thoughts and feelings to be expressed in private rehearsals the management of the voice will be very prominent object of attention declamation is sort of transition stage or intermediate exercise between private rehearsal and practical delivery at the bar in the pulpit or on the platform and will require more or less attention to the voice in proportion to the progress already made by the pupil judicious practice will gradually carry him to that point where he will wholly cease to think of his manner and become entirely absorbed in his subject he then becomes natural but even the most accomplished orator must occasionally give some thought to his voice when he rises to address an audience in new place he must consider the circumstances capacity of the apartment the nature and temper of his auditors the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https his voice accordingly in other words the speaker must on all occasions give general attention to his voice at least to adapt it to the requirements of the position in which he is placed modifying it in the progress of the discourse the necessity of the case demands if the matter of his discourse is very familiar the skilful speaker may greatly augment the effectiveness of his deliver y by more particular attention to the manner while he will seem wholly absorbed in the spirit and sense of what he utters gesture the limited space allotted to this introduction will not permit full discussion of this topic and i must content myself with presenting few general observations concerning it the little child in the unconscious freedom of childhood before his actions and manners have been modiﬁed by the restraints of artiﬁcial life affords the best model of gesture his instinct prompts him to that visible expression of his thoughts and feelings which we are toiling all our lives to ﬁnd and it may be assumed general fact that external expression unless repressed by habit or design usually corresponds with internal emotion the great desideratum in gesture is to make the visible expression in delivery harmonize with the audible or shakspeare has it to suit the action to the word and the word to the action professor russell in his excellent analysis of this subject says the true speaker must have true manner and of the ﬁve great attributes of genuine expression in attitu and action truth stands ﬁrst followed by firmness force freedom and propriety grace which is sometimes added sixth is in all true manly eloquence but another name the symmetry which ﬂows from appropriateness and in masculine expression should never be distinct object of attention in order to speak well the orator must be able to stand well that is he should assume ﬁrm but easy and graceful attitude the weight of the body resting principally on one foot the distance between the feet should be such to give both ﬁrmness and freedom to the position one foot should be in advance of the other the toes being turned outward the attitude should vary with the thoughts and emotions expressed unemotional thoughts require an attitude of repose the body resting on the retired foot bold and impassioned language requires the reverse of this the body is thrown forward resting on the foot advanced in turning from side to side the toes should be kept apart and the heels together the principal feature of bodily action consists in the proper use of the hands have not says quintilion our hand the power of exciting of restraining of beseeching of testifying approbation admiration and shame they not in pointing out places and persons dischar ge the duty of adverbs and pronouns so amidst the great diversi ty of pervading all nations and peoples the language of the hands appears to be language common to all men we stretch forth and clasp the hands when we importunately entreat sue beseech supplicate or ask mercy to put forth the right hand spread open is the gesture of bounty liberality and free heart and thus we reward and bestow gifts placing with vehemence the right ﬁst in the left palm is gesture commonly used to mock chide insult reproach the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https to beckon with the raised hand is universal sign of craving audience and entreating favorable silence to wave the hand from us the palm outward is the gesture of repulsion aversion dismissal to shake the ﬁst at one signiﬁes anger and deﬁance and threatening the hands are clasped or wrung in deep sorrow and outstretched with the palms inward to indicate welcoming approving and receiving in shame the hand is placed before the eyes in earnestness and ardor the hands reach forward in joy they are thrown up widely apart in exultation and triumph the right hand is waved above the head in the rhetorical actions of the hand the happy medium ought to be observed the action of the hand should be full of dignity and magnanimous resolution making it liberal index of the mind french writer admirably remarks that we should move the arms because we are animated but not try to appear animated by moving the arms the countenance especially the eye should be made to speak well the tongue it is said of chatham that such was the power of his eye that he very often cowed down an antagonist in the midst of his speech and threw him into confusion it is through the eye scarcely less than through the tones of voice that intercourse of soul is carried on between the speaker and hearers to secure this intercourse the speaker should let his soul beam from his eye nor should he fail to look at his hearers if he would have his hearers look at him among the faults to be avoided in the manage ment of the eye porter notices particularly that unmeaning look which the eye bent on vacuity has resembling the inexpressive glare of the glass eye of wax ﬁgure that indeﬁnit sweep of the eye which ranges from one side to the other of an assembly resting nowhere and that tremulous roving cast of the eye and winking of the eyelid which is in direct contrast to an open collected manly expression of the face among the faults of action to be noticed are want of action want of expression of countenance stiff or careless attitude want of appropriateness excess of motions of the hands and arms too great violence of action too great complexity mechanical uniformity tardiness the action following the utterances when it should accompany it or slightly precede it it must not be supposed that it is necessary the pupil to receive training in technical system of gesticulation before he commences his exercises in declamation if the student designs to qualify himself to be professor of elocution he will need to study the laws of gesture in austin chironomia and be instructed in their application by skillful teacher but this course is neither practicable nor necessary the mass of students instruction in this department should generally be of negative nature and occupy itself mainly in the correction of faults when the pupil commences his exercises in declamation the less said about action the better freedom is the ﬁrst thing to be secured and to attain this end few directions should be given and few criticisms be made at the outset when the speaker has acquired some conﬁdence and freedom of action his faults may be gradually pointed out and his attention called to some general principles of gesture such have been presented respecting the language of the hands pupils should be taught to observe accurately the action of accomplished orators not with the view to imitating their peculiarities but to learn their method of producing ef fect by means of attitude and gesture declama the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https should be attended to in all grades of educational institutions from the primary school to the college and every pupil should be required to take his turn in the performance of the exercise it would be highly beneﬁcial if well taught the reason why so many teachers have taste it is because they have not taken pains to qualify themselves to teach it want of time is sometimes offered an excuse neglecting it but if part of the time which is devoted to teaching reading were appropriately to declamation the progress in reading itself would be more rapid to say nothing of other advantages which would result from this course i can not too earnestly urge upon every teacher the importance of qualifying himself teaching well both reading and declamation there is accomplishment which more effectively promotes the success of the teacher than that of elocutionary culture good voice skillfully managed in conversation and in teaching without special attention to the subject teachers are apt to acquire certain characteristic faults of voice such nasality sharpness harshness and thinness of tone of which they are quite unconscious whereas by constant attention to the manner of using the voice since they are in constant practice it might be perfected in its modulation want of culture in the elocutionary art many teachers are greatly deceived thinking their pupils read and declaim well when they not in the management of declamation much care should be taken in the selection of the pieces it is best the pupil in the ﬁrst place after proper advice to exercise his own taste in the selection of his piece which should then be submitted to the teacher approval if the selection is very appropriate the pupil should be commended and told why the piece is considered suitable if the selection presented is not suitable the pupil should be informed on what ground it is objected to so to aid his judgment in another attempt if the pupil has made proper effort without success he should be assisted by the teacher it is very important that the selection should be suited to the capacity and progress of the pupil beginners should take simple pieces and not be allowed is sometimes the case to murder passage from paradise lost or macbeth sometimes fault is committed on the part of the teacher by permitting pupil to conﬁne his selections to one favorite class i have observed in certain schools that one particular boy would always appear in comic piece another in tragic and so on it would be better the teacher to require each pupil to speak variety of pieces so to secure more general and comprehensive culture than would result from practice on single class of selections the choice of the piece should be determ ined upon considerable period previous to the day appointed the public performance of the stage so to afford ample time preparation the piece should be accurately committed to memory without the variation of syllable it should be made familiar so that in the delivery effort will be required in recalling it the young pupil should be instructed in the best method of learning his piece it will generally be found best to take one sentence at time the teacher chief work consists in attending to individual private rehearsals the rehearsal should be drill the piece should be analyzed more or less minutely the allusions and difﬁcult points being explained it should be the ﬁrst aim to make the pupil understand it not only in its general spirit and scope but in its particular ideas his attention should then be turned to the emotions which it expresses let it be remembered that the paramount object should be to make the pupil understand the meaning and feel the spirit of the piece if he is timid and difﬁdent he should be encouraged tell him that even daniel webster could not make declamation at the ﬁrst attempt but that he did not despair he did not cease his ef forts he persevered and the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https the rehearsal the pupil should have time to practice by himself and apply and conﬁrm the instruction received from his teacher it must be impressed upon his mind that if he would attain excellence he must practice practice practice he must be made to understand that the repetition of piece three or four times is adequate preparation and that it is necessary to go over with it twenty thirty or ﬁfty times if he would excel and take high rank when the declamation takes place excepting on public occasions the criticisms ought to be made immediately after the performance of each speaker the faults of the difﬁdent should be mildly criticized it is very important to call attention to points of special excellence in any performance it should be remembered that judicious commendation is most powerful stimulant to exertion the most difﬁcult task in teaching declamation is to develop that indescribable fervor that unaffected earnestness of manner which always captivates the hearers and wins the highest marks at an exhibition prizes there will always be one speaker in school who excels all the rest in this quality the teacher should point out the peculiar excellence of this speaker and show wherein it differs from loudness of voice and violence of actions and affected passion let it be remembered that the perfection of declamation consists in deliverin g the piece though it were real speaking the speaker must put himself in imagination so completely into the situation of him whom he personages and adopt the moment so perfectly all the sentiments and views of that character to express himself exactly such person would have done in the supposed situation give the speaker every other his enunciation his modulation of voice and his action be faultless and yet without earnestness real earnestness the semblance of it not boisterous vociferation not convulsive gesticulation but genuine emotion felt in the heart carrying the conviction to the hearers that the sentiments uttered are real the spontaneous irrepressible outpouring of the thought and feeling of the speaker this sovereign crowning quality he can not be said to speak with eloquence to bring out and develop this highest quality of delivery requires the highest skill in the teacher unless the teacher possesses some degree of this quality himself he can not develop it in his pupils the best immediate preparation speaking is rest i have often noticed that speakers at exhibitions have in many cases failed to themselves justice from sheer exhaustion day or two of repose previous to speaking enables the speaker to bring to the perform ance that vigor of the faculties which is indispensable to the highest success webster told the senate and truly doubt that he slept soundly on the night previous to the delivery of his second speech on foote resolution which is considered his greatest parliamentary effort it is well the speaker to remember what everett said in allusion to this fact so the great condé slept on the eve of the battle of rocroi so alexander slept on the eve of the battle of arbela and so they awoke to deeds of immortal fame the best training can not make good readers and good speakers of all pupils but it can much and it is fact worthy of observation that those who are most sceptical to the possibilities of elocutionary culture are invariably those who are themselves unskillful teachers in this the project gutenberg ebook of the

of their gaping wounds to accelerate their dissolution and while their blood was issuing presented their ghastly eyes to heaven breathing their last and fervent prayer that the dry earth might not be suffered to drink their blood but that it might rise up to the throne of god and rouse the eternal providence to avenge the wrongs of their country it be said that all this was brought about by the

that it could ever have become matter of disputation i speak not of its power in reining the taste in disciplining the judgment in invigorating the understanding or in warming the heart with elevated sentiments but of its power of direct positive necessary instruction there is not single nation from the north to the south of europe from the bleak shores of the baltic to the bright plains of immortal italy whose literature is not embedded in the very elements of classical learning the literature of england is in an emphatic sense the production of her scholars of men who have cultivated letters in her universities and colleges and grammar of men who thought any life too short chieﬂy because it left some relic of antiquity unmastered and any other fame too humble because it faded in the presence of roman and grecian genius he who studies english literature without the lights of classical learning loses half the charms of its sentiments and style of its force and feelings of its delicate touches of its delightful allusions of its illustrative associations who that reads the poetry of gray does not feel that it is the reﬁnement of classical taste which gives such inexpressible vividness and transparency to his diction who that reads the concentrated sense and melodious versiﬁcation of dryden and pope does not perceive in them the disciples of the old school whose genius was inﬂamed by the heroic verse the terse satire and the playful wit of antiquity who that meditates over the strains of milton does not feel that he drank deep at siloa brook that ﬂowed fast by the oracle of god that the ﬁres of his magniﬁcent mind were lighted by coals from ancient altars it is exaggeration to declare that he who proposes to abolish classical studies proposes to render in great measure inert and unedifying the mass of english literature three centuries to rob us of the glory of the past and much of the instruction of future ages to blind us to excellencies which few may hope

populace with the sports of the amphitheatre to an extent hitherto unknown even in that luxurious city the shouts of revelry had died away the roar of the lion had ceased the last loiterer had retired

tales and savage wars that very night the romans landed on our shore and the dash of steel was heard within our quiet vale i saw the breast that had nourished trampled by the iron hoof of the warhorse the bleeding body of my father ﬂung amid the blazing rafters of our dwelling i killed man in the arena and when i broke his helmet clasps behold was my friend he knew faintly died the same sweet smile that i had marked upon his face when in adventurous boyhood we scaled some lofty cliff to pluck the ﬁrst ripe grapes and bear them home in childish triumph i told the prætor he was my friend noble and brave and i begged his body that i might burn it upon the and mourn over him ay upon my knees amid the dust and blood of the arena i begged that boon while all the roman maids and matrons and those holy virgins they call vestal and the rabble shouted in mockery deeming it rare sport forsooth to see rome ﬁercest gladiator turn pale and tremble like very child before that piece of bleeding clay

to deal with it calmly but explicitly i believe the north is ready to stand by the constitution with all its compromises it now is i not intend moreover to throw out any threats of disunion whatever may be the result i not intend now or ever to contemplate disunion cure any imaginable evil at the same time i not intend to be driven from ﬁrm expression of purpose and steadfast adherence to

according to my honorable friend theory bad prefa ce to rational esteem and affection it prepares its votaries reconciliation of differences lying down with their most inveterate enemies like the leopard and the kid in the vision of the prophet this dogma is little startling but it is not altogether without precedent it is borrowed from character in play which is i dare say great favorite with my learned friend it is with mean the comedy of the rivals in which malaprop giving lecture on the subject of marriage to her niece who is unreasonable enough to talk of liking the project gutenberg

am sure i hated your poor dear uncle like blackamoor before we were married and yet you know my dear what good wife i made him such is my learned friend argument to hair but ﬁnding that this doctrine did not appear to go down with the house so glibly he had expected my honorable and learned friend presently changed his tack and put forward theory which whether novelty or beauty i pronounce to be incomparable and in short wanting nothing to recommend it but slight foundation in truth true philosophy says my honorable friend will always continue to lead men to virtue by the instrumentality of their conﬂicting vices the virtues where more than one exists may live harmoniously together but the vices bear mortal antipathy to one another and therefor furnish to the moral engineer the power by which he can make each keep the other under controls admirable but upon this doctrine the poor man who has but one single vice must be in very bad way fulcrum moral power effecting his cure whereas his more fortunate neighbor who has two or more vices in his composition is in fair way of becoming very virtuous member of society i wonder how my learned friend would like to have this doctrine introduced into his domestic establishment instance suppose that i dischar ge servant because he is addicted to liquor i could not venture to recommend him to my honorable and learned friend it might be the poor man only fault and therefor clearly incorrigible but if i had the good fortune to ﬁnd out that he was also addicted to stealing might i not with safe conscience send him to my learned friend with strong recommendation saying i send you man whom i know to be drunkard but i am happy to assure you he is also thief you can not better than employ him you will make his drunkenness

their political situation is part of the consideration to which member of parliament may fairly turn his attention i know not more solemn or important duty that member of parliament can have to

horses that draws the chariot along sir if the comparison must be made if the distinction must be taken men are everything measures computatively nothing i speak sir of times of difﬁculty and danger of times when systems are shaken when precedents and general rules of conduct fail then it is that not to this or that measur prudently devised however blameless in execution to the energy and character of individuals state must be indebted its salvation then it is that kingdoms rise or fall in proportion they are upheld not by the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by

resources that he had but to turn them to account t rue and he did so compare the situation in which he found france with that to which he has raised her i am panegyrist of bonaparte but i can not shut my eyes to the superiority of his talents to the amazing ascendency of his genius tell not of his measures and his policy it is his genius his character that keeps the world in awe sir to meet to check to curb to stand up against him we want arms of the same kind i am far from objecting to the large military establishments which are proposed to you i vote them with all my heart but the purpose

coming the treasure you must have and what price she may next demand who shall tell it may even be the mace which rests upon that woolsack what may follow your course of obstinacy if persisted in i can not take upon to predict nor i wish to conjecture but this i know full well that sure man is mortal and to err is human justice deferred enhances the price at which you must purchase safety and

right to despair successful ruler in all the difﬁculties of course wholly untried but warrior whose sword only left its sheath when the ﬁrst law of our nature commanded it to be drawn and ruler who

absolutely incalculable and such work you are aware is the iliad of homer who can estimate the results produced by the incomparable efforts of single mind who can tell what greece owes to this of song her breathing marbles her solemn temples her unrivalled eloquence and her matchless verse all point us to that transcendent genius who by the very splendor of his own effulgence woke the human intellect from the slumber of ages it was homer who gave laws to the artist it was homer who inspired the poet it was homer who thundered in the senate and more than all it was homer who was sung by the people and hence nation was cast into the mould of one mighty mind and the land of the iliad became the region of taste the birthplace of the the project gutenberg ebook of the american union

david or isaiah or john but i can not pursue this comparison i feel that it is doing wrong to the mind which dictated the iliad and to those other mighty intellects on whom the light of the holy oracles never shined if then so great results have ﬂowed from this one effort of single mind what may we not expect from the combined efforts of several at least his equals in power over the human heart if that one genius though groping in the thick darkness of absurd idolatry wrought so glorious transformation in the character of his countrymen what may we not look from the universal

of national vicissitudes shall california be received myself upon my individual judgment and conscience i let california come in every new state whether she come from the east or the west every new state coming from whatever part of the contin ent she may is always welcome but california that comes from the clime where the west dies away into the rising east that bounds at once the empire and the continent the youthful queen of the paciﬁc in her robes of freedom gorgeously inlaid with gold is doubly welcome the question now arises shall this one great people having common origin common language common religion common sentiments interests sympathies and hopes remain one political state one nation one republic or shall it be broken into two conﬂicting and probably hostile nations or republics shall the american people then be divided before deciding on this question let us consider our position our power and capabilities the world contains seat of empire so magniﬁcent this which

to determine and happily it is not important to be determined it is enough if we agree that expectations so grand yet so reasonable and so just ought not in any degree to be disappointed and now it

never again can be province or colony nor can she be made to shrink or shrivel into the proportions of federal dependent territory california then henceforth and forever must be what she is now state

anniversary of the revolution in hungary anniversaries of revolutions are almost always connected with the recollections of some patriot death on that day like the spartans at thermopylæ martyrs of devotion to their fatherland almost in every country there is some proud cemetery or some modest tombstone adorned on such day by garland of evergreen pious offering of patriotic tende rness i passed the last night in sleepless dream and my soul wandered on the magnetic wings of the past home to my beloved bleeding land and i saw in the dead of the night dark veiled shapes with the paleness of eternal grief upon their terrible in the fearless silence of that over the churchyards of hungary and kneeling down to the head of the graves and depositing the pious tribute of green and cypress upon them and after short prayer rising with clenched ﬁsts and gnashing teeth and then stealing away tearless and silent they came away because the bloodbounds of my country murder lurks from every corner on that night and on this day and leads to prison those who dare to show pious remembrance to the beloved smile on the lips of magyar is taken crime of deﬁance to tyranny and tear in his eye is equivalent to revolt and yet i have seen with the eye of my soul thousands performing the work of patriotic piety and i saw more when the pious offerer s stole away i saw the honored dead half risen from their tombs looking to the offerings and whispering gloomily still cypress and still ﬂower of joy is there still the chill of winter and the gloom of night over thee fatherland are we not yet revenged and the sky of the east reddened suddenly and quivered with bloody ﬂames and from the far far west lightning ﬂashed like stripe and within its light young eagle mounted and soared towards the

mine is the revenge i will make the stars of the west the sun of the east and when ye next awake ye will ﬁnd the ﬂower of joy upon your cold bed and the dead took the twig of cypress the sign of resurrection into their bony hands and lay the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https was the dream of my waking soul and i prayed and such was my prayer father

and civil political social and religious liberty shall be the common property of all the people whatever tongue it may speak or in whatever church pray and that national ministry shall execute these laws and guard with its responsibility the chartered ancient independence of our fatherland two days before austria brave peopl in vienna had broken its yoke and summing up despots in the person of their tool old metternich drove him away and the hapsbur gs trembling in their imperial cavern of imperial crimes trembling but treacherous and lying and false wrote with letters the words

of justice and freedom the people of pesth rose in peaceful but majestic manifestation declaring that the people should be free at this manifestation all the barriers raised by violence against the laws fell of themselves not drop of blood was shed man who was in prison becaus he had dared to write book was carried home in triumph through the streets the people armed itself national guard the windows were illuminated and bon ﬁres burnt and when these tidings returned back to presbur g blended with the cheers from vienna they warmed the chill of our house of lords who readily agreed to the laws we pro posed and there was rejoicing throughout the land the ﬁrst time centuries the farmer awoke with the pleasant feeling that his time was now his the ﬁrst time went out to till his ﬁeld with the consoling thought that the ninth part of his harvest will not be taken by the landlord nor the tenth by the bishop both had fully resigned their feudal portion and the air was brightened by the

about the most ﬂagrant violation of the laws of nations and seeing by the silence of great britain and of the united states that she may dare to violate those laws our heroes had to meet fresh force

how to take them he had caused the earth to produce corn bread all this he had done his red children because he loved them if we had some disputes about our they were generally settled without the shedding of much blood but an evil day came upon us your forefathers came across the great water and landed on this island their numbers were small they found friends and not enemies they told us they had ﬂed from their own country fear of wicked men and asked small seat we took pity the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https granted their request and they sat

perhaps allayed his feelings they were ﬁghting they knew to repress the uncontrolled ambition of the grand monarch but if man were present now at the ﬁeld of slaughter and were to inquire what they were fighting would be the answer they are ﬁghting they are pausing why is that man expiring why is that other writhing with agony what means this implacable fury the answer must be you are quite

one another they have now cause of quarrel but their country thinks that there should be pause all that you see sir is nothin g like is harm nor cruelty nor bloodshed in it whatever it is nothing more

single hour i know of evil that ever has existed nor can imagine any evil to exist worse than the tearing of eighty thousands persons annually from their native land by combination of the most civilized nations in the most enlightened quarter of the globe but more especially by that nation which calls herself the most free and the most happy of them all even if these miserable beings were proved guilty of every crime before you take them off of which however not single proof is adduced ought we to take upon ourselves the ofﬁce of executioners and even if we condescend so far still can

remaining in africa are involved in consequence of carrying off so many myriads of people you think nothing of their families which are left behind of the connections which are broken of the

american production it is the embodiment and vindication of our transatlantic liberty born upon our soil of parents also born upon it never moment having had sight of the old world instructed according to the modes of his time only in the spare plain but wholesome elementary knowledge which our institutions provided the children of the people growing up beneath and penetrated by the

most formidable obstruction to the progress of injustice and oppression and it grows more intelligent and more intense it will be more and more formidable it may be silenced by military power but it can not be conquered it is elastic irrepressible and invulnerable to the weapons of ordinar y warfare it is that impassive inextinguishable enemy of mere violence and arbitrary rule which like milton

fortresses surrendered what armies subdued or what provinces overrun in the history of the year that has passed by us and in the instance of unhappy spain we have seen the vanity of all triumphs in cause which violates the general sense of justice of the civilized world it is nothing that the troops of france have passed from the pyrenees to cadiz it is nothing that an unhappy and prostrate nation has fallen before them it is nothing that arrests and conﬁscation and execution sweep away the little remnant of national resistance there is an enemy that still exists to check the glory of these triumphs it follows the conqueror back to the very scene of his ovations it calls upon him to take notice that europe though silent is yet indignant it shows him that the sceptre of his victory is barren sceptre that it shall confer neither joy nor honor but shall moulder to dry ashes in his grasp in the midst of his exultation it pierces his ear with the cry of injured justice it denounces against him the indignation of an enlightened and civilized age it turns to bitterness the cup of his rejoicing and wounds him with the sting which belongs to the consciousness of having outraged the

turns on its hinges without noise and he enters and beholds his victim before him the room was uncommonly open to the admission of light the face of the innocent sleeper was turned from the murderer and the beams of the moon resting on the gray locks of his aged temple showed him where to strike the fatal blow is given and the victim passes without struggle or motion from the repose of sleep to the repose of death it is the assassin purpose to make sure work and he plies the dagger though it is obvious that life has been destroyed by the blow of the bludgeon he even raises the aged arm that he may not fail in his aim at the heart and replaces it again over the wounds of the poniard to ﬁnish the picture he explores the wrist the pulse he feels it and ascertains that it beats longer it is accomplished the deed is done he retreats retraces his steps to the window passes out through it he came in and escapes he has done the murder eye has seen him ear has heard him the secret is his own

that are to surround this college now i will not arraign the founder of this institution or his motives this i will not inquire into his opinions upon religion but i feel bound to say the occasion demands that i should say that this is the most opprobrious the most insulting and unmerited stigma that ever was cast or attempted to be cast upon the preachers of christianity from north to south from east to west through the length and breadth of the land in the history of the country when have they deserved it where have they deserved it how have they deserved it they are not to be allowed even the ordinary rights of hospitality not even to be permitted to put their foot over the threshold of this college sir i take it upon myself to say that in country in the world upon either continent can there be found body of ministers of the gospel who perform so much service to man in such full spirit of under so little encouragement from government of any kind and under circumstances almost always much straitened and often distressed at the ministers of the gospel in the united states of all denominations they form part of any established order of religion they constitute hierarchy they enjoy peculiar privileges in some of the states they are even shut out from all participation in the political rights and privileges enjoyed by their they enjoy tithes public provision of any kind except here and there in large cities where wealthy individual occasionally makes donation the support of public worship what have they to depend upon they have to depend entirely on the voluntary contributions of those who hear them and this body of clergymen has shown to the honor of their own country and to the astonishment of the hierarchies of the old world that it is practicable in free governments to raise and sustain by voluntary contributi ons alone body of clergymen which devotedness to their sacred calling purity of life and character learning intelligence piety and that wisdom which cometh from above is inferior to none and superior to most others i hope that our learned men have done something the honor of our literature abroad i hope that the courts of justice and mem bers of the bar of this country have done something to elevate the character of the profession of the law i hope that the discuss ions above in congress have done something to meliorate the condition of the human race to secure and extend the great charter of human rights and to strengthen and advance the great principles of human liberty but i contend that literary efforts adjudications constitutional discussions nothing that has been said or done in favor of the great interests of universal man has done this country more credit at home and abroad than the establishment of our body the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https their support by voluntary contributions and the general excellence off their character piety and learning the great

not call him fool because he happens to be chancellor of the exchequer but i say he is one who has abused the privilege of parliament and the freedom of debate by uttering language which if spoken out of the house i should answer only with blow i care not how high his situation how low his character how contemptib le his speech whether privy counsellor or parasite my answer would be blow he has charged with being connected with the rebels the charge is utterly totally and meanly false does the honorable gentleman rely on the report of the house of lords the foundation of his assertion if he does i can prove to the committee there was physical impossibility of that report being true but i scorn to answer any man my conduct whether he be political coxcomb or whether he brought himself into power by false glare of courage or not i have returned not the right honorable member has said to raise another have returned to dischar ge an honorable debt of gratitude to my country that conferred great reward past services which i am proud to say was not greater than my desert i have returned to protect that constitution of which i was the parent and founder from the assassination of such men

the character of those whose conduct in political matters violates every precept and slanders every principle of the religion of christ but what is politics is it not the science and the exercise of civil rights and civil duties and what is religion is it not an obligation to the service of god founded on his authority and extending to all our relations personal and social yet religion has nothing to with politics where did you learn this maxim the bible is full of directions your behavior citizens it is plain pointed awful in its injunctions on ruler and ruled such yet religion has nothing to with politics you are commanded in all your ways to acknowledge him in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving to let your requests be made known unto god and whatsoeve r ye in word or deed to all in the name of the lord jesus yet religion has nothing to with politics most astonishing and is there any part of your conduct in which you are or wish to be without law to god and not under the law of jesus christ can you persuade yourselves that political men and measures are to under go review in the judgment to come that all the passion and violence the fraud and falsehood and corruption which pervade the system of party and burst out like ﬂood at the public elections are to be blotted from the catalogue of unchristian deeds because they are politics or that minister of the gospel may see his people in their political career bid deﬁance to their god in breaking through every moral restraint and keep guiltless silence because religion has nothing to with

the name of the constitution which it violated i denounce it in the name of the sovereignty of massachusetts which was stricken down by the blow i denounce it in the name of humanity i denounce it in the name of civilization which it outraged i denounce it in the name of that fair play which bullies and respect what strike man when he is pinioned when he can not respond to blow call you that chivalry in what code of honor did you get your authority that god knows my heart i desire to speak with kindness i speak in spirit of revenge i not believe the member has friend who must not in his heart of hearts condemn the act even the member he has left spark of that chivalry and gallantry attributed to loathe and scorn the act but much i reprobate the act much more i reprobate the conduct of those who stood by and saw the outrage perpetrated magnanimous slidell prudent douglas audacious toombs sir there are questions arising out of this which are far more important than those of mere personal nature of these personal considerations i shall speak when the question comes properly before us if i am permitted to so the higher question involves the very existence of the government itself if sir freedom of speech is not to remain to us what is the government worth if we from massachusetts or any other state or members of the house are to be called to account by some gallant uncle when we utter something which does not suit their sensitive nature we desire to know it if the conﬂict is to be transferred from the peaceful intellectual ﬁeld to one where it is said honors are easy and responsibilities equal then we desire to know it massachusetts if her sons and representatives are to have the rod held over them she utters threats may be called upon to withdraw them to her own bosom where she can furnish to them that protection which is not vouchsafed to them under the ﬂag of their common country but while she permits us to remain we shall our duty we shall speak whatever we choose to speak whatever we will and however we will regardless of the consequences sir the sons of massachusetts are educated at the knees of their mothers in the doctrines of peace and and god knows we desire to cultivate those feelings of social kindness and public kindness the house will bear witness that we have not violated or trespassed upon any of them but sir if we are pushed too long and too far there are men from the old commonwealth of massachusetts who will not shrink from defence of freedom of speech and the state they represent in any ﬁeld where they may be assailed burlingame ccl viii strength of the government i know that i may be met at once by the objection that our general government is after all but qualiﬁed and imperfect governme nt i may be reminded that it was from massachusetts that the amendment came which expre ssly declares that all powers not given are the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https then it may be asked is there not here manifest division of sovereignty and of power and does not this show that much is all which is retained at home is constitute the full strength of national government my answer is twofold first i say the national government has at this moment by force of the constitution all the absolutely it needs or could proﬁtably use central national government i answer next that by the admirable provisions of our constitution the reserved powers of every state may be and so far that state does its duty will be prepared and developed to their utmost efﬁciency and then imparted to the nation in its need we want proof and illustration of all this very recent events have supplied one which history will not forget if we how happened it that few weeks since when the general government seemed to be feeble and was in peril and the may well say the cry help came was it that massachusetts was the ﬁrst to spring to the rescue why was it that she was able in four days from that in which this cry reached her to add new glory to the day of lexington why was it that she could begin that offering of needed aid which has since poured itself in full and swollen and rushing stream into the war power of the national government even i ask the question the answer is in all your minds it is that massachusetts could this because she had done her own duty beforehand she could this because within her own bounds she had prepared and organized her own strength and stood ready the moment when she could place it in the outstretched hands of the government and other states followed offering their contributions with almost too little of delay with haste which was sometimes precipitation with an importunate begging of it yet far behind the earnest desire and demand of the people of these states until at length we stood before an astonished world the strongest government on the face of the earth stronger therefore all the purposes to which our national government should apply its strengths stronger all the good it can and all the harm it can prevent that government is it is now constructed and because it is so constructed than it could be if it were the single central consolidated power of other nations and it will show its strength not by preventing all checks and reverses that is impossible but i believe in prompt and thorough recovery from them parsons

the slaves have enough to eat think it is all very well and that nothing more is to be said or done if slaves were merely animals whose only or chief enjoyment consisted in the gratiﬁcation of their bodily appetites there would be some show of sense in this conclusion but in fact however crushed and brutiﬁed they are still men men whose bosoms beat with the same passions our own whose hearts swell with the same aspirations same ardent desire to improve their condition the same wishes what they have not the same indifference towards what they have the same restless love of social superiority the same greediness of acquisition the same desire to know the same impatience of all external control the excitement which the singular case of caspar hauser produced few years since in

intellect or rather to preve nt it from being developed so to detain him forever in state of infantile imbecility this supposed attempt at what they saw ﬁt to denominate the murder of the soul gave rise to great discussions among the german jurists and they soon raised it into new crime which they placed at the very head of social enormities it is this very crime the murder of the soul which is in the course of continuous and perpetual perpetration throughout the southern states of the american union and not upon single individual only but upon nearly one half of the entire population

their natural desire an equal participation in the beneﬁts of society to keep them ignorant and therefore weak to reduce them if possible to state of idiocy to crowd them down to level with the brutes

regard them with the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https reverence judges are but men and in all ages have shown full share of frailty alas alas the worst crimes of history have been perpetrated under their sanction the blood of martyrs and of patriots crying from the ground summons them to judgment it was judicial tribunal which condemned socrates to drink the fatal hemlock and which pushed the saviour barefoot over the pavements of jerusalem bending beneath his cross it was judicial tribunal which against the testimony and entreaties of her father surrendered the fair virginia slave which arrested the teachings of the great apostle to the gentiles and sent him in bonds from judea to rome which in the name of the old religion adjudged the saints and fathers of the christian church to death in all its most dreadful forms and which afterwards in the name of the new religion enforced the tortures of the inquisition amidst the shrieks and agonies of its victims while it compelled galileo to declare in solemn denial of the great truth he had disclosed that the earth did not move round the sun it was judicial tribunal which in france during the long reign of her monarchs lent itself to be the instrument of every tyranny during the brief reign of terror it did not hesitate to stand forth the unpitying accessory of the unpitying guillotine ay sir it was judicial tribunal in england surrounded by all the forms of law which sanctioned every despotic caprice of henry the eighth from the unjust divorce of his queen to the beheading of sir thomas more which lighted the ﬁres of persecution that glowed at oxford and smithﬁeld over the cinders of latimer ridley and john rogers which after elaborate argument upheld the fatal tyranny of against the patriotic resistance of hampden which in deﬁance of justice and humanity sent sydney and russell to the block which persistently enforce d the laws of conformity that our puritan fathers persistently refused to obey and which afterwards with jeffries on the bench crimsoned the pages of english history with massacre and with the blood of innocent woman ay sir and it was

the recent census is not more than four hundred thousand out of whom there are not more than one hundred thousand who are interested to any considerable extent in this peculiar species of property and yet this petty controlled by squad still more popul ation of many millions has aroused and organized this gigantic rebellion the future historian will record that the present its protracted origin the multitudes it has enlisted and its extensive at last precipit ated by fewer than twenty men everett says by few ten it is certain that thus far it has been the triumph of minority but of minority moved inspired combined and aggrandized by slavery and now this traitorous minority putting aside all the lurking slimy devices of conspiracy steps forth in the full panoply of war assuming to itself all the functions of government the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https states under common ambassadors into foreign letters of sets armies in the ﬁeld summoned from distant geor gia louisiana and texas well from nearer virginia and composed of the whole lawless poor who can not own slaves well the rich who own the extensive region where with satanic grasp this slaveholding minority claims itself room and ver ge enough the characters of hell to trace pardon the language which i employ the words of the poet not picture too strongly the object proposed and now these parricidal hosts stand arrayed openly against that paternal government to which they owed loyalty protection and affection never in history did rebellion assume such front call their numbers four hundred thousand or two hundred you far surpass any armed forces ever before marshalled in rebellion they are among the largest ever marshalled in war and all this is in the name of slavery and the sake of slavery and at the bidding of slavery the proﬂigate favorite of the english famous duke of not more exclusively even according to those words by which he was exposed to the judgment of his contemporaries who rules the kingdom the king who rules the king the duke who rules the duke the devil the prevailing part here attributed to the royal favorite belongs now to slavery which in the rebel states is more than royal favorite who rules the rebel states the president who rules the president slavery who rules slavery the latter question i need not answer but all must nobody can that slavery is the ruling idea of this rebellion it is slavery which marshals these hosts and breathes into their embattled ranks its own barbarous ﬁre it is slavery which stamps its character alike upon ofﬁcers and men it is slavery which inspires all from the general to the trumpet er it is slavery which speaks in the words of command and which sounds in the morning it is slavery which digs trenches and builds hostile forts it is slavery which pitches its white tents and stations its sentries over against the national capital it is slavery which sharpens the bayonet and casts the bullet which points the cannon and scatters the shell blazing bursting with death wherever this rebellion shows form it thing it it is moved by slavery nay it is slavery itself incarnate

john philbrick https president with unspeakable delight i hail this measure and the prospect of its speedy adoption it is the ﬁrst instalment of that great debt which we all owe to an enslaved race and will be recognized in history one of the victories of humanity at home throughout our own country it will be welcomed with gratitude while abroad it will quicken the hopes of all who love freedom liberal institutions will gain everywhere by the abolition of slavery at the national capital nobody can read that slaves were once sold in the markets of rome beneath the eyes of the sovereign pontif f without confessing the scandal to religion even in barbarous age and nobody can hear that slaves are now sold in the markets of washington beneath the eyes of the president without confessing the scandal to liberal institutions the sake of our good name if not the sake of justice let the scandal disappear slavery beginning in violence can have legal or constitutional existence unless through positive words expressly authorizing it such positive words can be found in the constitution all legislation by congress supporting slavery must be unconstitutional and void while it is made still further impossible by positive words of prohibition guarding the liberty of every person within the exclusive jurisd iction of congress but the question is asked shall we vote money this purpose i can not hesitate and i place it at once under the sanction of that commanding charity proclaimed by prophets and enjoined by apostles which all history recognizes and which the constitution can not impair from time immemorial every government has undertaken to ransom its subjects from captivity sometimes whole people has felt its resources well bestowed in the ransom of its prince religion and humanity have both concurred in this duty more than usually sacred the ransom of captives is great and excelling ofﬁce of justice exclaims one of the early fathers the power thus commended has been exercised by the united states under important circums tances with the coöperation of the best names of our history so to be without question if slavery be unconstitutional in the national capital and if it be christian duty sustained by constitutional examples to ransom slaves then your swift desires can not hesitate to adopt the present bill and it becomes needless to enter upon other questions important perhaps but irrelevant sumner cclxv the same concluded of course i scorn to argue the obvious truth that the slaves here are much entitled to freedom the white slaves that enlisted the early energies of our government they are men by the grace of god and this is enough there is principle of the constitution and rule of justice which is not strong the one the other in consenting to the ransom proposed you will recognize their manhood and if authority be needed you will ﬁnd it in the example of washington who did not hesitate to employ golden key to open the house of bondage let this bill pass and the ﬁrst practical triumph of freedom which good men have longed dying without the which whole generation has petitioned and which orators and statesmen have at last be accomplished slavery will be banished from the national capital this metropolis which bears venerated name will be puriﬁed the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https spirit will be cast out its shame will be removed its society will be reﬁned its courts will be made better its revolting ordinances will be swept away and even its loyalty will be secured if not moved by justice to the slave then be willing to act your own good and in if you hesitate to pass this bill the blacks then pass it the whites nothing is clearer than that the degradation of slavery affects the master much the slave while recent events testify that wherever slavery exists there treason lurks if it does not ﬂaunt from the beginning of this rebellion slavery has been constantly manifest in the conduct of the masters and even here in the national capital it has been the traitorous power which has encouraged and strengthened the enemy this power must be suppressed at every cost and if its suppression here endangers slavery elsewhere there will be new motive determined action amidst all present solicitudes the future can not be doubtful at the national capital slavery will give way to freedom but the good work will not stop here it must proceed what god and nature decree rebellion can not arrest and the whole tyranny begins to tumble then above the din of battle sounding from the sea and echoing along the land above even the exaltations of victory on ﬁelds will ascend voices of gladness and benediction swelling from generous hearts wherever civilization bears sway to commemorate sacred triumph whose trophies inste ad of tattered banners will be ransomed slaves sumner cxlxvi extract from farewell address at new orleans i shall speak in bitterness because i am not

the enemies of my country unrepentant and implacable i have treated with merited severity i hold that rebellion is treason and that treason persisted in is death and any punishment short of that due traitor gives so much clear gain to him from the clemency of the government upon this thesis have i administered the authority of the united states because of which i am not unconscious of complaint i not feel that i have erred in too much harshness that harshness has ever been exhibited to disloyal enemies to my country and not to my loyal friends to be sure i might have regaled you with the amenities of british civilization and yet been within the supposed rules of civilized warfare you might have been smoked to death in caverns were the covenanters of scotland by the command of general of the royal house of england or roasted like the inhabitants of algiers during the french campaign your wives and daughters might have been given over to the ravisher were the unfortunate dames of spain in the peninsular war or you might have been scalped and tomahawked our mothers were at wyoming by the savage allies of great britain in our own revolution your property could have been turned over to indiscriminate loot like the palace of the emperor of china works of art which adorned your buildings might have been sent away like to paintings of the vatican your sons might have been blown

island where i encamped my own soldiers before marching here it is true i have levied upon the wealthy rebels and paid out nearly half million of dollars to feed forty thousand of the starving poor of all nations assembled here made so by this war i saw that this rebellion was war of the aristocrats against the middling the rich against the poor war of the landown er against the laborer that it was struggle the retention of power in the hands of the few against the many and i found conclusion to it save in the subjugation of the few and the disenthralment of the many i therefore felt hesitation in taking the substance of the wealthy who had caused the war to feed the innocent poor who had suffered by the war and i shall now leave you with the proud consciousness that i carry with the

conclusion of farewell address at new orleans i found you trembling at the terrors of servile insurrection all danger of this i have prevented by so treating the slave that he had cause to rebel i found the dungeon the chain and the lash your only means of enforcing obedience in your servants i leave them peaceful laborious controlled by the laws of kindness and justice i have demonstrated that the pestilence can be kept from your borders i have added million of dollars to your wealth in the form of new land from the batture of the mississippi i have cleansed and improved your streets canals

grown to its present huge dimensions it were best if it could gradually be removed but it is better far better that it should be taken out at once than that it should longer vitiate the social

power which oligarchies possess the slaveholding education gives elements of control the bearing and habit of command and the assertion of superiority this exercises its inﬂuence over weak minds

this armed contest to be great historical movement and to have high moral interest and signiﬁcance because it is to determine the character of the institutions under which we and those who come after us are to live you are not merely sustaining the administration of president lincoln against unlawful combinations but you are ﬁghting on the side of law order government civilization and progress the result of this war is to settle the question whether they who are hereafter to inhabit this magniﬁcent country are or are not to have that primal blessing of good government without which the most abundant material resources are valueless scientiﬁc books or philosophical installments would be among the most barbarous tribes of africa or australia surely there can not be imagined war more worthy of calling forth all the ener gies of great people than this and if i am asked to deﬁne my meaning more distinctly and precisely i say that the questions now submitted to the stern arbitrament of war are substantially these is the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https of the united states compact or law is this union commonwealth state or is it merely confederacy or copartnership is there right of secession in the separate states singly or collectively other than the right of revolution these are momentous questions and if they can be settled in other way than by war then such war is worth the price it costs great that is if the right of secession be fairly and logically deducible from the any state upon its own mere motion with cause or without cause can withdraw from the union partner may dissolve the constitution itself is stupendous failure the men who made it were bungling journeymen and not master mechanics and to institutions of our country so far from deserving our gratitude and admiration are worthy only of our contempt the hour has come and the men have come to settle these issues fraught with such vital consequences to unborn millions the dusky clouds surchar ged with electric ﬁres that stand front to front in mid air and darken the heavens with their power have been long in gathering let the storm continue till the air is longer i want to have it now determined that all future time any state or any cluster of states that may attempt to coerce or bully legal and constitutional majority by the threat of secession shall be met with the answer you go out of this union unless you are strong enough to ﬁght your way out i want to have the armed heel of the country crush the serpent head of secession now and forever so that it shall never again glare with its baleful eyes or brandish its venomous tongue let not the fate and fortunes of this glorious country be committed to the keeping of clumsy misshapen raft compacted of or logs good enough to ﬂoat down river but sure to go to pieces when it gets into deep water let let them be embarked on board goodly ship well found well fastened well which every timber and plank has been so fashioned to contribute to the beauty and strength of the whole fabric with good seaman at the helm the constitution in the binnacle and the stars and stripes at the masthead when the time of my departure shall come let feel let know that i leave those whom i love under the protection of government good enough to secure the affection of its subjects and strong enough to enforce their obedience remember that if strong government be sometimes bad weak government is never good hillard cclxxix the military capacity of the people we have cause gratitude in the military capacity which our people have developed we had great standing armies we had but single thoroughly furnished military school there was military profession proper inviting young men on the threshold of life to choose the trade of arms soldier garb was rare spectacle and every child ran to the window to gaze at the passing glitter whence should come our ﬁghting men if the bugle should blow you must have men before you have soldiers our institutions raised men proverbially the yankee can turn his hand to anything he likes to well what he undertakes he has pride in showing himself equal to his position above all he has force of personal character when northern regiment makes charge it is not merely the weight of so much physical humanity there goes weight of character with it why there is an accomplished schoolmaster there and the best blacksmith of the village and solid merchant and dexterous lawyer and the handiest coachman of the stable and well known on prominent public the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https butcher with an unerring cleaver and jolly tar whose vessel never missed stays with his hand at the wheel you suppose that these men are going to charge like so many nameless hessians why it is personal matter with every one of them they go in under orders to be sure but they have not lost the sense of individual responsibility the thing is to be well done because they are there i know it my friends the personal character of our recruits lends weight and irresistibleness to them soldiers there have been braver men stouter soldiers in all war red annals than these armed clerks farmers college boys and their comrades of every peaceful calling each community keeps the name of some young hero nobler than spartan mothers ever welcomed on his shield redder blood never stained the earth than those full libations our new mustered ranks have poured out union law and liberty there has been ﬁghting in the bloody past of human story where muzzle to muzzle and steel to steel bold hearts have more truly played the man than in those battles of two years past in which our citizen armies have saved our nationality never have the hardships of the camp the march the ﬁeld and the trenches and the merciless privations of imprisonment been more heroically endured it was not our president said it consecrate the sacred acres of gettysbur g that was already done by the deep baptism that had laved those hills and not that ﬁeld only but all the sands and sods and waves our boys brave blood have crimsoned land beneath

darkness and not ﬂoating bubble marks the place of their disappearing if all the populations of the world from the beginning of time were cast into its depths the smooth surface of its oblivion would close over them in an hour and if all the cities of the earth and all the structures and monuments ever reared by man were heaped together over that grave tombstone it would not break the surface of the deep or lift back their memory to the light of the sun and the breath of the upper air the sea would roll its billows in derision thousand fathoms deep above the topmost stone of that mighty sepulchre the patient earth submits to the rule of man and the mountains bow their rocky heads before the hammer of his power and the blast of his terrible enginery the sea cares not him not so much single hair breadth can its level be lowered or lifted by all the art and all the effort and all the enginery of all the generations of time he comes and goes upon it and moment after it is if he had never been there he may engrave his titles upon the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https top and quarry his signature into the foundations of the globe but he can not write his name on the sea and thus by its material uses and its spiritual voices does the sea ever speak to us to tell up that its builder and maker is god he hewed its channels in the deep and drew its barriers upon the stand and cast its belted waters around the world he ﬁtted it to the earth and the sky and poised them skilfully the one against the other when he measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the earth in measure and weighted the mountains in scales and the hills in balance he gave the sea its wonderful laws and armed it with its wonderful powers and set it upon its wonderful work all its breadth his wisdom walks on all its waves his goodness shines swain cclxxxi the battle of civilizations our war is only an appeal from the nineteenth century of freedom and ballots to the system of the sixteenth century the old conﬂict new weapon that is all the south thought because once twice thrice the spaniel north had gotten down on her knees that this time also poisoned by she woul d kiss her feet but instead of that the ﬁrst time in our history the north has ﬂung the insult back and said by the almighty the mississippi is mine and i will have it now when shall come peace out of this warlike conﬂict when shall come peace just it came in the conﬂict of parties and discussion whenever one civilization gets the uppermost positively then there will be peace and never till then there is new thing under the sun the light shed upon our future is the light of experience seventy years have not left us ignorant of what the aristocracy of the south means and plans the south needs to rule or she goes by the board she is wise powe i respect her it she knows that she needs to rule what does jefferson davis plan you suppose he plans an imaginary line to divide south carolina from new york and massachusetts what good would that an imaginary line would not shut out ideas but she must bar out those ideas that is the programme in the south he imagines he can broaden his base by allying himself to weaker race he says i will join marriage with the weak races of mexico and the southwest and then perhaps i can draw to my side the northwest with its interests an agricultural population naturally allied to and not to the northeast with its tariff set of states and he thinks thus strong quiet slaveholding empire he will bar new england and new york out in the cold and will have comparative peace but if he bar new england out in the cold what then she is still there and give it only the fulcrum of plymouth rock an idea will upheave the continent now davis knows that better than we great deal better his plan therefore is to mould an empire so strong so broad that it can control new england and new york he is not only to found slaveholding despotism but he is to make it so strong that by traitors among us and hemming us in by power he is to cripple conﬁne break down the free discussion of these northern states unless he does that he is not safe he knows it now i not say he will succeed but i the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https what i think is the plan of statesmanlike leader of this effort to make slavery safe he must mould massachusetts not into being slaveholding commonwealth but into being silent unprotesting commonwealth that maryland and virginia the carolinas and arkansas may be quiet peaceable populations he is wise man he knows what he want s and he wants it with will like julius cæsar of old he has gathered every dollar and every missile south of mason and dixon line to hurl thunderbolt that shall serve his purpose and if he does achieve separate confederacy and shall be able to bribe the west into neutra lity much less alliance dangerous time and terrible battle will these eastern states have they will never make peace the yankee who comes out of cromwell bosom will ﬁght his naseby hundred years if it last so long but he will conquer in other words davis will try to rule if he conquers he is to bring in his phrase carolina to massachusetts and if we conquer what is our policy to carry massachusetts to carolina in other words carry northern civilization all over the south it is contest between civilizations which ever conquers supersedes the other phillips cclxxxii secession the death of slavery severed from us south carolina must have government you see now reign of terror threats to raise means that can only last day some system must give support to government it is an expensive luxury you must lay taxes to support it where will you levy your taxes they must rest on productions productions are the result of skilled labor you must educate your laborer if you would have the means carrying on government despotisms are cheap free governments are dear luxury machinery is complicated and expensive if the south wants theoretical republic she must pay it she must have basis taxation how will she pay it why massachusetts with million workmen women and children little feet that can just toddle bringing chips from the massachusetts only pays her own board and lodging and lays by about four per cent year and south carolina with one half idlers and the other half slaves slave doing only half the work of freeman one quarter of the population actually at work how much you suppose she lays up lays up loss by all the laws of political econom y she lays up bankruptcy of course she does put her out and let her see how sheltered she has been from the laws of trade by the union the free labor of the north pays her plantation patrol we pay her government we pay her postage and everything else launch her out and let her see if she can make the year ends meet and when she tries she must educate her labor in order to get the basis taxation educate slaves make locomotive with its furnaces of open wirework ﬁll them with anthracite coal and when you have raised it to white heat mount and drive it through powder magazine and you are safe compared with slaveholding community educating its slaves but south carolina must it in order to get the basis taxation to support an independent government the moment she does it she removes the safeguard of slavery what is the contest in virginia now between the men who want to make their slaves mechanics the increased wages it will secure and the men who oppose fear of the inﬂuence it will have on the general security of slave property and white throats just that dispute will go on wherever the union is dissolved slavery comes to an end by the laws the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https hang up your sharpe riﬂe my valorous friend the slave does not ask the help of your musket he only says like old diogenes to alexander stand out of my light just take your awkward proportions you yankee democrat and republican out of the light and heat of god laws of political economy and they will melt the slaves chains away phillips cclxxxiii the commencement of the movement matter where you meet dozen earnest men pledged to new idea you have met them you have met the beginning of revolution revolutions are not made they come revolution is natural growth an oak it comes out of the past its foundations are laid far back the child feels he grows into man and thinks another perhaps speaks and the world acts out the thought and this is the history of modern society men undervalue the slavery movement because they imagine you can always put your ﬁnger on some illustrious moment in history and say here commenced the great change which has come over the nation not so the beginning of great changes is like the rise of the mississippi child must stoop and gather away the pebbles to ﬁnd it but soon it swells broader and broad er bears on its ample bosom the navies of mighty republic ﬁlls the gulf and divides continent i remember story of napoleon which illustrates my meaning we are apt to trace his control of france to some noted victory to the time when he camped in the tuileries or when he dissolved the assembly by the stamp of his foot he reigned in fact when his hand was ﬁrst felt on the helm of the vessel of state and that was far back of the time when he had conquered in italy or his name had been echoed over two continents it was on the day when ﬁve hundred irresolute men were met in that assembly which called itself and pretended to be the government of france they heard that the mob of paris was coming the next morning thirty thousand strong to turn them was usual in those days out of doors and where did this seemingly great power go its support and refuge they sent tallien to seek out lieutenant shadow of an ofﬁcer thin and pallid that when he was placed on the stand before them the president of the assembly fearful if the fate of france rested on the shrunken form the ashy cheek before him that all hope was gone asked young man can you protect the assembly and the stern lips of the corsican boy parted only to reply i always what i undertake then and there napoleon ascended his throne and the next day from the steps of roche thundered forth the cannon which taught the mob of paris the ﬁrst time that it had master that was the commencement of the empire so the movement commenced unheeded in that obscure hole which mayor otis could not ﬁnd occupied by printer and black boy phillips cclxxxiv touch not slavery what you the descendants of those men of iron who preferred struggle with misery on the bleak and

demands and yield to them if in our deliberate view of our duty we possibly can the question is what will satisfy them simply this we must not only let them alone but we must somehow convince them that we let them alone this we know by experience is easy task we have been trying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization but with success in all our platforms and speeches we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone but this has had tendency to convince them what will convince them this and this only cease to call slavery wrong and join them in calling it right and this must be done in acts well in words silence will not be tolerated we must place ourselves avowedly with them senator douglas new sedition law must be enacted and enforced suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong whether made in politics in presses in pulpits or in private we must arrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure we must pull down our free state constitutions the whole atmosphere must be disinfected from all taint of opposition to slavery before they will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us i am quite aware they not state their case precisely in this way most of them would probably say to us let us alone nothing to us and say what you please about slavery but we let them never disturbed that after all it is what we say

grant if they thought it wrong their thinking it right and our thinking it wrong is the precise fact upon which depends the whole controversy thinking it right they they are not to blame desiring its full recognition being right but thinking it wrong we can we yield to them can we cast our votes with their view and against our own in view of our moral social and political responsibilities can we this wrong we think slavery is we can yet afford to let it alone where it is because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation but can we while our votes will prevent it allow it to spread into the national territories and to overrun us here in these free states if our sense of duty forbids this then let us stand by our duty fearlessly and effectively

before god my conscience is clear i have struggled long peaceful solution of the difﬁculty i have not only tendered those states what was theirs of right but i have gone to the very extreme off magnanimity the return we receive is war armies marched upon our capital obstructions and danger to our navigatio n letters of marque to invite pirates to prey upon our commerce concerted movement to blot out the united states of america from the map of the globe the question is are we to be stricken down by those who when they can longer govern threaten to destroy what cause what excuse disunionists give us breaking up the best government on which the sun of heaven ever shed its rays they are dissatisﬁed with the result of presidential election did they never get beaten before are we to resort to the sword when we get defeated at the i understand that the voice of the people expressed in the mode appointed by the constitution must command the obed ience of every citizen they assume on the election of particular candidate that their rights are not safe in the union what evidence they present of this i defy any man to show any act on which it is based what act has been omitted or been done i appeal to these assembled thousands that so far the constitutional rights of the southern will say the constitutional rights of concerned nothing has been done and nothing omitted of which they can complain there has never been time from the day that washington was inaugurated ﬁrst president of these united states when the rights of the southern states stood ﬁrmer under the laws the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https land than they now there neve r was time when they had not good cause disunion they have what good cause have they now that has not existed under every administration if they say the territori al the ﬁrst time there is act of congress prohibiting slavery anywhere if it be the of the laws the only complaints that i have heard have been of the too vigorous and faithful fulﬁllment of the fugitive slave law then what reason have they the slavery question is mere excuse the election of lincoln is mere pretext the present secession movement is the result of an enormous conspiracy formed more than year by leaders in the southern confederacy more than twelve months ago they use the slavery question means to aid the accomplishment of their ends they desired the election of northern candidate by sectional vote in order to show that the two sections can not live together when the history of the two years from the lecompton charter down to the presidential election shall be written it will be shown that the scheme was deliberately made to break up this union they desired northern republican to be elected by purely northern vote and now assign this fact reason why the sections may not longer live together if the disunion candidate in the late presidential contest had carried the united south their scheme was the northern candidate successful to seize the capital last spring and by united south and divided north hold it that scheme was defeated in the defeat of the disunion candidate in several of the southern states the conspiracy is now known armies have been raised war is levied to accomplish it there are only two sides to the question every man must be the united states or against them there can be neutrals in this war only patriots or traitors douglass cclxxxviii neutrals only patriots or traitors but this is time detail of cause the conspiracy is now known armies have been raised war is levied to accomplish it there are only two sides to the question every man must be the united states or against them there can be neutrals in this war only patriots or tractors we can not close our eyes to the sad and solemn fact that war does exist the government must be maintained its enemies overthrown and the more stupendous our preparations the less the bloodshed and the shorter the struggle will be but we must remember certain restraints on our action even in time of war we are christian people and the war must be prosecuted in manne r recognized by christian nations we must not invade constitutional rights the innocent must not suffer nor women or children be the victims savages must not be let loose but while i sanction war on the rights of others i will implore my countrymen not to lay down their arms until our own rights are recognized the constitution and its guarantees are our birth right and i am ready to enforce that inalienable right to the last extent we can not recognize secession recognize it once and you have not only dissolved government but you have destroyed social order and upturned the foundations of society you have inaugurated anarchy in its worst form and will shortly experience all the horrors of the french revolution then we have solemn duty maintain the government the greater our unanimity the speedier the day of peace we have

calmer moments reasons you can give to your ferers in the calamity that it will bring upon us what reason can you give the nations of the earth to justify it they will be the calm and deliberate judges in the case and to what cause or one overt act can you point on which to rest the plea of justiﬁcation what right has the north assailed what interest of the south has been invaded what justice has been denied and what claim founded in justice and right has been withheld can either of you name one governmental act of wrong deliberately and purposely done by the government at washington of which the south has right to complain i challenge the answer while on the other hand let show the facts and believe gentlemen i am not here the advocate of the north but am here the ﬁrm friend and lover of the south and her institutions and this reason i speak thus plainly and faithfully yours mine and every other man interest the words of truth and soberness let show the facts i say of which i wish you to judge and i will only state facts which are clear and undeniable and which now stand records authentic in the history of our country when we of the south demanded the or the importation of africans the cultivation of our lands did they not yield the right twenty years when we asked ﬁfths representation in congress our slaves was it not granted when we asked and demanded the return of any fugitive from justice or the recovery of those persons owing labor or allegiance was it not incorporated in the constitution and again ratiﬁed and strengthened in the fugitive slave law of 1850

attendant perils and horrors that tests this passion and winnows from the masses those who with all their love of life still love their country more while your present position is most vivid and impressive illustration of patriotism it has glory peculiar and altogether its own the mercenary armies which have swept victoriously over the world and have gathered so many of the laurels that history has embalmed were but machines drafted into the service of ambitious spirits whom they obeyed and little understood or appreciated the problems their blood was poured out to solve but while you have all the dauntless physical courage which they displayed you add to it thorou gh knowledge of the argument on which this mighty movement proceeds and moral heroism which breaking away from the entanglements of kindred and friends and state policy enables you to follow your convictions of duty even though they should lead you up to the cannon mouth it must however be added that with elevation of position come corresponding responsibilities alike in the inactio n of the camp and amid the fatigues of the march and the charge and shouts of battle you will remember that you have in your keeping not only your own personal reputation but the honor of your native state and what is inﬁnitely more inspiring the honor of that and beneﬁcent republic whose children you are any

its blessings not miserably shrivelled and shattered thing charred by the ﬁres and torn by the tempests of revolution and all over polluted and scarred by the bloody poniards of traitors holt ccxcviii the american question in england citizens of carlyle i have endeavored to present to your view faithful picture of the religion and politics the objects and the aims of the rebel confederate states of america of those states that at this moment through their commissioned emissaries on this side the atlantic are seeking admission into the commonwealth of christian nations one of these accredited representatives is while i am speaking upon our shores and on the behalf of the object of these men some of our leading journals are daily writing laborious articles them our shipbuilders are constructing warlike vessels not to meet an equal foe in fair ﬁght but to plunder and destroy defenseless merchantmen engaged in the lawful and laudable trade of carrying the legitimate products of one country to the markets of another these men our capitalists are raising money that if possible they may render successful rebel slaveholders revolt which wickedness and infamy has parallel save in the impious rebellion of lucifer and his compeers yonder across the wide waste of waters four millions of helpless victims of the cruelty and lust of southern their fettered hands and imploringly inquire what part you will take in the conﬂict which involves their fate and that of their posterity whether you will give aid and comfort to their oppressors or whether you will send them words of sympathy and hope and give encouragement and support to the friends of freedom in the north who are nobly sacriﬁcing property and life their redemption what answer will you return to this appeal what think you is the duty of england in this contest between the north and the south of england whose heart was with the cause of the heroic black population of hayti when under the leadership of the immortal toussaint they were resisting unto blood in the cause of liberty the mercenary hordes of napoleon of england who with disinterested ardor fought the battle of the greeks against the turks of england who has so often raised her voice on behalf of bleeding crusaded denationalized poland who has welcomed in her cities and cherished in her homes the illustrious patriot louis kossuth whose best wishes and earnest prayers have ever attended the efforts in the cause of freedom of mazzini and garibaldi in what the struggles in which england has heretofore sympathized differ from that which is now convulsing america is it not contest between vile slaveholding oligarchy on the one hand and the upholders of free democratic institutions and the friends of emancipation on the other the only difference if difference there be is this that the consp irators against human rights in the south are ﬁghting objects immeasurably more base and more deeply stained with guilt than any which were ever sought by the crowned kings and despots of the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https world the confederate banditti of the south are ﬁghting what their avows is new government based upon the perpetual enslavement of the laboring class in conﬂict between liberty and slavery between free democratic government and the foulest despotism which the enemies of mankind ever conspired together to establish where should england stand on the side of two hundred and ﬁfty thousand traitors and tyrants or on the side of four millions of slaves england with her past history and glorious traditions england that extinguished the accursed slave trade and abolished colonial slavery whose cathedrals and council chamfers and market places are adorned with the statues of howard and wilberforce and clarkson and buxton and stur ge it may be granted that when the government of the north ﬁrst armed the defence of the national life it did not at once decree the universal abolition of slavery and i have given i think good and sufﬁcient reasons why it did not and could not the action of the president at the beginning was restricted to constitut ional objects those objects enforcement of the laws the suppression of local insurrection the reintegration of the disputed territory the protection of the capitol and its archives from the spoliating hands of traitors but the seat of government saved the president seated ﬁrmly in the chair the congress duly assembled and the machinery of the constitution set to work and then commenced and were carried out series of measures such were never before accomplished in the same space of time by any government in the world first we saw the national district purged from the pollution and shame of slavery then the prohibitio n of slavery forever in the vast territories of the northwest then the enforcement of the laws against the slave trade and the execution of gordon the slave trader then an offer of compensation to such slave states would adopt measures of emancipation then the recognition of the independence of the black republics of hayti and liberia and ﬁnally proclamation of freedom to all the slaves within the rebel states it was said of napoleon that he would go down to posterity with the code which bears his name in his hand it may be said of abraham lincoln that he will descend to future time holding in his hand the great charter of the negro rights his emancipation proclamation of january with such president at the head of such people engaged in such cause need i answer the questions i have so often put to you on which side should england be found in the great american struggle thompson ccxcix patriotism right and wrong justice and crime exist independently of our country public wrong is not private right any citizen the citizen is man bound to know and the right and the nation is but an aggregation of citizens if man should shout in the delirium of his dinner my country by whatever means extended and bounded my country right or wrong he merely repeats the words of the thief who steals in the streets or of the trader who swears falsely at the both of them chuckling my fortune however acquired thus gentlemen we see that man country is not certain area of mountains rivers and it is principle and patriotism is loyalty to that the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https poetic minds and in popular enthusiasm this feeling becomes closely associa ted with the soil and symbols of the country but the secret sanctiﬁcation of the soil and the symbol is the idea which they represent and this idea the patriot worships through the name and the symbol lover kisses with rapture the glove of his mistress and wears lock of her hair upon his heart so with passionate heroism of which tradition is never weary of tenderly telling arnold von winkelreid gathers into his bosom the sheaf of foreign spears that his death may give life to his country so nathan hale disdaining service that his country demands perishes untimely with other friend than god and the satisﬁed sense of duty so geor ge washington at once

it shall conspire with the great idea of liberty and not degrade and destroy it the theory of our institutions is our pride but it is pitiful truth that our public life has become synonymous with knavery if politician is introduced you feel of your pockets it is shameful that it is universally conceded that the best men the men of intelligence and probity generally avoid politics and that the word itself has come to mean something not to be touched without deﬁlement consequently what good men will not touch bad men will it is understood that bribery carries the election and the presidency is the result of an adroit proce ss of ﬁnancial engineering i have myself been shown handful of publicly display ed in the room of legislature and sagaciously told that is the logic legislators men think they can not afford to go to congress and send other men to their duties to the getting that we can have nothing without paying it and that if we hope to enjoy the best government in the world we must give time and labor each one of us and not suppose that the country will govern itself nor bad men govern it well remember that the greatness of our country is not in its achievement but in its promise which can not be fulﬁlled without that sovereign moral out sensitive national conscience if it were question of the mere daily pleasure of living the gratiﬁcation of taste opportunity of access to the great intellectual and æsthetic results of human genius and whatever embellishes human life man could hesitate moment between the fulness of foreign lands in these respects and the conspicuous poverty of our own what have we done we have subdued and settled vast domain we have made every inland river turn mill and wherever on the dim rim of the globe there is harbor we have lighted it with an american sail we have bound the atlantic to the mississippi so that we drift from the sea to the prairie upon cloud of vapor and we are stretching one hand across the continent to the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https hope of columbus in shorter way to cathay and with the other we are grasping under the sea to clasp there the hand of the old continent that so the throbbing of the ocean may not toss us further apart but be the beating of one common pulse of the world yet these are the results common to all national enterprise and different with us only in degree not in kind these are but the tools with which to shape destin commercial prosperity is only curse if it be not subservient to moral and intellectual progress and our prosperity will conquer us if we not conquer our prosperity curtis ccci ideas the life of people the leaders of our revolution were men of whom the simple truth is the ugliest praise of every condition in life they were singularly sagacious sober and thoughtful lord chatham spoke only the truth when he said to franklin of the men who composed the ﬁrst colonial congress the congress is the most honorable assembly of statesmen since those of the ancient greeks and romans in the most virtuous times given to grave reﬂection they were neither dreamers nor missionaries and they were much too earnest to be rhetoricians it is curious fact that they were generally men of so calm temper that they lived to extreme age with the exception of patrick henry and samuel adams they were most of them profound scholars and studied the history of mankind that they might know men they were so familiar with the lives and thoughts of the wisest and best minds of the past that classic aroma hangs about their writings and their speech and they were profoundly convinced of what statesmen always know and the adroitest mere politicians never ideas are the life of the conscience not the pocket is the real citadel of nation and that when you have debauched and demoralized that conscience by teaching that there are natural rights and that therefore there is moral right or wrong in political action you have poisoned the wells and rotted the crops in the ground the three greatest living statesmen of england knew this burke knew it and charles james fox and william pitt earl of chatham but they did not speak the king or parliament or the english nation lord gower spoke them when he said in parliament let the americans talk about their natural and divine rights their rights men and citizens their rights from god and nature i am enforcing these measures my lord was contemptuous and the king hired the hessians but the truth remained true the fathers saw the scarlet soldiers swarming over the sea but more steadily they saw that national progress had been secure only in the degree that the political system had conformed to natural justice they knew the coming wreck of property and trade but they knew more surely that rome was never so rich when she was dying and on the other hand the netherlands never so powerful when they were poorest farther away they read the names of assyria greece egypt they had art opulence splendor corn enough grew in the valley of the nile the syrian sword was sharp any they were merchant princes and the clouds in the sky were rivalled by their sails upon the sea they were soldiers and their frown frightened the world soul take thine ease those empires said languid with excess of luxury and life yes but you remember the king who had built his grandest palace and was to occupy it upon the morrow but when the morrow came the palace was pile of ruins woe is cried the king who is guilty of this crime there is crime replied the sage at his side but the mortar was made of sand and water only and the builders forgot to put in the lime the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https fell the old empires because the governors forgot to put justice into their governments curtis cccii the same concluded these things our fathers saw and pondered i not mean that when the writs of assistance were issued or the stamp act proposed or port bill passed they did not oppose them upon technical and legal grounds undoubtedly they did but their character and habits and studies were such that the tyranny encroached they rose naturally into the sphere of fundamental truths into purer and native air in great crises men always revert to ﬁrst principles in sailing out of sight of land the mariner consults celestial laws so the fathers began at the beginning with god and human nature and derived their government from truths which they disdained to prove asserting them to be thus the revolution was not the struggle of class only but of people it was not merely the rebellion of subjects whose pockets were threatened it was the protest of men whose instincts had been outraged webster was fond of saying it was fought on preamble tax on tea or paper was not the cause it was only the occasion of the revolution the spirit which fought the desperate and disastrous battle on long island yonder was not spirit which could be quieted by the promise of sugar gratis the chance of success was penalty of failure was sure but they believed in god they kissed wife and child left them in his hand and kept their powder dry then to valley forge the valley of the shadow of feet bleeding upon the sharp hunger thirst and cold dogging their ghastly death waiting them in the snow they bore that faith in ideas which brought their fathers over pitiless sea to pitiless shore ideas were their food ideas were their coats and they knew that their ranks were thin and raw and the enemy trained and many but they knew also that the only difﬁculty with the proverb that god ﬁghts upon the side of the strongest battalions is that it is not true if you load muskets with bullets only the result is simply question of numbers but one gun loaded with an idea is more fatal than the muskets of whole regiment bullet kills tyrant but an idea kills tyranny what chance have thousand men ﬁghting sixpence day against hundred ﬁghting life and liberty home and native land in such hands the weapons themselves feel and think and so the family ﬁrelocks and rusty swords the pistol and old scythes of our fathers thought

quarter or half century its accomplishment has become the announced edict of the loyal people of the united states within the space of months the abolishment of the slave trade by the british government initiated by wilberforce supported by pitt and fox and burke and granville was accomplished only after seventeen years of parliamentary agitation when fox in 1806 submitted this which proved to be the last motion he ever made in parliament and lived to witness its success nobly did he declare that if during the forty years he had sat in parliament he had been so fortunate to accomplish that object and that only he should think he had done enou gh if fox might take to his heart that gratulation over the ﬁrst sanction extorted from the legislature of great britain the

generations to defray the expenses of defending the government against traitors and we forbear to touch even the property of the authors of these calamities whose persons are beyond our reach suppose ye that the loyal people of this country will submit to such injustice the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https believe i represent loyal patrioti c and brave constituency any other senator i claim nothing more while i am proud of the part which the soldiers of my own state took in defeating the enemy in the west i not claim them any superiority over the other soldiers of the republic the brave men who besieged donelson and who after ﬁghting through the day three consecutive days lay each night on the ground without shelter exposed to the rain and sleet were chieﬂy illinoisans it was there that rebellion received the heavy blow which has staggered it ever since forty dead bodies were borne from that bloody ﬁeld to one small town in my state and buried in common grave the union forces at pea ridge were also largely made up of soldiers from illinois suppose ye that i can go back to illinois among the relatives of those who have been cruelly destroyed and propose to levy taxes upon them in order to conciliate and compensate the murderers that is really what exempting rebel property from conﬁscation amounts to sir i know not if they would submit to such injustice and yet there are those who not only talk of an amnesty to the men who have brought these troubles upon the country but oppose providing the mild punishment of conﬁscation of property those who shall continue hereafter to war upon the government and whose persons are beyond our reach gentlemen regard it conciliatory to oblige us to lay taxes upon those whose habitations have been consumed to reward those who have burned them upon those whose whole property has been stolen to reward the thieves upon those whose relatives have been slain to compensate the murderers in my judgment justice humanity and mercy herself all demand that we at once provide that the supporters of this cruel and wicked rebellion should henceforth be made to feel its burdens when the rebels whose hands are dripping with the blood of loyal citizens shall have grounded their arms it will be time enough to talk of clemency but to have our sympathies excited in their behalf now when ﬁghting

things and what have they been from the beginning they have been propositions of compromis and senators have spoken of peace and of the horrors of civil war and gentlemen who have contended the right of the people of the territories to regulate their own affairs and who have been horriﬁed at the idea of geographical line dividing free states from slave states free territory from slave territory we have proclaimed that the great principle upon which the revolution was fought was that of the right of the people to govern themselves and that it was monstrous doctrine congress to interfere in any way with its own gentlemen come forward here with propositions to divide the country on geographical line and not only that but to establish slavery south of the line and they call this the missouri compromise the proposition known the crittenden compromise is more like the missouri compromise than is the gove rnment of turkey like that of the united states the missouri compromise was law declaring that in all the territory which we had acquired from louisiana north of certain line of latitude slavery or involuntary servitud should never exist but it said nothing about the establishment of slavery south of that line it was compromise made in order to admit missouri into the union slave state in that the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https consideration the exclusion of slavery from all the country north of 30 now sir i have objection to the restoration of the missouri compromise it stood in 1854 when the bill repealed it the proposition known the crittenden compromise declares not only that in the territory south of the said line of latitude slavery of the african race is thereby recognized existing and shall not be interfered with by congress but it provides further that in the territory we shall hereafter acquire south of that line slavery shall be recognized and not interfered with by congress but shall be protected property by all the departments of the territorial government during its continuance so that if we make acquisitions on the south of territories now free and where by the laws of the land the footsteps of slavery have never been the moment we acquire jurisdiction over them the moment the stars and stripes of the republic ﬂoat over those free territories they carry with them african slavery establish ed beyond the power of congress and beyond the power of any territorial legislature or of the people to keep it out and we are told that this is the missouri compromise now sir why can not we have peace i ask upon the compromise measures of 1850 why disturb them they were enacted by great men they gave peace to the country why is it necessary now to overturn them resto re the old missouri compromise it stood let us go back to the settlement made in 1850 and there let us stand what more would senators have the south were satisﬁed with that settlement have we disturbed it are we proposing to disturb it not at all you yourselves disturbed it and brought these difﬁculties upon the country i have always insisted that the people of the northern states were in manne r responsible slavery in the southern states and why because they had power in regard to it each state has right to manage its own domestic affairs i will not interfere with it where i have authority by the constitution to interfere but i will never consent the people of my state will never consent the people of the great northwest numbering more in white population than all your southern states together never will consent by their act to establish african slavery anywhere sir i will never agree to put into the constitution of the country clause establishing or making perpetual slavery anywhere sir human being shall ever be made slave by my vote not one single foot of god soil shall ever be dedicated to african slavery by my never trumbull cccxvi reply to senator breckinridge the senator from kentucky stands up here in opposition to what he sees is the overwhelming sentiment of the senate and utters reproof malediction and prediction combined i would ask him sir what would you havre us to rebel army within twenty mites of us advancing or threatening to advance to destroy your government will the senator yield to rebellion will he shrink from armed insurrection will his state justify it will its better public opinion allow it shall we send ﬂag of truce what would he have or would he conduct this war so feebly that the whole world would smile at us in derision what

treason even in the very capitol of the confederacy be with the enemy or with us i come then to emancipation and ﬁrst i ask my countrymen to proclaim emancipation to the slaves matter of necessity to ourselves unless it be by accident we are not to come out of this contest one nation except by emancipation conﬁscation of the property of the rebels may be necessary and just but it is not enough it will not save us in this rugged and awful crisis it is inadequate to meet the exigency in which the country is placed we must have emancipation the political salvation of the country demands it and it is inevitable the time is approaching when emancipation must take place and we have now i think only choice of ways emancipation may be achieved by the slaves themselves it may be effected by the government of the united states it may come through the desperation of the slaveholding rebels themselves but come it must i say then let us at the head of our armies on the soil of south carolina proclaim freedom to all her slaves and then enforce the proclamation far and fast we have opportunity let the blow fall ﬁrst on that state which ﬁrst rebelled warning and penalty her perﬁdy in this business which began at the moment that her delegates penned their names to the constitution next florida impotent in her treachery with less than hundred and ﬁfty thousand inhabitants and with property not equal to that of single ward in this city and that purchased with the money of the people her slaves and invite the refugees from slavery in the south the moment to assemble there if they desire and take possession of the soil and next in this work of emancipation i name texas state purchased by costly war with mexico and which went out of the union because she could not extend slavery in the union let us teach her people that in the union or out of the union slavery is not to be extended emancipate the slaves in texas and invite men from the army invite men from the north invite men from ireland invite men from germany friends of freedom of every name and every nation them welcome to the millions of acres of fertile lands we shall there conﬁscate and they will form barrier of freemen wall of liberty over which or through which or beneath which it will be impossible slavery to extend itself these three states may be sufﬁcient warning refuge and security against the spread of slavery but i would have it distinctly understood that by the next anniversary of the birth of the father of his country we shall emancipate the slaves in all the disloyal and rebellious states if they not previously return to their allegiance but justice to the slaves less than necessity to us demands emancipation certainly they have been subjected to sufﬁcient apprenticeship under slavery through two centuries to prepare them freedom if ever they are to be prepared i say then justice to the slave demands emancipation let us maintain the principles of the declaration of independence the fundamental difference on which the north and south have divided thirty years is on that part of the declaration which says all men are created equal they have denied it we have undertaken to maintain it jefferson meant when he penned that immortal truth not that men are equal physically intellectually or morally but that one is born under any the project gutenberg ebook of the american union speaker by john philbrick https to his fellow man let us maintain the doctrine now these slaves are men jefferson did not hesitate to call them brethren the declaration concerning the equality of men applies to them to us and now that in the progress of events the south has relieved us from responsibility in regard to eleven disloyal states let us stand forth nation in our original strength and purity maintaining the ideas to which our fathers gave utterance that we may have ground on which to stand and defend ourselves in this contest let us declare in the presence of these slaveholders and rebels in the presence of europe that we proclaim the equality of all men boutwell cccxviii the reconstruction of louisiana president and the request of the committee of arrange ments i am present

is not drinkable or the law says how can we think what is not thinkable therefore my lord we are counsel in this cause the bull if the jury should bring the bull in guilty the jury would be guilty of bull the counsel the boat observed that the bull should be because in his declaration he had not speciﬁed what color he was of thus wisely and thus learnedly spoke the counsel my lord if the bull was of color he must be of some color and if he was not of any color what color could the bull be of i overruled this motion myself by observing the bull was white bull and that white is color besides i told my brethren they should not trouble their heads to talk of color t in law the law can color anything this cause being afterwards left to reference upon the award both bull and boat were acquitted
