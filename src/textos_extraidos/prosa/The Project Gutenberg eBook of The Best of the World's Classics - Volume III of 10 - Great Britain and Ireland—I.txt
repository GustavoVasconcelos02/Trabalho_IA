attributed to him are now considered spurious of acquiring and using riches 16 when prudence had heard her husband avaunt himself of his riches and of his money disparaging the power of his adversaries she spake and said in this wise certes dear sir i grant you that ye are rich and mighty and that riches are good to that have well obtained and that well can use just the body of man may not live without soul more may it live without temporal goods and by riches may man get him great friends and therefore saith pamphilus if neatherd daughter be rich she may chose of thousand men which she will take to her husband of thousand men one will not forsake her nor refuse her and this pamphilus saith also if thou be right happy that is to say if thou be right rich thou shalt ﬁnd great number of fellows and friends and if thy fortune change that thou wax poor farewell friendship and fellowship thou shalt be all alone without any company except it be the company of poor folk and yet saith this pamphilus moreover that they that are bond and thrall of linage should be made worthy and noble by riches and just by riches there come many goods so by poverty come there many harms and evils and therefore says cassiodore 17 poverty the mother of ruin that is to say the mother of overthrowing or falling down and therefore saith piers alphonse one of the greatest adversities of the world is when free man by kind or of birth is constrained by poverty to eat the alms of his enemy and the same saith innocent in one of his books he saith that sorrowful and mishappy is the condition of poor beggar if he asks not his meat he dieth of hunger and if he ask he dieth shame and dire necessity constraineth him to ask and therefore saith solomon that better it is to die than to have such poverty and the same solomon saith better it is to die of bitter death than to live in such wise by these reasons that i have said unto you and by many other reasons that i could say i grant you that riches are good to that well obtained them and to him that well uses riches and therefore will i shew you how ye should behave you in gathering of your riches and in what manner ye should use first ye should get without great desire by good leisure patiently and not over hastily man that is too desiring to get riches abandoneth him ﬁrst to theft and to all other evils and therefore saith solomon he that hasteth him too busily to wax rich he shall be not innocent he saith also that the riches that hastily cometh to man soon lightly goeth and passeth from man but that riches that cometh little and little waxeth alway and multiplieth and sir ye should get riches by your wit and by your travail unto your proﬁt and that without wrong or harm doing to any other person the law saith there maketh man himself rich if he harm to another wight that is to say that nature defendeth and forbiddeth by right that man make himself rich unto the harm of another person and tullius 18 saith that sorrow dread of death nothing that may fall unto man is so much against nature man to increase his owyn proﬁt to harm of another man and though the great men and the mighty men get riches more lightly than thou yet shalt thou not be idle nor slow to thy proﬁt thou shalt in all wise ﬂee idleness solomon saith that idleness teacheth man to many evils and the same solomon saith that he that travaileth and busieth himself to till his land shall eat bread but he that is idle and casteth him to business nor occupation shall fall into poverty and die hunger and he that is idle and slow can never ﬁnd convenient time to his proﬁt there is versiﬁer who saith that the idle man excuseth him in winter because of the great cold and in summer then by reason of the heat 18 19 20 the project gutenberg

vices and therefore saith jerome some good deeds that the devil which is our enemy ﬁnd you not unoccupied the devil he taketh not lightly unto his working such he ﬁndeth occupied in good works then thus in getting riches ye must ﬂee idleness and afterward ye should use the riches which ye have got by your wit and by your travail in such manner that men hold you not too scarce nor too sparing nor ge that is to say over large spender right men blame an avaricious man because of his scarcity and niggardliness in the same wise he is to blame that spendeth over largely and therefore saith cato use saith he the riches that thou hast obtained in such manner that men have matter nor cause to call thee neither wretch nor miser it is great shame to man to have poor heart and rich purse he saith also the goods that thou hast obtained use by measure that is to say spend measurably they that foolishly waste and squander the goods that they have when they have more proper of own that they prepare to take the goods of another man i say then that ye should ﬂee avarice using your riches in such manner that men say not that your riches are buried but that ye have in your might and in your wielding wise man reproveth the avaricious man and saith thus in two verse whereto and why burieth man his goods by his great avarice and knoweth well that needs must he die death is the end of every man in this present life and what cause or reason joineth he him or knitteth he him so fast unto his goods that all his wits will not dissever him or depart him from his goods and knoweth well or ought to know that when he is dead he shall nothing bear with him out of this world and therefore saith augustine that the avaricious man is likened unto hell that the more it swalloweth the more desire it hath to swallow and devour and well ye would eschew to be called an avaricious man or chinch well should ye keep you and govern you in such wise that men call you not ge therefore saith tullius the goods of thine house should not be hid nor kept so close but that they might be opened by pity and debonnairety that is to say to give part that have great need but the goods should not be so open to

to be wise and proved before he be made knight it behoveth him that he had long time used the war and arms that he may be expert and wise to govern others since knight is captain of battle the life of them that shall be under him lieth in his hand and therefore behooveth him to be wise and well advised sometimes art craft and engine is more worth than strength of hardiness of man that is not proved in arms otherwhile it happeneth that when the prince of the battle relies on and trusteth in his hardiness and strength and will not use wisdom and engine to run upon his enemies he is vanquished and his people slain therefore saith the philosopher that man should choose young people to be captains and governors forasmuch there is certainty in their wisdom alexander of macedon vanquished and conquered egypt judæa chaldee africa and assyria unto the marches of bragmans more by the counsel of old men than by the strength of the young men the very true love of the common weal and proﬁt is seldom found where shalt thou ﬁnd man in these days that will expose himself the worship and honor of his friend or the common weal seldom or never shall he be found also the knights should be large and liberal when knight hath regard unto his singular proﬁt by his covetousness he despoileth his people when the soldiers see that they put them in peril and their master will not pay them their wages liberally but intendeth to his own proper gain and proﬁt then when the enemies come they turn soon their backs and ﬂee oftentimes and thus it happeneth by him that intendeth more to get money than victory that his avarice is ofttimes cause of his confusion then let every knight take heed to be liberal in such wise that he ween not nor suppose that his scarcity be to him great winning or gain and this cause he be the less loved of his people and that his adversary withdraw to him them by large giving ofttime battle is advanced more getting of silver than by the force and strength of men men see all day that such things may not be achieved by force of nature be gotten and achieved by force of money and forsomuch it behooveth to see well to that when the time of battle cometh that he borrow not nor make curtailment man may be rich that leaveth his own hoping to get and take of others then alway all their gain and winning ought to be common among them except their arms in like wise the victory is common so should the despoil and booty be common unto them and therefore david that gentle knight in the ﬁrst book of kings in the last chapter made law that he that abode behind by malady or sickness in the tents should have much part of the booty he that had been in the battle and the love of this law he was made afterward king of israel alexander of macedon came in time like simple knight unto the court of porus king of ind to espy the estate of the king and of the knights of the court and the king received him right worshipfully and demanded many things of alexander

answered sir king my lord i pray thee to understand and take heed thyself and also thy knights i have heard much of thy great highness and that thou art more mighty and puissant in chivalry and in dispences than is alexander and therefore i am come to thee poor knight which am named antigone to serve thee then it is the custom in the court of alexander that what thing knight is served with all is his meat and vessel and cup and theref ore i had supposed that this custom had been kept in thy court thou art richer than he when the knights heard this anon they left porus and went to serve alexander and thus he drew to him the hearts of them by gifts which afterward slew porus that was king of ind and they made alexander king thereof therefore remember knight alway that with closed and

it over he is superior it is prince part to pardon and solomon i am sure saith it is the glory of man to pass by an offense that which is past is gone and irrevocable and wise men have enough to with things present and to come therefore they but triﬂe with themselves that labor in past matters there is man doth wrong the wrong sake but thereby to purchase himself proﬁt or pleasure or honor or the like therefore why should i be angry with man loving himself better than and if any man should wrong merely out of ure why yet it is but like the thorn or brier which prick and scratch because they can other the most tolerable sort of revenge is those wrongs which there is law to remedy but then let man take heed the revenge be such there is law to punish else man enemy is still beforehand and

account future times impertinen ces nay there are some other that account wife and children but bills of charges nay more there are some foolish rich covetous men that take pride in having children because they may be thought so much the richer perhaps they have heard some talk such an one is great rich man and another except to it yea but he hath great charge of childr en if it were an abatement to his riches but the most ordinary cause of single life is liberty especially in certain and humorous minds which are so sensible of every restraint they will go near to think their girdles and garters to be bonds and shackles unmarried men are best friends best masters best servants but not always best subjects they are light to run away and almost all fugitives are of that condition single life doth well with churchmen charity will hardly water the ground where it must ﬁrst ﬁll pool it is indifferent judges and magistrates if they be facile and corrupt you shall have servant ﬁve

yet he was reputed one of the wise men that made answer to the question when man should young man not yet an elder man not at all it is often seen that bad husbands have very good wives whether it be that it raiseth the price of their husband kindness when it comes or that the wives take pride in their patience but this never fails if the bad husbands were of their own choosing against their friends consent then they will be sure to make good their own folly vi of envy there be none of the affections which have been noted to fascinate or bewitch but love and envy they both have vehement wishes they frame themselves readily into imaginations and suggestions and they come easily into the eye especially upon the presence of the objects which are the points that conduce to fascination if any such thing there be we see likewise the scripture calleth envy an evil eye and the astrologers call the evil inﬂuences of the stars evil aspects so that still there seemeth to be acknowledged in the act of envy an ejaculation or irradiation of the eye nay some have been so curious to note that the times when the stroke or percussion of an envious eye doth most hurt are when the party envied is beheld in glory or triumph that sets an edge upon envy and besides at such times the spirits of the person envied come forth most into the outward parts and so meet the blow 66 67 68 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https leaving these curiosities tho not unworthy to be thought on in ﬁt place we will handle what persons are apt to envy others what persons are most subject to be envied themselves and what is the dif ference between public and private envy man that hath virtue in himself ever envieth virtue in others men minds will either feed upon their own good or upon others evil and who wanteth the one will prey upon the other and whoso is out of hope to attain to another virtue will seek to come at even hand by depressing another fortune man that is busy and inquisitive is commonly envious to know much of other men matters can not be because all that ado may concern his own estate therefore it must needs be that he taketh kind of in looking upon the fortunes of others neither can he that mindeth but his own business ﬁnd much matter envy envy is gadding passion and walketh the streets and doth not keep home non est curiosus guin idem sit malevolus 41 men of noble birth are noted to be envious towards new men when they rise the distance is altered and it is like deceit of the eye that when others come on they think themselves go back deformed persons and eunuchs and old men and bastards are envious he that can not possibly mend his own case will what he can to impair another except these defects light upon very brave and heroical nature which thinketh to make his natural wants part of his honor in that it should be said that an eunuch or lame man did such great matters affecting the honor of miracle it was in narses 42 the eunuch and agesilaus 43 and tamberlanes 44 that were lame men the same is the case of men that rise after calamities and misfortunes they are men fallen out with the times and think other men harms redemption of their own sufferings they that desire to excel in too many matters out of levity and vainglory are ever envious they can not want work it being impossible but many in some one of those things should surpass them which was the character of adrian 45 the emperor that mortally envied poets and painters and artiﬁcers in works wherein he had vein to excel lastly near kinsfolks and fellows in ofﬁce and those that have been bred together are more apt to envy their equals when they are raised it doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes and pointeth at them and cometh oftener into their remembrance and incurreth likewise more into the note of others and envy ever redoubleth from speech and fame cain envy was the more vile and malignant towards his brother abel because when his sacriﬁce was better accepted there was body to look on thus much those that are apt to envy concerning those that are more or less subject to envy first persons of emine nt virtue when they are advanced are less envied their fortune seemeth but due unto them and man envieth the payment of debt but rewards and liberality rather again envy is ever joined with the comparing of man self and where there is comparison envy and therefore kings are not envied but by kings nevertheless it is to be noted that unworthy persons are most envied at their ﬁrst coming in and afterwards overcome it better whereas contrariwise persons of worth and merit are most envied when their fortune continueth long by that time tho their virtue be the same yet it hath not the same luster fresh men grow up that darken it persons of noble blood are less envied in their rising it seemeth but right done to their birth besides there seemeth not much added to their fortune and envy is the sunbeams that beat hotter upon bank or steep rising ground than up ﬂat and the same reason those that are advanced by degrees are less envied than those that are advanced suddenly and per saltum at bound 69 70 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https that have joined with their honor great travels cares or perils are less subject to envy men think that they earn their honors hardly and pity them sometimes and pity ever healeth envy wherefore you shall observe that the more deep and sober sort of politic persons in their greatness are ever bemoaning themselves what life they lead chanting quanta patimur not that they feel it so but only to abate the edge of envy but this is to be understood of business that is laid upon men and not such they call unto themselves nothing increaseth envy more than an unnecessary and ambitious engrossing of business and nothing doth extinguish envy more than great person to preserve all other inferior ofﬁcers in their full rights and preeminences of their places by that means there be so many screens between him and envy above all those are most subject to envy which carry the greatness of their fortunes in an insolent and proud manner being never well but while they are showing how great they are either by outward pomp or by triumphing over all opposition or competition whereas wise men will rather sacriﬁce to envy in suffering themselves sometimes of purpose to be crossed and overborne in things that not much concern them notwithstanding so much is true that the carriage of greatness in plain and open manner so it be without arrogancy and vain glory doth draw less envy than if it be in more crafty and cunning fashion in that course man doth but disavow fortune and seemeth to be conscious of his own want in worth and doth but teach others to envy him lastly to conclude this part we said in the beginning that the act of envy had somewhat in it of witchcraft so there is other cure of envy but the cure of witchcraft and that is to remove the lot they call it and to lay it upon another which purpose the wiser sort of great persons bring in ever upon the stage somebody upon whom to derive the envy that would come upon themselves sometimes upon ministers and servants sometimes upon colleagues and associates and the like and that turn there are never wanting some persons of violent and undertaking nature who so they may have power and business will take it at any cost now to speak of public envy there is yet some good in public envy whereas in private there is none public envy is an ostracism that eclipseth men when they grow too great and therefore it is bridle also to great ones to keep them within bounds this envy being in the latin word invidia goeth in the modern languages by the name of discontentment of which we shall speak in handling sedition it is disease in state like to infection infection spreadeth upon that which is sound and tainteth it so when envy is gotten once into state it traduceth even the best actions thereof and turneth them into an ill odor and therefore there is little won by intermingling of plausible actions that doth argue but weakness and fear of envy which hurteth so much the more it is likewise usual in infections which if you fear them you call them upon you this public envy seemeth to beat chieﬂy upon principal ofﬁcers or ministers rather than upon kings and estates themselves but this is sure rule that if the envy upon the minister be great when the cause of it in him is small or if the envy be general in manner upon all the ministers of an estate then the envy tho hidden is truly upon the state itself and so much of public envy or discontentment and the difference thereof from private envy which was handled in the ﬁrst place we will add this in general touching the affection of envy that of all other affections it is the most importune and continual of other affections there is occasion given but now and then and therefore it was well said invidia festos dies non agit 46 it is ever working upon some or other and it is also noted that love and envy make man pine which other affections not because they are not so continual it is also the vilest affection and the most depraved which cause it is the proper attribute of the devil who is called the envious man that soweth tares amongst the wheat by night it always cometh to pass that envy worketh subtilly and in the dark and to the prejudice of good things such is the wheat 71 72 73 the

is more than any hawk you have named and more watchful and timorous than your merlin is bold and yet i doubt not to catch brace or two friend breakfast doubt not therefore sir but that angling is an art and an art worth your learning the question is rather whether you be capable of learning it angling is somewhat like are to be born so i mean with inclinations to it tho both may be heightened by discourse and practise but he that hopes to be good angler must not only bring an inquiring searching observing wit but he must bring large measure of hope and patience and love and propensity to the art itself but having once got and practised it then doubt not but angling will prove to be so pleasant that it will prove to be like virtue reward to itself venator i am now become so full of expectation that i long much to have you proceed and in the order you propose piscator ﬁrst the antiquity of angling of which i shall not say much but only this some say it is ancient deucalion ﬂood 59 others that belus 60 who was the ﬁrst inventor of godly and virtuous recreations was the ﬁrst inventor of angling and some others former times have had their disquisitions about the antiquity of that seth one of the sons of adam taught it to his sons and that by them it was derived to posterity others say that he left it engraven on those pillars which he erected and trusted to preserve the knowledge of the mathematics music and the rest of that precious knowledge and those useful arts which by god appointment or allowance and his noble industry were thereby preserved from perishing in noah ﬂood these sir have been the opinions of several men that have possibly endeavored to make angling more ancient than is needful or may well be warranted but my part i shall content myself in telling you that angling is much more ancient than the incarnation of our savior in the prophet amos mention is made of and in the book of job which was long before the days of that book is said to be writ by moses is made also of which must imply anglers in those times but my worthy friend i would rather prove myself gentleman by being learned and humble valiant and inoffensive virtuous and communicable than by any fond ostentation of riches or wanting those virtues myself boast that these were in my ancestors and yet i grant that where noble and ancient descent and such merit meet in any man it is double digniﬁcation of that person if this antiquity of angling which my part i have not forced shall like an ancient family be either an honor or an ornament to this virtuous art which i profess to love and practise i shall be the gladder that i made an accidental mention of the antiquity of it of which i shall say more but proceed to that just commendation which i think it deserves and that i shall tell you that in ancient times debate hath arisen and it remains yet unresolved whether the happiness of man in this world doth consist more in contemplation or action concerning which some have endeavored to maintain their opinion of the ﬁrst by saying that the nearer we mortals come to god by way of imitation the more happy we are and they say that god enjoys himself only by contemplation of his own inﬁniteness eternity power and goodness and the like and upon this ground many cloisteral men of great learning and devotion prefer contemplation before action and many of the fathers seem to approve this opinion may appear in their commentaries upon the words of our savior to martha luke x 41 42 93 94 95 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https on the contrary there want not men of equal authority and credit that prefer action to be the more excellent namely experiments in physic and the application of it both the ease and prolongation of man life by which each man is enabled to act and good to others either to serve his country or good to particular persons and they say also that action is doctrinal and teaches both art and virtue and is maintainer of human society and these and other like reasons to be preferred before contemplation concerning which two opinions i shall forbear to add third by declaring my own and rest myself contented in telling you my very worthy friend that both these meet together and most properly belong to the most honest ingenious quiet and harmless art of angling and ﬁrst i shall tell you what some have observed and i have found it to be real that the very sitting by the river side is not only the quietest and ﬁttest place contemplation but will invite an angler to it and this seems to be maintained by the learned peter du moulin who in his discourse on the fulﬁlling of prophecies observes that when god intended to reveal any future events or high notions to his prophets he then carried them either to the deserts or the that having so separated them from amidst the press of people and business and the cares of the world he might settle their mind in quiet repose and there make them ﬁt revelation ii of the trout 61 the trout is ﬁsh highly valued both in this and foreign nations he may be justly said the old poet said of wine and we english say of venison to be generous ﬁsh ﬁsh that is so like the buck that he also has his seasons it is observed that he comes in and goes out of season with the stag and buck gesner says his name is of german offspring and says he is ﬁsh that feeds clean and purely in the swiftest streams and on the hardest gravel and that he may justly contend with all ﬁsh the mullet may with all precedency and daintiness of taste and that being in right season the most dainty palates have allowed precedency to him and before i go further in my discourse let tell you that you are to observe that there be some barren does that are good in summer so there be some barren trouts that are good in winter but there are not many that are so usually they be in their perfection in the month of may and decline with the buck now you are to take notice that in several countries in germany and in other parts compared to ours ﬁsh differ much in their bigness and shape and other ways and so trouts it is well known that in lake leman the lake of geneva there are trouts taken of three cubits long is afﬁrmed by gesner writer of good credit and mercator says the trouts that are taken in the lake of geneva are great part of the merchandise of that famous city and you are further to know that there be certain waters that breed trouts remarkable both their number and smallness i know little brook in kent that breeds them to number incredible and you may take them twenty or forty in an hour but none greater than about the size of gudgeon there are also in divers rivers especially that relate to or be near to the sea winchester or the thames about windsor little trout called samlet or skegger trout in both which places i have caught twenty or forty at standing that will bite fast and freely minnows these be by some taken to be young salmon but in those waters they never grow to be bigger than herring there is also in kent near to canterbury trout called there fordidge trout trout that bears the name of the town where it is usually caught that is accounted the rarest of ﬁsh many of them near the bigness of salmon but known by their different color and in 96 97 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https best season they cut very white and none of these have been known to be caught with an angle unless it were one that was caught by sir geor ge hastings an excellent angler and now with god and he hath told he thought that trout bit not hunger but wantonness and it is rather to be believed because both he then and many others before him have been curious to search into their bellies what the food was by which they lived and have found out nothing by which they might satisfy their curiosity concerning which you are to take notice that it is reported by good authors that grasshoppers and some ﬁsh have mouths but are nourished and take breath by the porousness of their gills man knows not how and this may be believed if we consider that when the raven hath hatched her eggs she takes further care but leaves her young ones to the care of the god of nature who is said in the psalms to feed the young ravens that call upon him and they be kept alive and fed by dew or worms that breed in their nests or some other ways that we mortals know not and this may be believed of the fordidge trout which it is said of the stork jerem viii 7 that he knows his season so he knows his times i think almost his day of coming into the river out of the sea where he lives and it is like feeds nine months of the year and fasts three in the river of fordidge and you are to note that those townsmen are very punctual in observing the time of beginning to ﬁsh them and boast much that their river affords trout that exceeds all others and just so does sussex boast of several ﬁsh namely shelsey cockle chichester lobster an arundel mullet and an amerly trout and now some conﬁrmation of the fordidge trout you are to know that this trout is thought to eat nothing in the fresh water and it may be better believed because it is well known that swallows and bats and wagtails which are called birds and not seen to ﬂy in england six months in the year but about michaelmas leave us better climate than this yet some of them that have been left behind their fellows have been found many thousands at time in hollow trees or clay caves where they have been observed to live and sleep out the whole winter without meat and so albertus observes that there is one kind of frog that hath her mouth naturally shut up about the end of august and that she lives so all the winter and tho it be strange to some yet it is known to too many among us to be doubted and so much these fordidge trouts which never afford an angler sport but either live their time of being in the fresh water by their meat formerly got in the sea not unlike the swallow or frog or by the virtue of the fresh water only or the birds of paradise and the chameleon are said to live by the sun and the air there is also in northumberland trout called bull trout of much greater length and bigness than any in the southern parts and there are in many rivers that relate to the sea salmon trouts much different from others both in shape and in their spots we see sheep in some countries differ one from another in their shape and bigness and in the ﬁneness of their wool and certainly some pastures breed larger sheep so some rivers by reason of the ground over which they run breed lar ger trouts now the next thing that i will commen d to your consideration is that the trout is of more sudden growth than other ﬁsh concerning which you are also to take notice that he lives not so long the perch and divers other ﬁshes sir francis bacon hath observed in his history of life and death 62 and now you are to take notice that he is not like the crocodile which if he lives never so long yet always thrives till his death and you are to know that he will about especially before the time of his spawning get almost miraculously through weirs and against the streams even through such high and swift places is almost incredible next that the trout usually spawns about october or november but in some rivers little sooner or later which is the more observable because most other ﬁsh spawn in the spring or summer when the sun hath warmed both the earth and the water and made it ﬁt generation and you are to note that he continues many months out of season it may be observed of the trout that he is like the buck or the ox that he will not be fat in many months tho he go in the very same pasture that horses which will 98 99 100 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https fat in one month and so you may observe that most other ﬁshes recover strength and grow sooner far and in season than the trout doth and next you are to note that till the sun gets to such height to warm the earth and the water the trout is sick and lean and lousy and unwholesome you shall in winter ﬁnd him to have big head and then to be lank and thin and lean at which time many of them have sticking on them sugs or which is kind of worm in shape like clove or pin with big head and sticks close to him and sucks his moisture those i think the trout breeds himself and never thrives till he frees himself from them whic h is when warm weather comes and then he grows stronger he gets from the dead still water into the sharp streams and the gravel and there tubs off these worms or lice and then he grows stronger so he gets him into swifter and swifter streams and there lies at the watch any ﬂy or minnow that comes near to him and he especially loves the which is bred of the or caddis and these make the trout bold and lusty and he is usually fatter and better meat at the end of that month may than at any time of the year iii the dea th of george herber t 63 at the time of duncon leaving was about three weeks before his old and dear friend woodnot came from london to bemerton and never left him till he had seen him draw his last breath and closed his eyes on his bed in this time of his decay he was

perfect dwell where these eyes shall see my master and savior jesus and with him see my dear mother and all my relations and friends but i must die or not come to that happy place and this is my

his princely and royal virtues he was if ever any the most worthy of the title of an honest man so great lover of justice that temptation could dispose him to wrongful action except it was so disguised to him that he believed it to be just he had tenderness and compassion of nature which restrained him from ever doing thing and therefo re he was so apt to grant pardon to malefactors that the judges of the land represented to him the damage and insecurity to the public that ﬂowed from such his indulgence and then he restrained himself from pardon ing either murders or highway robberies and quickly discerned the fruits of his severity by wonderful reformation of those enormities he was very punctual and regular in his devotions he was never known to enter upon his recreations or

private cabinet devotions and was so severe an exacter of gravity and reverence in all mention of religion that he could never endure any light or profane word with what sharpness of wit soever it was

prosecute those scandalous vices in the ecclesiastical courts agains t persons of eminence and near relation to his service his kingly virtues had some mixture and allay that hindered them from shining in full luster and from producing those fruits they should have been attended with he was not in his nature very bountiful tho he gave very much this appeared more after the duke of buckingham

which the stubbornness of men humors made dilatory in courts of justice he was very fearless in his person but in his riper years not very enterprising he had an excellent understanding but was not conﬁdent enough of it which made him oftentimes change his own opinion worse and follow the advice of men that did not judge so well himself this made him more irresolute than the conjuncture of his affairs would admit if he had been of rougher and more imperious nature he would have found more respect and duty and his not applying some severe cures to approaching evils proceeded from the lenity of his nature and the tenderness of his conscience which in all cases of blood made him choose the softer way and not hearken to severe counsels how reasonable soever urged this only restrained him from pursuing his advantage 145 146 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https he excelled in all other virtues so in temperance he was so

nor did he in some days after appear before him so many miraculous circumstances contributed to his ruin that men might well think that heaven and earth conspired it tho he was from the ﬁrst declension of his power so much betrayed by his own servants that there were very few who remained faithful to him yet that treachery proceeded not always from any treasonable purpose to him any harm but from particular and personal animosities against other men and afterward the terror all men were under of the parliament and the guilt they were conscious of themselves made them watch all opportunities to make themselves gracious to those who could them good and so they became spies upon their master and from one piece of knavery were hardened and conﬁrmed to undertake another till at

wisdom from him that by it he might be ordered and with it might order all things under his hand unto god glory i spoke much to him of truth and great deal of discourse i had with him about religion wherein he carried himself very moderately but he said we quarreled with the priests whom he called ministers i told him i did not quarrel with them they quarreled with and my friends but said i if we own the prophets christ and the apostles we can not hold up such teachers prophets and shepherds the prophets christ and the apostles declared against but we must declare against them by the same

hire and were covetous and greedy like the dumb dogs that could never have enough and that they who have the same spirit that christ and the prophets and the apostles had could not but declare against all such now they did then i spoke he several times said it was very good and it was truth i told him that all christendom so called had the scriptures but they wanted the power and spirit that those had who gave forth the scriptures and that was the reason they were not in fellowship with the son nor with the father nor with the scriptures nor one with another many more words i had with him but people coming in i drew little back i was turning he catched by the hand and with tears in his eyes said come again to my house if thou and i were but an hour of day together we should be nearer one to the other adding that he wished more ill than he did to his own soul i told him if he did he wronged his own soul and admonished him to harken to god voice that he might stand in his counsel and obey it and if he did so that would keep him from hardness of heart but if he did not hear god voice his heart would be hardened he said it was true then i went out and when captain drury came out

and entering into the country of beulah whose air was very sweet and pleasant the way lying directly through it they solaced them there the season yea here they heard continually the singing of birds and saw every day the ﬂowers appear in the earth and heard the voice of the turtle in the land in this country the sun shineth night and day wherefore it was beyond the valley of the shadow of death and also out of the reach of giant despair neither could they from this place so much see doubting castle here they were within sight of the city they were going to also here met them some of the inhabitants thereof in this land the shining ones commonly walked because it was upon the borders of heaven in this land also the contract between the bride and bridegroom was renewed yea here the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so did their god rejoice over them here they had want of corn and wine in this place they met abundance of what they had sought in all their pilgrimage here they heard voices from out of the city loud voices saying say ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him here all the inhabitants of the country called them the holy people the redeemed of the lord sought out etc now they walked in this land they had more rejoicing than in parts more remote from the kingdom to which they were bound and drawing nearer to the city yet they had more perfect view thereof it was built of pearls and precious stones also the streets 165 166 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https were paved with gold so that by reason of the natural glory of the city and the reﬂection of the sunbeams upon it christian with desire fell sick hopeful also had ﬁt or two of the same disease wherefore here they lay by it while crying out because of their pangs if you see my beloved tell him that i am sick of love but being little strengthened and better able to bear their sickness they walke d on their way and came yet nearer and nearer where were orchards vineyards and gardens and their gates opened into the highway now they came up to these places behold the gardener stood in the way to whom the pilgrims said whose goodly vineyards and gardens are these he answered they are the king and are planted here his own delight and also the solace of pilgrims so the gardener had them into the vineyards and bid them refresh themselves with dainties he also shewed them there the king walks and arbors where he delighted to be and here they tarried and slept now i beheld in my dream that they talked more in their sleep at this time than ever they did in all their journey and being in muse thereabout the gardener said even to wherefore musest thou at the matter it is the nature of the fruit of the grapes of these vineyards to go down so sweetly to cause the lips of them that are asleep to speak so i saw that when they awoke they addrest themselves to go up to the city but i said the reﬂection of the sun upon the the city was pure so extremely glorious that they could not yet with open face behold it but through an instrument made that purpose so i saw that they went on there met them two men in raiment that shone like gold also their faces shone the light these men asked the pilgrims whence they came and they told them they also asked them where they had lodged what difﬁculties and dangers what comforts and pleasures they had met with in their way and they told them then said the men that met them you have but two difﬁculties more to meet with and then you are in the city christian and his companion then asked the men to go along with them so they told them that they would but said they you must obtain it by your own faith so i saw in my dream that they went on together till they came in sight of the gate then i saw in my dream that christian was in muse while to whom also hopeful added these words be of good cheer jesus christ maketh thee whole and with that christian brake out with loud i see him again and he tells when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overﬂow thee then they both took courage and the enemy was after that still stone until they were gone over christian therefore presently found ground to stand upon and so it followed that the rest of the river was but shallow but thus they got over now upon the bank of the river on the other side they saw the two shining men again who there waited them wherefore being come out of the river they saluted them saying we are ministering spirits sent to minister to those that shall be heirs of salvation thus they went along toward the gate now you must note that the city stood upon mighty hill but the pilgrims went up that hill with ease because they had these two men to lead them up by the arms they had likewise left their mortal garments behind them in the river tho they went in with them they came out without them they therefore went up here with much agility and speed tho the foundation upon which the city was framed was higher than the clouds ii the dea th of valiant and of ast 98 167

can get it my marks and scars i carry with to be witness that i have fought his battles who now will be my rewarder when the day that he must go hence was come many accompanied him to the river into which he went he said death where is thy sting and he went down deeper he said grave where is thy victory so he passed over and all the trumpets sounded him on the other side then there came forth summons mr this mr was he that the rest of the pilgrims found upon his knees in the inchanted ground the post brought it him open in his hands the contents whereof were that he must prepare change of life his master was not willing that he should be so far from him any longer at this mr was put into muse nay said the messenger you need not doubt of the truth of my message here is token of the

yet since the time i knew you you have been proﬁtable to when i came from home i left behind wife and ﬁve small children let entreat you at your return i know that you will go and return to your

they may prevail when mr had thus set things in order and the time being come him to haste him away he also went down to the river now there was great calm at that time in the river wherefore mr when

methinks i stand easy my foot is ﬁxt upon that upon which the feet of the priests that bare the ark of the covenant stood while israel went over this jordan the waters indeed are to the palate bitter

days are ended i am going now to see that head that was crowned with thorns and that face that was spit upon i have formerly lived by hear and faith but now i go where i shall live by sight and shall be with him in whose company i delight myself i have loved to hear my lord spoken of and wherever i have seen the print of his shoe in the earth there i have coveted to set my foot too his name has been to yea sweeter than all perfumes his voice to has been most sweet and his countenance i have more desired than they that have most desired the light of the sun his word i did use to gather my food and antidotes against my faintings he has held and i have kept from mine iniquities yea my steps hath he strengthened in his way now while he was thus in discourse his coun tenance changed his

went up and followed one another in at the beautiful gate of the city iii ancient vanity fair 99 then i saw in my dream that when they were got out of the wilderness they presently saw town before them and the name of that town is vanity and at the town there is fair kept called vanity fair it is kept all the year long it beareth the name of vanity fair because the town where is kept is lighter than vanity and also because all that is there sold or that cometh thither is vanity is the saying of the wise all that cometh is vanity this fair is new erected business but thing of ancient standing i will shew you the original of it almost ﬁve thousand years agone there were pilgrims walking to the celestia l city these two honest persons are and beelzebub apollyon and legion with their companions perceiving by the path that the pilgrims made that their way to the city lay through this town of vanity they contrived here to set up fair fair wherein should be sold of all sorts of vanity and that it should last all the year long therefore at this fair are all such merchandise sold houses lands trades places honors preferments titles countries kingdoms lusts pleasures and delights of all sorts whores bawds wives husbands children masters servants lives blood bodies souls silver gold pearls precious stones and what not now i said the way to the celestial city lies just through this town where this lusty fair is kept and he that will go to the city and yet not go through this town must needs go out of the world the prince of princes himself when here went through this town to his own country and that upon too yea and i think it was beelzebub the chief lord of this fair that invited him to buy of his vanities yea would have made him lord of the fair would he but have done him reverence he went through the town yea because he was such person of honor beelzebub had him from street to street and shewed him all the kingdoms of the world in little time that he might if possible allure that blessed one to cheapen and buy some of his vanities but he had mind to the merchandise and therefore left the town without laying out so much one farthing upon these vanities this fair therefore is an ancient thing of long standing and very great fair the pilgrims being patient and not rendering railing railing but contrarywise blessing and giving good words bad and kindness injuries done some men in the fair that were more observing and less prejudiced than the rest began to check and blame the baser sort their continual abuses done by them to the men they therefore in angry manner let ﬂy at them again counting them bad the men in the cage and telling them that they seemed confederates and should be made partakers of their misfortunes the other replied that ought they could see the men were quiet and sober and intended nobody any harm and that there were many that traded in their fair that were more worthy to be put into the cage yea and pillory too than were the men that they had abused thus after divers words had passed on both sides the men behaving themselves all the while very wisely and soberly before them they fell to some blows among themselves and did harm one to another then were these two poor men 173 174 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https before their examiners again and there charged being guilty of the late hubbub that had been in the fair so they beat them pitifully and hanged irons upon them and led them in chaines up and down the fair an example and terror to others lest any should further speak in their behalf or join themselves unto them but christian and faithful behaved themselves yet more wisely and received the ignominy and shame that was cast upon them with so much meekness and patience that it won to their side tho but few in comparison of the rest several of the men in the fair this put the other party yet into greater rage insomuch that they concluded the death of these two men wherefore they threat ened that the cage nor irons should serve their turn but that they should die the abuse they had done and deluding the men of the fair behold vanity fair the pilgrims there are chained and stoned beside even so it was our lord past here and on mount calvary died then were they remanded to the cage again until further order should be taken with them so they put them in and made their feet fast in the stocks here also they called again to mind what they had heard from their faithf ul friend evangelist and were the more conﬁrmed in their way and sufferings by what he told them would happen to them they also now comforted each other that whose lot it was to suffer even he should have the best therefore each man secretly wished that he might have that preferment but committing themselves to the allwise dispose of him that ruleth all things with much content they abode in the condition in which they were until they should be otherwise disposed of then convenient time being appointed they brought them forth to their tryal in order to their condemnation when the time was come they were brought before their enemies and arraigned the judge name was lord their indictment was one and the same in substance tho somewhat varying in form the contents whereof was this that they were enemies to and disturbers of their trade that they had made commotions and divisions in the town and had won party to their own most danger ous opinions in contempt of the law of their prince now faithful play the man speak thy god fear not the wickeds malice nor their rod speak boldly man the truth is on thy side die it and to life in triumph ride then faithful began to answer that he had only set himself against that which had set itself against him that is higher than the highest and said he disturbance i make none being myself man of peace the party that were won to us were won by beholding our truth and innocence and they are only turned from the worse to the better and to the king you talk of since he is beelzebub the enemy of our lord i defy him and all his angels then proclamation was made that they that had aught to say their lord the king against the prisoner at the bar should forthwith appear and give in their evidence so there came in three witnesses to wit envy superstition and pickthank they were then asked if they knew the prisoner at the bar and what they had to say their lord the king against him then stood forth envy and said to this effect my lord i have known this man long time and will attest upon my oath before this honorable bench that he judge hold give him life oath so they sware him 175 176 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the

nor custom but doth all that he can to possess all men with certain of his disloyal notions which he in the general calls principles of faith and holiness and in particular i heard him once myself afﬁrm that christianity and the customs of our town of vanity were diametrically opposite and could not be reconciled by which saying my lord he doth at once not only condemn all our laudable doings but us in the doing of them judge then did the judge say to him hast thou any more to say envy my lord i could say much more only i would not be tedious to the court yet if need be when the other gentlemen have given in their evidence rather than anything shall be wanting that will despatch him i will enlar ge my testimony against him so he was bid stand by then they called superstition and bid him look upon the prisoner they also asked what he could say their lord the king against him then they sware him so he began super my lord i have great acquaintance with this man nor i desire to have further knowledge of him however this i know that he is very pestilent fellow from some discourse that the other day i had with him in this town then talking with him i heard him say that our religion was naught and such by which man could by means please god which sayings of his my lord your lordship very well knows what necessarily thence will follow to wit that we still worship in vain are yet in our sins and ﬁnally shall be damned and this is that which i have to say then was pickthank sworn and bid say what he knew in behalf of their lord the king against the prisoner at the bar pick my lord and you gentlemen all this fellow i have known of long time and have heard him speak things that ought not to be spoke he hath railed on our noble prince beelzebub and hath spoken contemptibly of his honorable friends whose names are the lord old man the lord carnal delight the lord luxurious the lord desir of vain glory my old lord lechery sir having greedy with all the rest of our nobility and he hath said moreover that if all men were of his mind if possible there is not one of these noblemen should have any longer being in this town besides he hath not been afraid to rail on you my lord who are now appointed to be his judge calling you an ungodly villain with many other suchlike vilifying terms with which he hath bespattered most of the gentry of our town when this pickthank had told his tale the judge directed his speech to the prisoner at the bar saying thou runagate heretick and traitor hast thou heard what these honest gentlemen have witnessed against thee faith may i speak few words in my own defense judge sirrah sirrah thou deservest to live longer but to be slain immediately upon the place yet that all men may see our gentleness towards thee let us see what thou hast to say faith i say then in answer to what mr envy hath spoken i never said ought but this that what rule or laws or custom or people were ﬂat against the word of god are diametrically opposite to christianity if i have said amiss in this convince of my error and i am ready here before you to make my recantation to the second to wit mr superstition and his charge against i said only this that in the worship of god there is requir ed divine faith but there can be divine faith without divine revelation of the will of god therefore whatever is thrust into the worship of god that is not agreeable to divine revelation can not be done but by an human faith which faith will not pr oﬁt to eternal life 177 178 179 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the

him fletcher and jonson never equalled them to him in their esteem and in the last king court when ben reputation was at highest sir john suckling and with him the greater part of the courtiers set our shakespeare far above him beaumont and fletcher of whom i am next to speak had with the advantage of shakespeare wit which was their precedent great natural gifts improved by study beaumont especially being so accurate judge of plays that ben jonson while he lived submitted all his writings to his censure and is thought used his judgment in correcting if not contriving all his plots what value he had him appears by the verses he writ to him and therefore i need speak farther of it the ﬁrst play that brought fletcher and him in esteem was their philaster before that they had written two or three very unsuccessfully the like is reported of ben jonson before he writ every man in his humor their plots were generally more regular than shakespeare especia lly those which were made before beaumont death and they understood and imitated the conversation of gentlemen much better whose wild debaucheries and quickness of wit in repartees poet before them could paint they have done

generally with all men humors shakespeare language is likewise little obsolete and ben jonson wit comes short of theirs jonson to whose character i am now arrived if we look upon him while he was his last plays were but his think him the most learned and judicious writer which any theater ever had he was most severe judge of himself well others one can not say he wanted wit but rather that he was frugal of it in his works you ﬁnd little to retrench or alter wit and language and humor also in some measure we had before him but something of art was wanting to the drama till he came he managed his strength to more advantage than any who preceded him you seldom ﬁnd him making love in any of his scenes or endeavoring to move the passions his genius was too sullen and saturnine to it gracefully especially when he knew he came after those who had performed both to such height humor was his proper sphere and in that he delighted most to represent mecha nic people he was deeply conversa nt in the ancients both greek and latin and he borrowed boldly from them there is scarce poet or historian among the roman authors of those times whom he has not translated in sejanus and catiline but he has done his robberies so openly that one may see he fears not to be taxed by any law he invades authors like monarch and what would be theft in other poets is only victory in him with the spoils of these writers he so represents old rome to us in its rites ceremonies and customs that if one of their poets had written either of his tragedies we had seen less of it than in him 182 183 184 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https there was any fault in his language was that he weaved it too closely and laboriously in his comedies especially perhaps too he did little too much romanize our tongue leaving the words which he translated almost much latin he found them wherein tho he learnedly followed their language he did not enough comply with the idiom of ours if i would compare him with shakespeare i must acknowledge him the more correct poet but shakespeare the greater wit shakespeare was the homer or father of our dramatic poets jonson was the virgil the pattern of elaborate writing i admire him but i love shakespeare to conclude of him he has given us the most correct plays so in the precepts which he has

over which i have mentioned before and is gone with them back while we were at the excise ofﬁce talking with ball it was computed that the parliament had given the king this war only besides all

lifetime charles ii 105 thus lived and died king charles ii he was the greatest instance in history of the various revolutions of which any one man seemed capable he was bred up the ﬁrst twelve years of his life with the splendo r that became the heir of so great crown after that he passed through eighteen years of great inequalities unhappy in the war in the loss of his father and of the crown of england scotland did not only receive him tho upon terms hard of digestion but made an attempt upon england him tho feeble one he lost the battle of worcester with too much indifference and then he shewed more care of his person than became one who had so much at stake he wandered about england ten weeks after that hiding from place to place but under all the apprehensions he had then upon him he shewed temper so careless and so much turned to levity that he was then diverting himself with little household sports in unconcerned manner if he had made loss and had been in danger at all he got at last out of england but he had been obliged to so many who had been faithful to him and careful of him that he seemed afterwards to resolve to make an equal return to them all and ﬁnding it not easy to reward them all they deserved he forgot them all alike most princes seem to have this pretty deep in them and to think that they ought not to remember past services but that their acceptance of them is full reward he of all in our age exerted this piece of prerogative in the amplest manner he never seemed to charge his memory or to trouble his thoughts with the sense of any of the services that had been done him while he was abroad at paris cologne or brussels he never seemed to lay anything to heart he pursued all his diversions and irregular pleasures in free career and seemed to be serene under the loss of crown the greatest philosopher could have been nor did he willingly hearken to any of those projects with which he often complained that his chancellor persecuted

expense and it was often said that if cromwell would have compounded the matter and have given him good round pension that he might have been induced to resign his title to him during his exile he delivered himself so entirely to his pleasures that he became incapable of application he spent little of his time in reading or study and yet less in thinking and in the state his affairs were then in he accustomed himself to say to every person and upon all occasions that which he thought would please most so that words or promises went very easily from him and he had so ill an opinion of mankind that he thought the great art of living and governing was to manage all things and all persons with depth of craft and dissimulation and in that few men in the world could put on the appearances of sincerity better than he could under which so much artiﬁce was usually hid that in conclusion he could deceive none all were become mistrustful of him he had great vices but scarce any virtues to correct them he had in him some vices that were less hurtful which corrected his more hurtful ones he was during the active part of life given up to sloth and lewdness to such degree that he hated business and could not bear the engaging in anything that gave him much trouble or put him under any constraint and tho he desired to become absolute and to overturn both our religion and our laws yet he would neither run the risk nor give himself the trouble which so great design required he had an appearance of gentleness in his outward deportment but he seemed to have bowels nor tenderness in his nature and in the end of his life he became cruel he was apt to forgive all crimes even blood itself yet he never forgave anything that was done against himself after his ﬁrst and general act of indemnity which was to be reckoned done rather upon maxims of state than inclinations of mercy he delivered himself up to most enormous course of vice without any sort of restraint even from the consideration of the nearest relations the most studied extravaga nces that way seemed to the very last to be much delighted in and pursued by him he had the art of making all people grow fond of him at ﬁrst by softness in his whol way of conversation he was certainly the man of the age but when it appe ared how little could be built on his promise they were cured of the fondness that he was apt to raise in them when he saw young men of quality who had something more than ordinary in them he drew them about him and set himself to corrupt them both in religion and morality in which he proved so unhappily successful that he left england much changed at his death from what he had found it at his restoration he loved to talk over all the stories of his life to every new man that came about him his stay in scotland and the share he had in the war of paris in carrying messages from one side to the other were his common topics he went over these in very graceful manner but so often and so copiously that all those who had been long accustomed to them grew weary of them and when he entered on those stories they usually withdrew so that he often began them in full audience and before he had done there were not abov four or ﬁve persons left about him which drew severe jest from wilmot earl of rochester 106 he said he wondered to see man have so good memory to repeat the same story without losing the least circumstance and yet not remember that he had told it to the same persons the very day before this made him fond of strangers they harkened to all his stories and went away in rapture at such an uncommon condescension of king his person and temper his vices well his fortunes resemble the character that we have given us of tiberius so much that it were easy to draw the parallel between them tiberius banishment and his coming afterward to reign makes the comparison in that respect come pretty near his hating of business and his love of pleasures his raising of favorites and trusting them entirely and his pulling them down and hating them excessively his art of covering deep designs particularly of revenge with an appearance of softness brings them so near likeness that i did not wonder much to observe the resemblance of their faces and persons at rome i saw one of the last statues made tiberius after he had lost his teeth but bating the alteration

best thought it was because he had lost him by whom only he could have balanced the surviving brother whom he hated and yet embroiled all his af fairs to preserve the succession to him part of his character looked wickeder well meaner than that he all the while that he was professing to be of the church of england expressing both zeal and affection to it was yet secretly reconciled to the church of rome thus mocking god and deceiving the world with so gross prevarication and his not having the honesty or courage to own it at the last his not shewing any sign of the least remorse his

itself went back and left upon the land almost dry but half dead with the water i took in i had so much presence of mind well breath left that seeing myself nearer the mainland than i expected i got upon my feet and ende avored to make on toward the land i could before another wave should return and take up 200 105 106 201 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https but i soon found it was impossibl to avoid it i saw the sea coming after high great hill and furious an enemy which i had means or strength to contend with my business was to hold my breath and raise myself upon the water if i could and so by swimming to preserve my breathing and pilot myself toward the shore if possible my greatest concern now being that the wave it would carry great way toward the shore when it came on might not carry back again with it when it gave back toward the sea the wave that came upon again buried at once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body and i could feel myself carried with mighty force and swiftness toward the shore very great way but i held my breath and assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might i was ready to burst with holding my breath when i felt myself rising up so to my immediate relief i found my head and hands shoot out above the surface of the water and tho it was not two seconds of time that i could keep myself so yet it relieved greatly gave breath and new courage i was covered again with water good while but not so long but i held it out and ﬁnding the water had spent itself and began to return i struck forward against the return of the waves and felt ground again with my feet i stood still few moments to recover breath and till the water went from and then took to my heels and ran with what strength i had farther toward the shore but neither would this deliver from the fury of the sea which came pouring in after again and twice more i was lifted up by the waves and carried forward before the shore being very ﬂat the last time of these two had been fatal to the sea having hurried along before landed or rather dashed against piece of rock and that with such force that it left senseless and indeed helpless to my own deliverance the blow taking my side and breast beat the breath it were quite out of my body and had it returned again immediately i must have been strangled in the water but i recovered little before the return of the waves and seeing i should again be covered with the water i resolved to hold fast by piece of the rock and so to hold my breath if possib le till the wave went back now the waves were not so high the ﬁrst being nearer land i held my hold till the wave abated and then fetched another run which brought so near the shore that the next wave tho it went over yet did not so swallow up to carry away and the next run i took i got to the mainland where to my great comfort i clambered up the cliffs of the shore and sat down upon the grass free from danger and quite out of the reach of the water i was now landed and safe on shore and began to look up and thank god that my life was saved in case wherein there were some minutes before scarce any room to hope i believe it is impossible to express to the life what the ecstasies and transports of the soul are when it is so saved i may say out of the grave and i did not wonder now at the custom that when malefactor who has the halter about his neck is tied up and just going to be turned off and has reprieve brought to say i not wonder that they bring surgeon with it to let him blood that very moment they tell him of it that the surprize may not drive the animal spirits from the heart and overwhelm him sudden joys like griefs confound at ﬁrst i walked about the shore lifting up my hands and my whole being i may say wrapt up in the contemplation of my deliverance making thousand gestures and motions which i can not describe reﬂecting upon my comrades that were drowned and that there should not be one soul saved but myself them i never saw them afterward or any sign of them except three of the hats one cap and two shoes that were not fellows ii 202 203 204

musing had it were resolved them all into nothing want of an occasion to put them in execution i was surprized one morning early by seeing less than ﬁve canoes all on shore together on my side the island and the people who belonged to them all landed and out of my sight the number of them broke all my measures seeing so many and knowing that they always came four or six or sometimes more in boat i could not tell what to think of it or how to take my measures to attack twenty or thirty men so lay still in my castle perplexed and discomforted however i put myself into all the same postures an attack that i had form erly provided and was just ready action if anything had presented having waited good while listening to hear if they made any noise at length being very impatient i set my guns at the foot of my ladder and clambered up to the top of the hill by my two stages usual standing so however that my head did not appear above the hill so that they could not perceive by any means here i observed by the help of my perspective glass that they were less than thirty in number that they had ﬁre kindled and that they had meat drest how they had cooked it i knew not or what it was but they were all dancing in i know not how many barbarous gestures and ﬁgures their own way round the ﬁre while i was thus looking on them i perceived by my perspective two miserable wretches dragged from the boats where it seems they were laid by and were now brought out the slaughter i perceived one of them immediately fall being knocked down i suppose with club or wooden sword that was their way and two or three others were at work immediately cutting him open their cookery while the other victim was left standing by himself till they should be ready him in that very moment this poor wretch seeing himself little at liberty and unbound nature inspired him with hopes of life and he started away from them and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands directly toward i mean toward that part of the coast where my habitation was i was dreadfully frightened that i must acknowledge when i perceived him run my way and especially when i thought i saw him pursued by the whole body and now i expected that part of my dream was coming to pass and that he would certainly take shelter in my grove but i could not depend by any means upon my dream that the other savages would not pursue him thither and ﬁnd him there however i kept my station and my spirits began to recover when i found that there was not above three men that followed him and still more was encouraged when i found that he outstript them exceedingly in running and gained ground on them so that if he could but hold it half an hour i saw easily he would fairly get away from them all there was between them and my castle the creek which i mentioned often in the ﬁrst part of my story where i landed my cargoes out of the ship and this i saw plainly he must necessarily swim over or the poor wretch would be taken there but when the savage escaping came thither he made nothing of it tho the tide was then up but plunging in swam through in about thirty strokes or thereabouts landed and ran with exceeding strength and swiftness when the three persons came to the creek i found that two of them could swim but the third could not and that standing on the other side he looked at the others but went farther and soon after went softly back again which it happened was very well him in the end i observed that the two who swam were yet more than twice long swimming over the creek than the fellow was that ﬂed from them it came very warmly upon my thoughts and indeed irresistibly that now was the time to get servant and perhaps companion or assistant and that i was plainly called by providence to save this poor creature life i immediately ran down the ladder with all possible expedition fetched my two guns they were both at the foot of the ladder i observed before and getting up again with the same haste to the top of the hill i crost toward the sea and having very short cut and all down hill clap myself in the way between the pursuers and the pursued hallooing aloud to him that ﬂed who looking back was at ﬁrst perhaps much frightened at at them but i beckoned with my hand to him to come back and in the mean time i slowly advanced toward the 205 206 207 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https that followed then rushing at once upon the foremost i knocked him down with the stock of my piece i was loath to ﬁre because i would not have the rest hear tho at that distance it would not have been easily heard and being out of sight of the smoke too they would not have known what to make of it having knoc ked this fellow down the other who pursued him stopt if he had been frightened and i advanced toward him but i came nearer i perceived presently he had bow and arrow and was ﬁtting it to shoot at so i was then obliged to shoot at him ﬁrst which i did and killed him at the ﬁrst shot the poor savage who ﬂed but had stopt tho he saw both his enemies fallen and killed he thought yet was so frightened with the ﬁre and noise of my piece that he stood stock still and neither came forward nor went backward tho he seemed rather inclined still to ﬂy than to come on i hallooed again to him and made signs to come forward which he easily understood and came little way then stopt again and then little farther and stopt again and i could then perceive that he stood trembling if he had been taken prisoner and had just been to be killed his two enemies were i beckoned to him again to come to and gave him all the signs of encouragement that i could think of and he came nearer and nearer kneeling down every ten or twelve steps in token of acknowledgment saving his life i smiled at him and looked pleasantly and beckoned to him to come still nearer at length he came close to and then he kneeled down again kissed the ground and laid his head upon the ground and taking by the foot set my foot upon his head this it seems was in token of swearing to be my slave forever i took him up and made much of him and encouraged him all i could but there was more work to yet i perceived the savage whom i had knocked down was not killed but stunned with the blow and began to come to himself so i pointed to him and showed him the savage that he was not dead upon this he spoke some words to and tho i could not understand them yet i thought they were pleasant to hear they were the ﬁrst sound of man voice that i had heard my own excepted above years but there was time such reﬂections now the savage who was knocked down recovered himself so far to sit up upon the ground and i perceived that my savage began to be afraid but when i saw that i presented my other piece at the man if i would shoot him upon this my savage so i call him now made motion to to lend him my sword which hung naked in belt by my side which i did he sooner had it but he runs to his enemy and at one blow cut off his head cleverly executioner in germany could have done it sooner or better which i thought very strange one who i had reason to believe never saw sword in his life before except their own wooden swords however it seems learned afterwards they make their wooden swords so sharp so heavy and the wood is so hard that they will even cut off heads with them ay and arms and that at one blow too when he had done this he comes laughing to in sign of triumph and brought the sword again and with abundance of gestures which i did not understand laid it down with the head of the savage that he had killed just before but that which astonished him most was to know how i killed the other indian so far off so pointing to him he made signs to to let him go to him and i bade him go well i could when he came to him he stood like one amazed looking at him turning him ﬁrst on one side then on the other looked at the wound the bullet had made which it seems was just in his breast where it had made hole and great quantity of blood had followed but he had bled inwardly he was quite dead upon this he made signs to that he should bury them with sand that they might not be seen by the rest if they followed and so i made signs to him again to so he fell to work and in an instant he had scraped hole in the sand with his hands big enough to bury the ﬁrst in and then dragged him into it and covered him and did so by the other also i believe he had buried them both in quarter of an hour then calling him away i carried him not to my castle but quite away to my cave on the farther part of the island so i did not let my dream come to pass in that part that he came into my grove shelter here i gave him bread and bunch of raisins to eat and draft of water which i found he was indeed in great distress from his running and having refreshed him i made signs him to go and lie down to sleep showing him place where i had laid 208 209 210 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https rice straw and blanket upon it which i used to sleep upon myself

little before the ﬁre the old women and the phlegmatic hypochondriac part of the other sex whom i could almost call the old women too remarked especially afterward tho not till both those judgments were over that those two comets passed directly over the city and that so very near the houses that it was plain they imported something peculiar to the city alone that the comet before the pestilence was of faint dull languid color and its motion very heavy solemn and slow but that the comet before the ﬁre was bright and sparkling or others said ﬂaming and its motion swift and furious and that accordingly one foretold heavy judgment slow but severe terrible and frightful was the plague but the other foretold stroke sudden swift and ﬁery was the conﬂagration nay so particular some people were that they looked upon that comet preceding the ﬁre they fancied that they not only saw it pass swiftly and ﬁercely and could perceive the motion with their eye but they even heard it it made rushing mighty noise ﬁerce and terrible tho at distance and but just perceivable the shutting up of houses was at ﬁrst counted very cruel and unchristian method and the poor people so conﬁned made bitter lamentations complaints of the severity of it were also daily brought to my lord mayor of houses causelessly and some maliciously shut up i can not say but upon inquiry many that complained so loudly were found in condition to be continued and others again inspection being made upon the sick person and the sickness not appearing infectious or if uncertain yet on his being content to be carried to the was released i went along houndsditch one morning about eight there was great noise it is true indeed that there was not much crowd because the people were not free to gather together or to stay together when they were there nor did i stay long there but the outcry was loud enough to prompt my curiosity and i called to one who looked out of window and asked what was the matter watchman it seems had been employed to keep his post at the door of house which was infected or said to be infected and was shut up he had been there all night two nights together he told his story and the day watchman had been there one day and was now come to relieve him all this while noise had been heard in the house light had been seen they called nothing sent him on errands which used to be the chief business of the watchman neither had they given him any disturbance he said from monday afternoon when he heard great crying and screaming in the house which he supposed was occasioned by some of the family dying just at that time it seems the night before the it was called had been stopt there and had been brought down to the door dead and the buriers or bearers they were called put her into the cart wrapt only in green rug and carried her away the watchman had knocked at the door it seems when he heard that noise and crying above and nobody answered great while but at last one looked out and said with an angry quick tone and yet kind of crying voice or voice of one that was crying what d want that you make such knocking he answered i am the watchman how you what is the matter the person answered what is that to you stop the cart this it seems was about one soon after the fellow said he stopt the 211 212 213 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https and then knocked again but nobody answered he continued knocking and the bellman called out several times bring out your dead but nobody answere d till the man that drove the cart being called to other houses would stay longer and drove away the watchman knew not what to make of all this so he let them alone till the morning man or day watchman they called him came to relieve him giving him an account of the particulars they knocked at the door great while but nobody answered and they observed that the window or casement at which the person looked out who had answered before continued open being up two pair of stairs upon this the two men to satisfy their curiosity got long ladder and one of them went up to the window and looked into the room where he saw woman lying dead upon the ﬂoor in dismal manner having clothes on but her shift but tho he called aloud and putting in his long staff knocked hard on the ﬂoor yet nobody stirred or answered neither could he hear any noise in the house he came down upon this and acquainted his fellow who went up also and ﬁnding it just so they resolved to acquaint either the lord mayor or some other magistrate of it but did not offer to go in at the window the magistrate it seems upon the information of the two men ordered the house to be broken open constable and other persons being appointed to be present that nothing might be plundered and accordingly it was so done when nobody was found in the house but that young woman who having been infected and past recovery the rest had left her to die by herself and every one gone having found some way to delude the watchman and to get open the door or get out at some back door or over the tops of the houses so that he knew nothing of it and to those cries and shrieks which he heard it was supposed they were the passionate cries of the family at this bitter parting which to be sure it was to them all this being the sister to the mistress of the family the man of the house his wife several children and servants being all gone and ﬂed whether sick or sound that i could never learn nor indeed did i make much inquiry after it this deaths in about month was prodigious number of itself but if i should add the reasons which i have to believe that this account was deﬁcient and how deﬁcient it was you would with make scruple to believe that there died above week all those weeks and proport ion several weeks both before and after the confusion among the people especially within the city at that time was inexpressible the terror was so great at last that the courage of the people appointed to carry away the dead began to fail them nay several of them died altho they had the distemper before and were recovered and some of them had dropt down when they had been carrying the bodies even at the pitside and just ready to throw them in and this confusion was greater in the city because they had ﬂattered themselves with hopes of escaping and thought the bitterness of death was past one cart they told us going up to shoreditch was forsaken by the drivers or being left to one man to drive he died in the street and the horses going on overthrew the cart and left the bodies some thrown here some there is dismal manner another cart was it seems found in the great pit in finsbury fields the driver being dead or having been gone and abandoned it and the horses running too near it the cart fell in and drew the horses in also it was suggested that the driver was thrown in with it and that the cart fell upon him by reason his whip was seen to be in the pit among the bodies but that i suppose could not be certain footnotes from the life and surprizing adventures of robinson crusoe from the life and surprizing

bigness of die but some larger than others they were all linked together by slender wires these bits of wood were covered on every square with paper pasted on them and on these papers were written all the words of their language in their several moods tenses and declensions but without any order the professor then desired to observe he was going to set his engine at work the pupils at his command took each of them hold of an iron handle whereof there were forty ﬁxt round the edges of the frame and giving them sudden turn the whole disposition of the words was entirely changed he then commanded of the lads to read the several lines softly they appeared upon the frame and where they found three or four words together that might make part of sentence they dictated to the four remaining boys who were scribes this work was repeated three or four times and at every turn the engine was so contrived that the words shifted into new places the square bits of wood moved upside down six hours day the young students were employed in this labor and the professor shewed several volumes in large folio already collected of broken sentences which he intended to piece together and out of those rich materials give the world complete body of all arts and sciences we next went to the school of languages where three professors sat in consulta tion upon improving that of their own country the ﬁrst project was to shorten discourse by cutting polysyllables into one and leaving out verbs and participles because in reality all things imaginable are but nouns the other was scheme entirely abolishing all words whatsoever and this was urged great advantage in point of health well brevity it is plain that every word we speak is in some degree diminution of our lungs by corrosion and consequently contributes to the shortening of our lives an expedient was therefore offered that since words are only names things it would be more convenient all men to carry about them such things were necessary to express the particular business they are to discourse on and this invention would certainly have taken place to the great ease well health of the subject if the women in conjunction with the vulgar and illiterate had not threatened to raise rebellion unless they might be allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues after the manner of their forefathers such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are the common people another great advantage proposed by this invention was that it would serve universal language to be understood in all civilized nations whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind or nearly resembling so that their uses might easily be comprehended and thus ambassadors would be qualiﬁed to treat with foreign princes or ministers of state to whose

over his ditches and at last forced to alight in the dirt when my horse having slipt his bridle ran away and took us up more than an hour to recover him again it is evident that none of the absurdities i met with in this visit proceeded from an ill intention but from wrong judgment of complaisance and misapplication in the rules of it iii the art of lying in politics 112 i am prevailed on through the importunity of friends to interrupt the scheme i had begun in my last paper by an essay upon the art of political lying we are told the devil is the father of lies and was liar from the beginning so that beyond contradiction the invention is old and which is more his ﬁrst essay of it was purely political employed in undermining the authority of his prince and seducing third part of the subjects from their obedience which he was driven down from heaven where milton expresses it he had been viceroy of great western province and forced to exercise his talent in inferior regions among other fallen spirits poor or deluded men whom he still daily tempts to his own sin and will ever so till he be chained in the bottomless pit but altho the devil be the father of lies he seems like other great inventors to have lost much of his reputation by the continual improvements that have been made upon him who ﬁrst reduced lying into an art and adapted it to politics is not so clear from history altho i have made some diligent inquiries i shall therefore consider it only according to the modern system it has been cultivated these twenty years past in the southern part of our own island the poets tell us that after the giants were overthrown by the gods the earth in revenge produced her last offspring which was fame and the fable is thus interpreted that when tumults and seditions are quieted rumors and false reports are plentifully sprea d through nation so that by this account lying is the last relief of routed rebellious party in state but here the moderns have made great additions applying this art to the gaining of power and preserving it well revenging themselves after they have lost it the same instruments are made use of by animals to feed themselves when they are hungry and to bite those that tread upon them but the same genealogy can not always be admitted political lying i shall therefore desire to reﬁne upon it by adding some circumstances of its birth and parents political lie is sometimes born out of discard ed statesman head and thence delivered to be 224 225 226 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii

when i am in serious humor i very often walk by myself in westminster abbey where the gloominess of the place and the use to which it is applied with the solemn ity of the building and the condition of the people who lie in it are apt to ﬁll the mind with kind of melancholy or rather thoughtfulness that is not disagreeable i yesterday passed 110 111 112 113 114 236 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https afternoon in the churchyard the cloisters and the church amusing mysel f with the tombstones and inscriptions that i met with in those several regions of the dead most of them recorded nothing else of the buried person but that he was born upon one day and died upon another the whole history of his life being comprehended in those two circumstances that are common to all mankind i could not but look upon these registers of existence whether of brass or marble kind of satire upon the departed persons who had left other memorial of them but that they were born and that they died they put one in mind of several persons mentioned in the battles of heroic poems who have sounding names given them other reason but that they may be killed and are celebrated nothing but being knocked on the head glaucumque medontaque thersilochumque the life of these men is ﬁnely described in holy writ by the path of an arrow which is immediately closed up and lost upon my going into the church i entertained myself with the digging of grave and saw in every shovelful of it that was thrown up the fragment of bone or skull intermixt with kind of fresh moldering earth that some time or other had place in the composition of human body upon this i began to consider with myself what innumerable multitudes of people lay confused together under the pavement of that ancient cathedral how men and women friends and enemies priests and soldiers monks and prebendaries were crumbled amongst one another and blended together in the same common mass how beauty strength and youth with old age weakness and deformity lay undistinguished in the same promiscuous heap of matter and having thus surveyed this great magazine of mortality it were in the lump i ex amined it more particularly by the accounts which i found on several of the monuments which are raised in every quarter of that ancient fabric some of them were covered with such extravagant epitaphs that if it were possible the dead person to be acquainted with them he would blush at the praises which his friends have bestowed upon him there are others so excessively modes t that they deliver the character of the person departed in greek or hebrew and by that means are not understood once in twelvemonth in the poetical quarter i found there were poets who had monuments and monuments which had poets i observed indeed that the present war had ﬁlled the church with many of these uninhabited monuments which had been erect ed to the memory of persons whose bodies were perhaps buried in the plains of blenheim or in the bosom of the ocean i could not but be very much delighted with several modern epitaphs which are written with great elegance of expression and justness of thought and therefore honor to the living well to the dead foreigner is very apt to conceive an idea of the ignorance or politeness of nation from the turn of their public monuments and inscriptions they should be submitted to the perusal of men of learning and genius before they are put in execution sir cloudesley shovel monument has very often given great offense instead of the brave rough english admiral which was the distinguishing character of that plain gallant man he is represented on his tomb by the ﬁgure of beau drest in long periwig and reposing himself upon velvet cushions under canopy of state the inscription is answerable to the monument instead of celebrating the many remarkable actions he had performed in the service of his country it acquaints us only with the manner of his death in which it was impossible him to reap any honor the dutch whom we are apt to despise want of genius show an inﬁnitely greater taste of antiquity and politeness in their buildin gs and works of this nature than what we meet with in those of our own country the monuments of their admirals which have been erected at the public expense represent them like themselves and are adorned with rostral crowns and naval ornaments with beautiful festoons of seaweed shells and coral 237 238 239 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https to return to our subject i have left the repository of our english kings the contemplation of another day when i shall ﬁnd my mind disposed so serious an amusement i know that entertainments of this nature are apt to raise dark and dismal thoughts in timorous minds and gloomy imaginations but my own part tho i am always serious i not know what it is to be melancholy and can therefore take view of nature in her deep and solemn scenes with the same pleasure in her most gay and delightful ones by this means i can improve myself with those objects which others consider with terror when i look upon the tombs of the great every emotion of envy dies in when i read the epitaphs of the beautiful every inordinate desire goes out when i meet with the grief of parents upon tombstone my heart melts with compassion when i see the tomb of the parents themselves i consider the vanity of grieving those whom we must quickly follow when i see kings lying by those who deposed them when i consider rival wits placed side by side or the holy men that divided the world with their contests and disputes i reﬂect with sorrow and astonishment on the little competitions factions and debates of mankind whe n i read the several dates of the tombs of some that died yesterday and some six hundred years ago i consider that great day when we shall all of us be contemporaries and make our appearance together ii will honeycomb and his marriage 116 my friend will honeycomb values hims elf very much upon what he calls the knowledge of mankind which has cost him many disasters in his youth will recko ns every misfortune that he has met with among the women and every encounter among the men parts of his education and fancies he should never have been the man he is had he not broke windows knocked down constables disturbed honest people with his midnight serenades and beat up phryne quarter s when he was young fellow the engaging in adventures of this nature will calls the studying of mankind and terms this knowledge of the town the knowledge of the world will ingenuously confesses that half his life his head ached every morning with reading of men over night and at present comforts himself under sundry inﬁrmities with the reﬂection that without them he could not have been acquainted with the gallantries of the age this will looks upon the learning of gentleman and regards all other kinds of science the accomplishments of one whom he calls scholar bookish man or philosopher these reasons will shines in mixed company where he has the discretion not to go out of his depth and has often certain way of making his real ignorance appear seeming one our club however has frequently caught him tripping at which times they never spare him will often insults us with the knowledge of the town we sometimes take our revenge upon him by our knowledge of books he was last week producing two or three letters which he writ in his youth to coquette lady the raillery of them was natural and well enough mere man of the town but very unluckily several of the words were wrong spelt will laughed this off at ﬁrst well he could but ﬁnding himself pushed on all sides and especially by the templar he told us with little passion that he never liked pedantry in spelling and that he spelt like gentleman and not like scholar upon this will had recourse to his old topic of showing the the pride and ignorance of pedants which he carried so far that upon my retiring to my lodgi ngs i could not forbear throwing together such reﬂections occurred to upon that subject man who has been brought up among books and is able to talk of nothing else is very indifferent companion and what we call pedant but methinks we should enlar ge 240 241 242 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https title and give it to every one that does not know how to think out of his profession and particular way of life what is greater pedant than mere man of the town bar him the catalog of the reigning beauties and an account of few fashionable distempers that have befallen him and you strike him dumb how many pretty gentleman knowledge lies all within the verge of the court he will tell you the names of the principal favorites repeat the shrewd sayings of man of quality whisper an intrigue that is not yet blown upon by common fame or if the sphere of his observation is little larger than ordinary will perhaps enter into all the incidents turns and revolutions in game of ombre when he has gone thus far he has shown you the whole circle of his accomplishments his parts are drained and he is disabled from any further conversation what are these but rank pedants and yet these are the men who value themselves most on their exemp tion from the pedantry of colleges i might here mention the military pedant who always talks in camp and is storming towns making lodgments and ﬁghting battles from one end of the year to the other everything he speaks smells of gunpow der if you take away his artillery from him he has not word to say himself i might likewise mention the law pedant that is perpetually putting eases repeating the transactions of westminster hall wrangling with you upon the most indifferent circums tances of life and not to be convinced of the distance of place or of the most trivial point in conversation but by dint of argument the state pedant is wrapt up in news and lost in politics if you mention either of the kings of spain or poland he talks very notably but if you go out of the gazette you drop him in short mere courtier mere soldier mere scholar mere anything is an insipid pedantic character and equally ridiculous of all the species of pedants which i have mentioned the book pedant is much the most supportable he has at least an exercised understanding and head which is full tho confused so that man who converses with him may often receive from him hints of things that are worth knowing and what he may possibly turn to his own advan tage tho they are of little use to the owner the worst kind of pedants among learned men are such are naturally endowed with very small share of common sense and have read great number of books without taste or distinction my friend will honeycomb who was so unmercifully witty upon the women in couple of letters which i lately communicated to the public has given the ladies ample satisfaction by marrying farmer daug hter piece of news which came to our club by the last post the templar is very positive that he has married dairymaid but will in his letter to on this occasion sets the best face upon the matter that he can and gives more tolerable account of his spouse i must confess i suspected something more than ordinary when upon opening the letter i found that will was fallen off from his former gaiety having changed dear spec which was his usual salute at the beginning of the letter into my worthy friend and subscribed himself at the latter end of it at full length william honeycomb in short the gay the loud the vain will honeycomb who had made love to every great fortune that has appeared in town above thirty years together and boasted of favors from ladies whom he had never seen is at lengt h wedded to plain country girl his letter gives us the picture of converted rake the sober character of the husband is dashed with the man of the town and enlivened with those little cant phrases which have made my friend will often thought very pretty company but let us hear what he says himself my w orthy f riend i question not but you and the rest of my acquaintance wonder that i who have lived in the smoke and gallantries of the town thirty years together should all on sudden grow fond of country life had not my dog of steward run away he did without making up his accounts i had still been 243 244 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https in sin and but since my late forced visit to my estate i am so pleased with it that i am resolved to live and die upon it i am every day abroad among my acres and can scarce forbear ﬁlling my letter with breezes shades ﬂowers meadows and purling streams the simplicity of manners which i have heard you so often speak of and which appears here in perfection charms wonderfully an instance of it i must acquaint you and by your means the whole club that i have lately married one of my tenants daughters she is born of honest parents and tho she has portion she has great deal of virtue the natural sweetness and innocence of her behavior the freshness of her complexion the unaffected turn of her shape and person shot through and through every time i saw her and did more execution upon in grogram than the greatest beauty in town or court had ever done in brocade in short she is such one promises good heir to my estate and if by her means i can not leave to my children what are falsely called the gifts of birth high titles and alliances i hope to convey to them the more real and valuable gifts of birth strong bodies and healthy constitutions your ﬁne women i need not tell thee that i know them i have had my share in their graces but more of that it shall be my business hereafter to live the life of an honest man and to act becomes the master of family i question not but i shall draw upon the raillery of the town and be treated to the tune of the match but i am prepared it i have been witty upon others in my time to tell thee truly i saw such tribe of fashionable young ﬂuttering coxcombs shot up that i did not think my post of an homme ruelle any longer tenable i felt certain stiffness in my limbs which entirely destroyed that jauntiness of air i was once master of besides i may now confess my age to thee i have been eight and forty above these twelve years since my retirement into the country will make vacancy in the club i could wish you would ﬁll up my place with my friend tom dapperwit he has an inﬁnite deal of ﬁre and knows the town my own part i have said before i shall endeavor to live hereafter suitable to man in my station prudent head of family good husband careful father when it shall so happen and your most sincere friend and humble servant william h oneycomb iii pride of bir th 117 horace juvenal boileau and indeed the greatest writers in almost every age have exposed with all the strength of wit and good sense the vanity of man valuing himself upon his ancestors and endeavored to show that true nobility consists in virtue not in birth with submission however to so many great authorities i think they have pushed this matter little too far we ought in gratitude to honor the posterity of those who have raised either the interest or reputation of their country and by whose labors we ourselves are more happy wise or virtuous than we should have been without them besides naturally speaking man bids fairer greatness of soul who is the descendant of worthy ancestors and has good blood in his veins than one who is come of an ignoble and obscure parentage these reasons i think man of merit who is derived from an illustrious line is very justly to be regarded more than man of equal merit who has claim to hereditary honors nay i think those who are indifferent in themselves and have 245 246 247 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https else to distinguish them but the virtues of their forefathers are to be looked upon with degree of veneration even upon that account and to be more respected than the common run of men who are of low and vulgar extraction after having thus ascribed due honors to birth and parentage i must however take notice of those who arrogate to themselves more honors than are due to them upon this account the ﬁrst are such who are not enough sensible that vice and ignorance taint the blood and that an unworthy behavior degrades and disennobles man in the eyes of the world much birth and family aggrandize and exalt him the second are those who believe new man of an elevated merit is not more to be honored than an insigniﬁcant and worth less man who is descended from long line of patriots and heroes or in other words behold with contempt person who is such man the ﬁrst founder of their family was upon whose reputation they value themselves but i shall chieﬂy apply myself to those whose quality sits uppermost in all their discourses and behavior an empty man of great family is creature that is scarce conversible you read his ancestry in his smile in his air in his eyebrow he has indeed nothing but his nobility to give employment to his thoughts rank and precedency are the important points which he is always discussing within himself gentleman of this turn began speech in one of king charles parliaments sir i had the honor to be born at time which rough honest gentleman took him up short i would fain know what that gentleman means is there any one in this house that has not had the honor to be born well himself the good sense which reigns in our nation has pretty well destroyed this starched behavior among men who have seen the world and know that every gentleman will be treated upon foot of equality but there are many who have had their education among women dependents or ﬂatterers that lose all the respect which would otherwise be paid them by being too assiduous in procuring it my lord froth has been so educated in punctilio that he governs himself by ceremonial in all the ordinary occurrences of life he measures out his bow to the degree of the person he converses with i have seen him in every inclination of the body from familiar nod to the low stoop in the i remember ﬁve of us who were acquainted with one another met toget her one morning at his lodgings when wag of the company was saying it would be worth while to observe how he would distinguish us at his ﬁrst entrance accordingly he sooner came into the room but casting his eye about my lord such one says he your most humble richard your humble our servant ducker how you frank are you there there is nothing more easy than to discover man whose head is full of his family weak minds that have imbibed strong tincture of the nursery younger brothers that have been brought up to nothing superannuated retainers to great house have generally their thoughts taken up with little else i had some years ago an aunt of my own by name martha ironside who would never marry beneath herself and is supposed to have died maid in fourscorth year of her age she was the chronicle of our family and passed away the greatest part of the last forty years of her life in recounting the antiquity marriages exploits and alliances of the ironsides martha conversed generally with knot of old virgins who were likewise of good families and had been very cruel all the beginning of the last century they were every one of them proud lucifer but said their prayers twice day and in all other respects were the best women in the world if they saw ﬁne petticoat at church they immediately took to pieces the pedigree of her that wore it and would lift up their eyes to heaven at the conﬁdence of the saucy minx when they found she was an honest tradesman daughter it is impossible to describe the pious indignation that would rise in them at the sight of man who lived plentifully on an estate of his own getting they were transported with zeal beyond measure if they heard of young woman matching into great family upon account only of her beauty her merit or her money in short 248 249 250 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https was not female within ten miles of them that was in possession of gold watch pearl necklace or piece of mechlin lace but they examined her title to it my aunt martha used to chide very frequently not sufﬁciently valuing myself she would not eat bit all dinner if at an invitation she found she had been seated below herself and would frown upon an hour together if she saw give place to any man under baronet i was once talking to her of wealthy citizen whom she had refused in her youth she declared to with great warmth that she preferred man of quality in his shirt to the richest man upon the change in coach and six she pretended that our family was nearly related by the mother side to half dozen peers but none of them knew anything of the matter we always kept it secret among ourselves little before her death she was reciting to the history of my forefathers but dwelling little longer than ordinary upon the actions of sir gilbert ironside who had horse shot under him at edgehi ll ﬁght i gave an unfortunate pish and asked what was all this to upon which she retired to her closet and fell three hours together in which time i afterwards found she struck out of her will and left all that she had to my sister margaret wheedling baggage that used to be asking questions about her from morning to night she now lies buried among the family of the ironsides with stone over her acquainting the reader that she died at the age of eighty years spinster and that she was descended of the ancient family of the ironsides after which follows the genealogy drawn up by her own hand iv sir roger and his home 118 the ﬁrst of our society is gentleman of worcestershire of ancient descent baronet his name sir roger coverley his was inventor of that famous which is called after him all who know that shire are very well acquainted with the parts and merits of sir roger he is gentleman that is very singular in his behavior but his singularities proceed from his good sense and are contradictions to the manners of the world only he thinks the world is in the wrong however this humor creates him enemies he does nothing with sourness or obstinacy and his being unconﬁned to modes and forms makes him but the readier and more capable to please and oblige all who know him when he is in town he lives in soho square it is said he keeps himself bachelor by reason he was crossed in love by perverse beautiful widow of the next county to him before this disappointment sir roger was what you call ﬁne gentleman had often supped with my lord rochester and sir geor ge etherege fought duel upon his ﬁrst coming to town and kicked bully dawson in public calling him youngster but being ill used by the mentioned widow he was very serious year and half and tho his temper being naturally jovial he at last got over it he grew careless of himself and never drest afterward he continues to wear coat and doublet of the same cut that were in fashion at the time of his repulse which in his merry humors he tells us has been in and out twelve times since he ﬁrst wore it he is now in his year cheerful gay and hearty keeps good house both in town and country great lover of mankind but there is such mirthful east in his behavior that he is rather beloved than esteemed his tenants grow rich his servants look satisﬁed all the young women profess love to him and the young men are glad of his company when he comes into house he calls the servant s by their names and talks all the way to visit i must not omit that sir roger is justice of the quorum that he ﬁlls the chair at quarter with great abilities and three months ago gained universal applause by explaining passage in the game act 251 252 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https often received an invitation from my friend sir roger coverley to pass away month with him in the country i last week accompanied him thither and am settled with him some time at his where i intend to form several of my ensuing speculations sir roger who is very well acquainted with my humor lets rise and go to bed when i please dine at his own table or in my chamber i think ﬁt sit still and say nothing without bidding be merry when the gentlemen of the country come to see him he only shows at distance i have been walking in his ﬁelds i have observed them stealing sight of over an hedge and have heard the knight desiring them not to let see them that i hated to be stared at i am the more at ease in sir roger family because it consists of sober and staid persons the knight is the best master in the world he seldom changes his servants and he is beloved by all about him his servants never care leaving him by this means his domestics are all in years and grown old with their master you would take his chambre his brother his butler is his groom is one of the gravest men that i have ever seen and his coachman has the looks of you see the goodness of the master even in the old and in gray pad that is kept in the stable with great care and tenderness out of regard to his past services tho he has been useless several years i could not but observe with great deal of pleasure the joy that appeared in the countenance of these ancient domestics upon my friend arrival at his some of them could not refrain from tears at the sight of their old master every one of them prest forward to something him and seemed discouraged if they were not employed at the same time the good old knight with mixture of the father and the master of the family tempered the inquiries after his own affairs with several kind questions relating to themselves this humanity and engages everybody to him so that when he is pleasant upon any of them all his family are in good humor and none so much the person whom he diverts himself with on the contrary if he coughs or betrays any inﬁrmity of old age it is easy stander to observe secret concern in the looks of all his servants my worthy friend has put under the particular care of his butler who is very prudent man and well the rest of his fellow servants wonderfully desirous of pleasing because they have often heard their master talk of of his particular friend my chief companion when sir roger is diverting himself in the woods or the ﬁelds is very venerable man who is ever with sir roger and has lived at his house in the nature of chaplain above thirty years this gentleman is person of good sense and some learning of very regular life and obliging conversation he heartily loves sir roger and knows that he is very much in the old knight esteem so that he lives in the family rather relation than dependent i have observed in several of my papers that my friend sir roger amidst all his good qualities is something of humorist and that his virtues well imperfection s are it were tinged by certain extravagance which makes them particularly his and distinguishes them from those of other men this cast of mind it is generally very innocent in itself so it renders his conversation highly agreeable and more delightful than the same degree of sense and virtue would appear in their common or ordinary colors i was walking with him last night he asked how i liked the good man whom i have just now mentioned and without staying my answer told that he was afraid of being insulted with latin and greek at his own table which reason he desired particular friend of his at the university to ﬁnd him out clergyman rather of plain sense than much learning of good aspect clear voice sociable temper and if possible man that understood little about backgammon my friend says sir roger found out this gentleman who besides the endowments required of him is they tell good scholar tho he does not show it i have given him the parsonage of the parish and because i know his value have settled upon him good annuity life if he outlives he shall ﬁnd that he was higher in my esteem than perhaps he thinks he is 253 254 255 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume iii of 10 great britain and https has now been with thirty years and tho he does not know i
