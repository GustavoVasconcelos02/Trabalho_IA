argosy january the silent chimes putting them up i hardly know whether to write this history or not its events did not occur within my own recollection and i can only relate them at the squire and others they are curious enough especially regards the three following upon their connection with the monk family causing end of talk in church leet parish well in other parishes within ear about three miles distance from church dykely going northwards across country was the rural parish of church leet it contained few farmhouses and some labourers cottages the church built of grey stone stood in its large the parsonage commodious house was close pg 1 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https both of them were covered with ivy nearly half mile off on gentle eminence rose the handsome mansion called leet hall the abode of the monk family nearly the whole of the houses church and to them at the time i am about to tell of they were the property of one monk the late owner of the place except one short twelvemonth was old james monk godfrey father old james had three sons and one wife dying early the eldest son mostly styled young james was about wild blade ever ﬁgured in story the second son raymond was an invalid the third godfrey reckless lad ran away to sea when he was fourteen if the monks were celebrated one estimable quality more than another it was temper imperious obstinate temper run away to sea has he cried old james when he heard the news very well at sea he shall stop and at sea godfrey did stop not disliking the life and perhaps not ﬁnding any other open to him he worked his way up in the merchant service by degrees until he became commander and was called captain monk the years went on young james died and the other two sons grew to be men old james the father found by signs and tokens that his own time was approaching and he was the next to go save slender income bequeathed to godfrey and to his daughter the whole of the property was left to raymond and to godfrey after him if raymond had son the entail had been cut of f in the past generation which act the reasons not concern us so raymond ailing greatly always entered into possession of his inheritance he lived about twelvemonth afterwards and then died died unmarried therefore godfrey came into all people were curious the squire says to what sort of man godfrey would turn out to be he had not troubled home much since he ran away he was widower that much was known his wife having been native of trinidad in the west indies handsome man with fair curling hair what was left of it proud blue eyes features with chronic ﬂush upon them he liked his glass and took it commanding imperious manner and temper uncompromising the grave such was captain godfrey monk now in his year upon his arrival at leet hall after landing with his children and one or two dusky attendants in their train he was received by his sister emma carradyne major carradyne had died ﬁghting in india and his wife at the request of her brother raymond came then to live at leet hall not of necessity carradyne was well off and could have made her home where she pleased but raymond had liked to have her godfrey also expressed his pleasure that she should remain she could act mother to his children godfrey children were three katherine aged seventeen hubert aged ten and eliza aged eight the girls had their father handsome features but in their skin there ran dusky tinge hinting of other than pure saxon blood and they were every whit haughtily he was the boy hubert was extremely pretty his face fair his complexion delicately beautiful his auburn hair bright his manner winning but he liked to exercise his own will and appeared to have generally done it day or two and carradyne sat down aghast i never saw children so troublesome and in all my life godfrey she said to her brother have they ever been controlled at all had their own way pretty much i expect answered the captain i was not often at home you know and there nobody else they obey well godfrey if i am to remain here you will have to help manage them that may be emma when i deem it necessary to speak i speak otherwise i interfere and you must not get into the habit of appealing to recollect captain monk conversation was sometimes interspersed with sundry light words not at all orthodox and not necessarily delivered in anger in those past days swearing was regarded gentleman accomplishment sailor it was believed could not at all get along without it manners change the present age prides itself upon its politeness but what of its sincerity pg 2 pg 3 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https carradyne mild and gentle commenced her task of striving to tame her brother rebellious children she might well have let it alone the girls laughed at her one minute and set her at deﬁance the next hubert who had good feeling was more obedient he did not openly defy her at times when her task pressed heavily upon her spirits carradyne felt tempted to run away from leet hall godfrey had run from it in the days gone by her own two children were frightened at their cousins and she speedily sent both to school lest they should catch their bad manners henry was ten the age of hubert lucy was between ﬁve and six just before the death of raymond monk the living of church leet became vacant and the last act of his life was to present it to worthy young clergyman named geor ge west this caused intense dissatisfaction to godfrey he had heard of the late incumbent death and when he arrived home and found the living ﬁlled up he proclaimed his anger loudly lavishing abuse upon poor dead raymond his precipitancy he had wanted to bestow it upon friend of his colonial chaplain and had promised it to him it was checkmate there was help now west could not be turned out again but captain monk was not accustomed to be checkmated and resented it accordingly he took up other reason most inveterate dislike to geor ge west and showed it practically in every step the vicar took at every turn and thought he found himself opposed by captain monk had he suggestion to make the welfare of the parish his patron ridiculed it did he venture to propose some wise measure at vestry meeting the captain put him and his measure down not civilly either but with stinging contempt though it was that made its impression on the farmers around the reverend geor ge west was man of humility given to much so he bore all in silence and hoped better times the time went on three years of it captain monk had fully settled down in his ancestral home and the neighbours had learnt what domineering man he was but he had his virtues he was kind in general way generous where it pleased him to be inordinately attached to his children and hospitable to fault on the last day of every year the years came round captain monk following his late father custom gave grand dinner to his tenan ts and very good custom it would have been but that he and they got rather too jolly the parson was always went and sometimes few of captain monk personal friends were added christmas came round this year usual and the invitations to the dinner went out one came to squire todhetley youngish man then and one to my father william ludlow who was younger than the squire it was green christmas the weather so warm and genial that the hearty farmers ﬂocking to leet hall declared they saw signs of buds sprouting in the hedges whilst the lar ge ﬁre in the captain was quite oppressive looking from the window of the parsonage in the twilight while drawing on his gloves preparatory to setting forth stood west his wife was bending over an in which their only child little alice lay back covered up her breathing was quick her skin parched with fever the wife looked sickly herself well i suppose it is time to go observed mr west slowly i shall be late if i i rather wonder you go at all geor ge returned his wife year after year when you come back from this dinner you invariably say you will not go to another i know it mary i dislike the drinki ng that goes the free the objectionable songs i feel out of place in it all and the captain contemptuous treatment of yourself you might add yes that is another unwelcome item in the evening programme then geor ge why you go well i think you know why i not like to refuse the invitation it would only increase captain monk animosity and widen still further the breach between us patron he holds so pg 4 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy

my duty lies in going but i shall not stay late mary added the parson bending to look at the suffering child and if you see any real necessity the doctor to be called in night i will go him lisped the little four maiden he kissed the little hot face said adieu to his wife and went out hoping that the child would recover without the doctor the living of church leet was but poor one though the parsonage house was so handsome it was pounds year which sum the tithes had been compounded and west had not much money to spare especially he had to substantially help his mother the twilight had deepened almost to night and the lights in the mansion seemed to smile cheerful welcome he approached it the pillared entrance ascended to by broad steps stood in the middle and raised terrace of stone ran along before the windows on either side it was quite true that every year at the conclusion of these feasts the vicar resolved never to attend another but he was essentially man of peace striving ever to lay oil upon troubled waters after the example left by his master dinner the board was full captain monk presided genial genial even to the parson squire todhetley faced the captain at the foot west sat at the squire right hand between him and farmer threpp quiet man and supposed to be very substantial one all went on pleasantly but when the elaborate dinne r gave place to dessert and the company became rather noisy i think it about time you left us cried the squire to young hube rt who sat next him on the other side and over and over again todhetley has repeated to us in later years the very words that passed by geor ge yes put in bluff and hearty the master of the hounds bending forward to look at the lad he was in line with him and breaking short off an anecdote he was regaling the company with i forgot you were there master hubert quite time you went to bed i daresay laughed the boy please let alone all of you i want attention drawn to but the slight commotion had attracted captain monk notice he saw his son what that what brings you there now you young pirate i ordered you to go out with the cloth i am not doing any harm papa said the boy turning his fair and beautiful face towards his father captain monk pointed his stern ﬁnger at the door mandate which hubert dared not disobey and he went out the company sat on an interminable period of time it seemed to the vicar he glanced stealthily at his watch eleven thinking of going parson said threpp i go with you my head not one of the strongest and i had about much i ought to carry they rose quietly not to disturb the table intending to steal away if possible without being observed unluckily captain monk chanced to be looking that way halloa who turning sneak you surely parson in meaningly contemptuous tone and you threpp of all men sit down again both of you if you want to quarrel with odds ﬁsh has my got sharks in it that you run away winter just lock the door will you you

quickly the glasses clicked the songs became louder the captain sea stories broader west perforce made the best of the situation certain words of holy writ running through his memory look not thou upon the wine when it is red when it giveth its colour in the cup when it moveth itself aright well more than well captain monk that he had not looked upon the red wine that night in the midst of all this the hall clock began to strike twelve the captain rose after ﬁlling his glass to the brim bumpers round gentlemen on your legs ready hooray here to the shade of the year that gone and may it have buried all our cares with it and here good luck to the one in happy new year to you all and may we never know moment in it worse than the present drain your glasses but we have had the toast too soon

the its chain and bunch of seals at the end hanging down by jupiter he exclaimed hang that butler of mine he knew the hall clock was too fast and i told him to put it back if his memory serves him better than this he may ship himself off to fresh listen it was the church clock striking twelve the sound reached the very clearly the wind setting that way another bumper cried the captain and his guests drank it this day twelvemonth i was at feast in derbyshire the bells of neighbouring church in the year with pleasant melody chimes they were remarked guest who was partial stranger your church has bells i suppose it has one an old that calls us to service on sunday said mr winter i like to hear those midnight chimes my part i like to hear them the new year went on the stranger chimes cried out captain monk who was getting very considerably elated why should we not have chimes mr west why we have chimes our church does not possess any this gentleman has just remarked was west answer egad but that parson of ours is going to set us all ablaze with his wit jerked out the captain ironically i asked sir why we should not get set of chimes i did not say we had got them is there any just cause or impediment why we should not mr vicar only the expense replied the vicar in conciliatory tone oh bother expense that what you are always wanting to groan over churchwarden threpp we will call vestry meeting and make rate the parish could not bear it captain monk remonstrated the clergyman you know what dissatisfaction was caused by the last extra rate put on and how low an ebb things are at just now when i will thing i it retorted the captain with meaning word or two we send out the rate and we get the chimes it will i fear lie in my duty to protest against it spoke the uneasy parson

others availed themselves of the opportunity to escape ii it perhaps did not surprise the parish to ﬁnd that its owner and master captain monk intended to persist in his resolution of embellishing the with set of they knew him too well to hope anything less why two years ago at the same annual feast some remarks or other at table put it into his head to declare he would stop up the public path by the rill and his obstinate will carried it out regardless of the inconvenience it caused vestry meeting was called and the rate to obtain funds the bells was at length passed two or three voices were feebly lifted in opposition west alone had courage to speak out but the captain put him down with his strong hand it may be asked why captain monk did not provide the funds himself this whim but he would never touch his own pocket the beneﬁt of the parish if he could help it and it was thought that his antagonism to the parson was the deterring motive to impose the rate was one thing to collect it quite another some of the poorer ratepayers protested with tears in their eyes that they could not pay superﬂuous rates really not necessary ones were perpetually being inﬂicted upon them they urged and were bringing them together with succession of recent bad seasons to the verge of ruin they carried their remonstrances to their vicar and he in turn carried them to captain monk it only widened the breach the more persistently though gently west pleaded the cause of his parishioners asking the captain to be considerate to them humanity sake the greater grew the other obstinacy in holding to his own will to be thus opposed roused all the devil within was his own expression and he grew to hate west with an exceeding bitter hatred the chimes were play one tune only west asked when the thing was absolutely inevitable that at least some sweet and sacred melody acceptable to ears might be chosen but captain monk ﬁxed on that was favourite of his own the bay of biscay at the end of every hour when the clock had struck the bay of biscay was to burst forth to charm the parish the work was put in hand at once captain monk ﬁnding the necessary funds to be repaid by the proceeds of the rate other expenses were involved such the strengthening of the belfry the rate was not collected quickly it was i say one of those times of scarcity that people used to talk so much of years ago and when the parish beadle who was the parish collector went round with the in his hand the poorer of the cottagers could not respond to it some of them had not paid the last levy and captain monk threatened harsh measures altogether what with one thing or another church leet that year was kept in state of ferment but the work went on one windy day in september west sat in his study writing sermon when jarring crash rang out from the church close by he leaped from his chair the unusual noise had startled him and it struck on every chord of vexation he possessed he knew that workmen were busy in the tower but this was the ﬁrst essay of the chimes the bells had clashed in some way one upon the other not giving out the bay of biscay or any other melody but very discordant jangle indeed it was the ﬁrst and the last time that poor geor ge west heard their sound he put the upon his sermon he was in mind to continue it then took up his hat and went out his wife spoke to him from the open window are you going out now geor ge tea is all but ready turning back on the path he passed into the cup of tea might soothe his nerves the stood on the table and west caddy in hand

on an errand and passed the cottage the chairs and tables were being put outside the door by two men she says brokers i conclude west made short work of his tea and started the scene thomas bean was very small farmer indeed renting about thirty acres what with the heavy rates he said and other outgoings and bad seasons and altogether he had been behind in his payments this long while and now the seemed to have come to climax bean and his wife were old their children were scattered abroad oh sir cried the old lady when she saw the vicar the tears raining from her eyes it can not be right that this oppression should fall upon us we had just knows how i sure i pay the midsummer rent and now they come upon us the rates and have took away things worth ten times the sum the rates mechanically spoke the vicar she supposed it was question yes sir two of we had in the house one was putting up the chimes and the i ca just remember what the other was the beadle old crow comes in sir this afternoon be the master says he over to side of church dykely says i says he upon that be going to have some visitors presently and it pity he out what crow says i you see says he then perhaps you

outside man to help him our middle table mahogany they seized and the handsome oak chest which had been our pride and the master there i ca go on west felt nearly sorrowful she and far more angry in his heart he believed that captain monk had done this oppressive thing in revenge great deal of had existed in the parish touching the rate made the chimes and the captain assumed that the few who had not yet paid it would not that they could not quitting the cottage in an impulse of anger he walked swiftly to leet hall it lay in his duty he fully deemed to avow fearlessly to captain monk what he

not long been reaped all around seemed to speak of peace to accommodate two gentlemen who had come from worcester that day to leet hall on business and wished to quit it again before dark the dinner had been served earlier than usual the guests had left but captain monk was seated still over his wine in the when west was shown in in crossing the hall to it he met carradyne who shook hands with him cordially captain monk looked surprised why this is an unexpected visit from you vicar he cried in mocking jest hope you have come to your senses sit down will you take port or sherry captain monk returned the vicar gravely he took the chair the servant had placed i am obliged your courtesy but i did not intrude upon you this evening to drink wine i have seen very sad sight and i am come hoping to induce you to repair it pg 9 pg 10 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https seen what cried the captain who it is well to mention had been taking his wine very freely even

that mr parson others are in the same condition the unable to pay these rates i pray you captain am here to pray to proceed in the same manner against them i would also pray you sir to redeem this act of oppression by causing their goods to be returned to these two poor honest people hold your tongue retorted the captain aroused to anger pretty example you set let you have your way every one of the lot shall be made to pay to the last farthing who the devil is to pay you suppose if they rates are imposed upon the parish needlessly captain monk it has been so ever since my time here pardon saying that if you put up chimes to gratify yourself you should bear the expense and not throw it upon those who have struggle to get bread to eat captain monk drank of f another glass any more treason parson yes said west if you like to call it so my conscience tells that the whole procedure in regard to setting up these chimes is so wrong so manifestly unjust that i have determined not to allow them to be heard until the rates levied them are refunded to the poor and oppressed i believe i have the power to close the and i shall act upon it by jove you think you are going to stand between and my will cried the captain passionately every individual who has not yet paid the rate shall be made to pay it morrow there is another world captain monk interposed the mild voice of the minister to which i hope we are if you attempt to preach to at this moment spoon fell to the ground by the sideboard the vicar turned to look his back was towards it the captain peered also at the end of the room when both became aware that one of the who had shown in there had stood there all the time what are you waiting sirrah roared his master we want you here put this window open an inch or two before you go the room close shall i bring lights sir asked michael after doing he was directed who wants lights stir the ﬁre into blaze michael left them it was from him that thus much of the conversation was subsequently known not ﬁve minutes had elapsed when commotion was heard in the then the bell rang violently and the captain opened the chair in his passage to shouted out light more than one servant ﬂew to obey the order in his hasty moods their master brooked not delay and three separate candles were carried in good lack master exclaimed the butler john rimmer who was native of church dykely

hearthrug near his chair his head resting close to the fender rimmer raised his head another servant took off his black it was only on high days that the poor vicar indulged in white one he gasped

before in the heigh t of health and strength had breathed his last how did it happen how could it have happened ay how indeed it was question which has never been entirely solved in church leet to this day captain monk account both privately and at the inquest was this they talked further together after michael left the room the vicar went on to browbeat him sham efully about the new chimes vowing they should never play never be heard at last rising in an access of passion the parson struck him the captain in the face he returned the would return it the vicar fell he believed his head must have struck against the iron fender in falling if not if the blow had been an unlucky one it took effect just behind the left ear it was only given in the jury composed of captain monk tenants expressed themselves satisﬁed and returned verdict of accidental death false account pronounced poor west in her dire tribulation my husband never struck he was not one to be goaded into unbecoming anger even by captain monk geor ge struck blow whatever i can answer it if ever man was murdered he has been curious rumours arose it was said that carradyne taking the air on the terrace outside in the calmness of the autumn evening heard the fatal quarrel through the open window that she heard west after he had received the death blow wail forth prophecy or whatever it might be called that those chimes would surely be accursed that whenever their sound should be heard so long they were suffered to remain in the tower it should be the signal of woe to the monk family carradyne utterly denied this she had not been on the terrace at all she said upon which the onus was shifted to michael who it was suspected had stolen out to listen to the end of the quarrel and had heard the ominous words michael in his turn also denied it but he was not believed anyway the covert whisper had gone abroad and would not be laid iii captain monk speedily ﬁlled up the vacant living appointing to it the reverend thomas dancox an occasional visitor at leet hall who was looking out one the new vicar turned out to be man after the captain heart rollicking jovial young parson many parson was in those took small blame to himself it he was only year or two past thirty of taking manners and with the parish in general who liked him and called him to his face tom dancox all this pleased captain monk but very soon something was to arrive that did not please suspicion that the young parson and his daughter katherine were on rather too good terms with one another one day in november he stalked into the where katherine was sitting with her aunt hubert and eliza were away at school also carradyne two children was dancox here last night began captain monk yes replied carradyne and the evening

own tone an angry one well i hope that is so i should not like to think otherwise anyway word in season does harm and take you notice that i have spoken it you also emma he left the room carradyne

i were to if he did not scornfully returned katherine what then aunt emma be silent child you must not talk in that strain your papa is perfectly right in this matter tom dancox is not suitable in any

with dancox into the parsonage while he searched book he was about to lend her that was the plea the truth doubt being that the two wanted bit of chat in quiet had it when she was coming out again the parson in attendance on her far the gate captain monk came by scene ensued captain monk in terrible access of passion vowed by all the laws of the medes and persians which alter not that never in life or after death should those two rebellious ones be man and wife and he invoked penalties on their heads should they dare to contemplate disobedience to his decree thenceforth there was more open rebellion upon the surface all looked smooth captain monk understood the folly to be at an end that the two had come to their senses and he took tom dancox back into favour carradyne assumed the same but katherine had her father unyielding will and the parson was bold and careless and in love the last day of the year came round and the usual banquet would come with it the weather this christmas was not like that of last the white snow lay on the ground the cold biting frost hardened the glistening icicles on the trees and the chimes ready these three months past they had not yet been heard they would be night whether captain monk wished the remembrance of west death to die away bit ﬁrst or that he preferred to open the treat on the banqueting night certain it was that he had kept them silent when the church clock should toll the midnight knell of the old year the chimes would ring out to welcome the new one and gladden the ears of church leet but not without remonstrance that morning the captain sat in his study writing letter carradyne came to him godfrey she said in low and pleading tone you will not suffer the chimes to play will you pray not not suffer the chimes to play cried the captain but indeed i shall why this is the special night they were put up i know it godfrey can not think what feeling i have against it an instinct it seems to the chimes have brought nothing but discomfort and disaster yet they pg 14 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https bring more in the future captain monk stared at her what d mean emma i would never

grace from the post of honour at the captain right hand captain monk did not appear to feel any remorse or regret he was jovial free and grandly hospitable one might suppose he had promoted the dead

they ever had been and hubert was allowed to sit on possibly the shadow of geor ge west unhappy death lay insensibly upon the party it was about nine when the butler came into the room bringing small note twisted up to his master from carradyne captain monk opened it and held it towards one of the lighted branches to read the few words it contained gentleman is asking to speak wor d to mr dancox he says it is captain monk tore the paper to bits not tell your mistress is my answer said he to rimmer hubert you can go to your aunt now it past your there could be appeal the boy knew but he went off unwillingly and in bitter resentment against carradyne he supposed she had sent him what cross old thing you are aunt emma he exclaimed he entered the on the other side the hall you wo let harry go in at all to the banquets and you wo let stay at them papa think he let remain there to hear the chimes why need you have interfered to send i neither interfered with you hubert nor sent you gentleman who did not give his name and preferred to wait outside wants to see dancox that all said carradyne you gave my note to your master rimmer yes replied the butler my master bade say to you that his answer was not night katherine monk her face betraying some agitation rose from the piano was the message not given to mr dancox she asked of rimmer not while i was there miss katherine the master tore the note into bits after reading it and dropped them under the table pg 15 pg 16 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https it chanced that dancox glancing covertly at the note while the captain held it to the light had read what was written there few minutes he said nothing the captain was busy sending round the wine captain saw my name on that bit of paper it caught my eye you held it out he said in low tone am i called out is anyone in the parish dying thus questioned captain monk told the truth one was dying and he was not called out to the parish some gentleman was asking to speak to him only that well i just see who it is and what he wants said dancox rising wo be away two minutes sir bring him back with you tell him he ﬁnd good wine here and jolly cheer said the captain and mr dancox went out swinging his in his hand in crossing the hall he met katherine exchanged hasty word with her let fall the serviette on chair he caught up his hat and overcoat and went out katherine ran upstairs hubert lay down on one of the sofas in point of fact that young gentleman could not walk straight little wine takes effect on youngsters especially when they are not accustomed to it carradyne told hubert the best place him was bed not bit of it the boy answered he should go out on the terrace at twelve the chimes would be ﬁne heard out there he fell asleep almost he spoke presently he woke up feeling headachy cross and stupid and of his own accord went up to bed meanwhile the was getting jollier and louder the time passed on towards midnight great wonder was expressed at the of the parson somebody must be undoubtedly grievously sick or dying speck the quiet little hurst leet doctor dissented from this nobody was dying in the parish he afﬁrmed or sick enough to need priest proof of it he had not been sent ring ring ring broke forth the chimes on the quiet midnight air the church clock ﬁnished striking twelve it was sweet sound even those prejudiced against the chimes could hear that the windows had been opened in readiness the glasses were charged the company stood on their legs some of them not at all steady legs just then bending their ears to listen captain monk stood in his place majestically waving his head and his left hand to keep time in harmony with the bay of biscay his right hand held his goblet in readiness the toast when the sounds should cease ring ring ring chimed the last strokes of the bells dying away to faintness on the still evening air suddenly amidst the hushed silence and whilst the sweet melody fell yet unbroken on the room there arose noise of something falling outside on the terrace mingled with wild scream and the crash of breaking glass one of the guests rushed to the window and put his head out of it so far he could see he said perhaps his sight was somewhat obscured it was lying further up on the terrace thrown out from one of the upper wind ows scornfully pronounced the captain full of wrath that it should have happened at that critical moment to mar the dignity of his coming toast and he gave the toast heartily and the new year came in them all with good wishes and good wine some little time yet ere the company ﬁnally rose the mahogany frame of the broken glass standing on end was conspicuous on the white ground in the clear frosty night they streamed out from the house speck whose sight was rather remarkably good peered at it curiously from the hall steps and then walked quickly along the snowy terrace towards it sure enough it was broken in its fall from an open window above but lying by it in the deep snow in his white nightshirt was hubert monk when the chimes began to play hubert was not asleep sitting up in bed he disposed himself to listen after bit they began to grow fainter hubert impatiently dashed to the window and threw it up to its full height he jumpe d on the when in some unfortunate way he overbalanced himself and pitched out on the terrace beneath carrying the with pg 17 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https the fall was not much his room was in one of the wings the windows of which were low but the boy had struck his head in falling and there he had lain insensible on the terrace one hand still clasping the all the rosy fading away to sickly paleness on the captain face he looked down on his son the boy was carried indoors to his room reviving with the movement young bones are elastic pronounced speck when he had examined him and none of these are broken he will probably have cold from the exposure that about the worst he seemed to have it already he was shivering from head to foot now he related the above particulars all the family had assembled round him except katherine where is katherine suddenly inquired her father noticing her absence i can not think where she is said carradyne i have not seen her an hour or two eliza says she is not in her room i sent her to see she is

people such few individuals or circumstances have power to call forth the work she has set herself to regardless of the dangers and difﬁculties she will have to encounter seems to us who look out from the security of our homes in this favoured land almost beyond human power to perform it is in fact appalling even miss nightingale who never exaggerates writes of this lady surely human being ever needed the loving father help and guidance more than this brave woman and in this the readers of the rgosy will fully agree her purpose is to travel through russia to the extreme points of siberia chieﬂy the purpose of seeing the condition of those affected with incurable disease and what can be done to improve their surroundings and mitigate their suf ferings this if it stood alone would be grand work but it is by means all she hopes to it is her purpose to join the gangs of exiles on their way to siberia to note their treatment to halt at their and see if it be true that there is an utter absence of all sanitary appliances that ﬁlth and cruelty are in evidence and that the strongest constitutions break down under conditions unﬁt brute beasts she will investigate the assertions that delicate innocent women and children are chained to vile criminals and so made to take their way on foot thousands of miles to siberia often other crime than some careles s words spoken against the greek church or the czar she hopes fully to inspect the prisons and mines in those regions described by the russians themselves living tombs she will if possible go into the cells of the condemned exiles whose walls are bare except their living covering of myriads of insects and lastly she intends to visit the jews quarters and satisfy our minds to the existenc of the terrible cruelties inﬂicted upon this persecuted race the hearing of which alone is and all through her perilous journeys we may be sure she will lose opportunity of comforting and helping the suffering ones who come under her notice matter what their race or condition this line of conduct will have its dangers but she holds not her life dear unto her so that she may accomplish her heart desire the practical result looked forward to by her is that having gained an intimate knowledge of the sufferings and cruelties inﬂicted upon so many thousands of russian subjects and of which there have been such conﬂicting accounts she may be admitted second time into the presence of the empress there to place the actual scenes before her and to plead the cause of the suf ferers personally strange to say she is convinced in her own mind that the emperor and empress of russia are ignorant of great deal that is done in their name or the phrase is by order of the czar and that they know little of the results of those edicts and ukase which are causing such dire misery to thousands of their subjects not only to the fering jews but also to christian women and children and it is her belie f that if the truth could be placed before them she hopes to place it they will attack the evil even at the cost of life or crown this is quite different view from that which obtains generally and if miss kate marsden should be able to prove her point and bring before them the pictures of what she may see on her journey to and from siberia she will score result such has fallen to one endeavour hitherto it is only now and then in lifetime that we meet woman capable of such grand work this which miss kate marsden has taken upon herself and the reason is that the qualiﬁcations necessary are so rarely found in combination in one and the same individual many among us may have one or other of the characteris tics but it is the existence of them all in one person that makes the heroine and gives the power you can not be an hour in miss kate marsden company without becoming aware of her enthusiasm her courage her her fearlessness and above all her simple faith it avails nothing that you place before her the trials the horrors the dangers the possible failure of such an undertaking hers the necessity of the work to be done she considers imperative and the certainty in her mind that it is her mission to it carries all before it pg 20 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https bravest among us would hesitate before deciding upon tour in russia and siberia supposing it were one of pleasure or of scientiﬁc research because even under these favourable conditions we should be subject to ignominious surveillance night and day and the chances of leaving the country when we pleased

fear and which very shame the century in which we live we try hard not to believe it is if with eyes open she walked into den of lions and expected them to give her loving welcome and free egress heaven help her she is in the midst of it and has begun her work the result of her fearlessness remains to be seen i doubt greatly whether we shall be allowed to receive reports of her daily life out there even where postal regulations are in force we can but follow her on her way from moscow to tomsk in thought and picture to ourselves the thousands of exiles she will ﬁnd waiting there herded together like brute beasts she will not turn from them even though typhoid be raging amongst can see her moving in and out among these miserable debased human beings who lie tossing on those terrible wooden shelves helping them according to their needs she carries with her remedies pain and disease of body and her simple faith will ﬁnd means of comforting heart and soul if any of those twenty thousand exiles who have this year trod the weary way between petersbur g and tomsk and on again to the districts of siberia should hear of the coming of this gentle woman strong only in her love them i think it would kindle spark of hope again in their hearts they would know that at least they were remembered by someone in the land of the living miss kate marsden has dared so much these poor suffering ones that she will not easily be turned aside by excessive politeness or brutality on the part of ofﬁcials from seeing the actual state of things she will not i think be content with viewing the provincial prison at tomsk which is light and airy and occupied by local offenders instead of the forwar ding prison which according to the accounts that reach us is disgrace to the civilized world and where the exiles are lodged while waiting to be forwarded i pity miss kate marsden if it should ever be her lot to witness the knout used to woman without the power of stopping it or retaliating upon the brute who is inﬂicting it it would be almost the death of her if we have been successful in interesting the readers of the rgosy in this lady and her mission they will like to know that she is not wilful person starting off on chase on generous impulse without at all counting the cost on the contrary the work she is now doing has been the desire of her life and all the training and discipline to which she has subjected herself has been the purpose of ﬁtting her it from her earliest childhood she has been an indefatigable worker among the sick and wounded with whom she has ever had the most intense sympathy and consequently an extraordinary power to soothe and comfort young she was at the time of the war she did good service on the and worked untiringly among every kind of depressing surrounding the beautiful cross upon her breast is gift from the empress of russia recognition of the good work she did among the wounded soldiers at that time from that day to this whether in england or in new zealand her work has been steadily going on ever gaining information and experience and at the same time doing an amount of good difﬁcult to calculate one whole year she became what i call want of better name an itinerant teacher of ambulance work in places out of reach of doctors in new zealand she taught the people how to deal with accidents caused by the falling of trees cuts with the axe or kicks from vicious horses all of which are of frequent occu rrence in the bush again she taught the miners how to make use of surrounding materials in case of an injury how to bandage and how to make stretcher moving wounded person from one place to another with such things were handy with two poles and man coat the poles to be placed through the arms and the coat itself to be buttoned securely over the poles another thing she taught in these way places was how to deal with burns and foreign matter in the eye or accidents of frequent occurrence pg 21 pg 22

work she is now doing it is work we all want done and would gladly take part in had we the qualiﬁcations it it is work which if well and honestly done will deserve the best thanks of england and of the whole civilized world she may not live to tell us but her life will not have been lived in vain if she prove successful in getting at the truth of what is done by order of the czar and presenting it to the czar himself we can not travel with her bodily we can not hunger or perish with cold in her company we can not ﬁght with dogs and wolves she must we can not with her go into the dens of

said chirper the overworked oldish young person whose duty it was to attend to the innumerable wants of the young lady boarders of park hill seminary she had just written out in large sprawling hand card above which card was presently to be nailed on to the one small box that held the whole of my worldly belongings and i think miss added chirper meditatively she held out the card at arm length and gazed at it admiringly that if i was to write out another card similar and tie it round your arm it would mayhap help you in getting safe to your journey end i girl of twelve was the janet hope indicated above and i had been lookin g over chirper shoulder with wondering eyes while she addressed the card but who is lady chillington and where is deepley walls and what have i to with either chirper please i asked if there is one thing in little girls more hateful than another it is curiosity answered chirper with her mouth of nails curiosity has been the bane of many of our sex witness bluebeard unhappy wife if you want to know more you must ask whitehead i have my instructions and i act on them meeting whitehead later she was coming down the stone corridor that led from the refectory i did ask that lady precisely the same questions that i had put to chirper her frosty glance ﬁlled with cold surprise smote even through her spectacles and i shrank little abashed at my own boldness pg 23 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https the habit of asking questions elsewhe re than in the should not be encouraged in young ladies said whitehead with sort of prim severity the other young ladies are gone home you are about to follow their example but i pleaded i never had any other home than park hill more questioning miss hope fie fie and with lean ﬁnger uplifted in menacing reproval whitehead sailed on her way nor deigned another word i stole out into the playground wondering wretched and yet smitten through with faint delicious thrillings of happiness such i had often dreamed of but had scarcely dared hope ever to realise i janet hope going home it was almost too incredible belief i wandered about like one one who stepping suddenly out of darkness into sunshine is dazzled by an intolerable brightness whichever way he turns his eyes and yet i was wretched was not miss chinfeather dead and that too was fact almost too incredible belief i wandered this autumn morning up and down the solitary playground i went back in memory far memory would carry but only to ﬁnd that miss chinfeather and park hill seminary blocked up the way beyond them lay darkness and mystery any events in my child life that might have happened before my arrival at park hill had authentic existence i had been part and parcel of miss chinf eather and the seminary so long time that i could not dissociate myself from them even in thought other pupils had had holidays and letters and presents and dear ones at home of whom they often talked but there had been none of these things i knew that i had been placed at park hill when very little girl by some to mysterious and unknown person but further than that i knew nothing the mistress of park hill had not treated in any way differently from her other pupils but had not the bills contracted on my account been punctually paid by somebody i am afraid that the justice on which she prided in conjunction with her aquiline nose and certain antique severity of deportment caused her to be known amongst us girls the roman matr have been somewhat rufﬂed and that sentence of expulsion from those classic walls would have been promptly pronounced and promptly carried into ef fect happily such necessity had ever arisen and now the roman matron lay dead in the little corner room on the second ﬂoor and had done with pupils and half yearly accounts and antique deportment ever in losing miss chinfeather i felt though the corner of my life had been rent away she was too cold she was altogether too far removed to regard her with love or even with that modiﬁed feeling which we call affection but then such demonstration was looked by miss chinfeather it was weakness above which she rose superior but if my child love was gift which she would have despised she looked and claimed my resignation of my will to hers the absorption of my individuality in her own the gradual elimination from my life of all its colour and freshness she strove earnestly and with inﬁnite patience to change from dreamy passionate child full of strange wild moods capricious and yet easily touched either to laughter or prim and elegant young lady colourless and formal and of the most orthodox pattern and if she did not quite succeed in the attempt the fault such it was must be set down to my obstinate disposition and not to any lack of effort on the part of miss chinfeather and now this powerful inﬂuence had vanished from my life from the world itself swiftly and silently snow ﬂake in the sun the grasp of the hard but not unkindly hand that had held so ﬁrmly in the narrow groove in which it wished to move had been suddenly relaxed and everything around seemed tottering to its fall three nights ago miss chinfeather had retired to rest well to all appearance and cheerful ever she had been next morning she had been found dead in bed this was what they told us pupils but so great was the awe in which i held the mistress of park hill seminary that i could not conceive of death even venturing to behave disrespectfully towards her i pictured him in my girlish fancy knocking at her chamber door in the middle of the night and after apologising the interruption asking whether she was ready to accompany him then would she who was thus addressed arise and wrap an ample robe about her and place her hand with solemn sweetness in that of the great captain and the two would pass out together into the starlit night and miss chinfeather would be seen of mortal eyes nevermore pg 24 pg 25 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https was the picture that had haunted my brain two days and many nights while i wandered forlorn through house and playground or lay awake on my little bed i had said farewell to one pupil after another till all were gone and the riddle which i had been putting to myself continually the last eight hours had now been solved by whitehead and i had been told that i too was going home to the care of lady chillington deepley walls midlandshire the words repeated themselves again and again in my brain and became greater puzzle with every repetition i had never to my knowledge heard of either the person or the place i knew nothing of one or the other i only knew that my heart thrilled strangely at the mention of the word home that unbidden tears started to my eyes at the thought that perhaps that yet unknown place there might be someone who would love just little i spoke the words but they sounded unreal to and if uttered by anothe i spoke them again holding out my arms and crying aloud all my heart seemed to go out in the cry but only the hollow winds answered they piped mournfully through the yellowing leaves throng of which went rustling down the walk though stirred by the footsteps of ghost then my eyes grew blind with tears and i wept silently time if my heart would break but tears were forbidden luxury at park hill and when little later on i heard chirper calling by name i made haste to dry my eyes and compose my features she scanned narrowly i ran up to her you dear little thing she said and with that she stooped suddenly and gave hearty kiss that might have been heard dozen yards away i was about to ﬂing my arms round her neck but she stopped saying that will dear whitehead is waiting us at the door whitehead was watching us throu gh the glass door which led into the playground the coach will be here in miss hope she said so that you have not much time your preparations i stood like one stunned moment or two then i said if you please whitehead may i see miss chinfeather before i go her thin straight lips quivered slightly but in her eyes i read only cold disapproval of my request really she said what singular child you must be i scarcely know what to say oh if you please i urged miss chin feather was always kind to i remem ber her long i can remember anything to see her once the last time it would seem to cruel to go away without follow she said almost in whisper so i followed her softly up stairs into the little corner room where miss chinfeather lay in white and solemn state grandly indifferent to all mundane matters i gazed it seemed but an hour ago since i had heard those still lips conjugating the verb mourir the behoof of poor ignorant and the words came back to and i could not help repeating them to myself i looked je meurs meurs etc i bent over and kissed the forehead and said farewell in my heart and went downstairs without word later the district coach splendid vision pulled up impetuously at the gates i was ready to the moment whitehead frosty ﬁngers touched mine an instant she imprinted chill kiss on my cheek and looked relieved my dear miss hope and god bless you she said strive to bear in mind through after life the lessons that have been instilled into you at park hill seminary present my respectful compliments to lady chillington and not forget your catechism at this point the guard sounded an impatient summons on his bugle chirper picked up my box seized by the hand and hurried with to the coach my luggage found place on the roof i was unceremoniously bundled inside chirper gave another of her hearty kisses and pressed crooked sixpence into my hand luck she whispered i am sure there was real tear in her eye she did so next moment we were of i kept my eyes ﬁxed on the seminary long it remained in view especially on the little corner room it seemed to that i must be very wicked girl indeed becau i felt real sorrow at quitting the place that had been my home so many years i could not feel anything but secretly glad but furtively happy with happiness which i felt ashamed of acknowledging even to myself miss chinfeather white and solemn face seen in her cofﬁn haunted my pg 26 pg 27 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https but even of her i thought only with sort of chastened regret she had never touched my heart there had been about her bleakness of nature that effectually chilled any tender buds of liking or affection that might in the ordinary course of events have grown up and blossomed round her life therefore in my child heart there was lasting sorrow her death gracious memories of her that would stay with and smell sweet long after she herself should be dust my eight miles ride by coach was soon over it ended at the railway station of the county town the guard of the coach had i suppose received his secret instructions almost before i knew what had happened i found myself in carriage with ticket eastbury in my hand and committed to the care of another guard he of the railway this man with immense red whiskers who came and surveyed though i were some contraband article but ﬁnished by nodding his head and saying with smile i dessay we shall be good friends miss before we get to the end of our journey it was my ﬁrst journey by rail and the novelty of it ﬁlled with wonder and delight the train by which i travelled was fast one and after my ﬁrst feeling of fright at the rapidity of the motion had merged into one of intense pleasure and exhilaration of mind i could afford to look back on my recent coach experience with sort of pitying superiority on something that was altogether rococo and out of date already the rash of new ideas into my mind was so powerful that the old landmarks of my life seemed in danger of being swept clean away already it seemed days instead of only brief hour or two since i had bidden whitehead farewell and had taken my last look at park hill seminary the guard was good his word he and i became famous friends before i reached the end of my journey at every station at which we stopped he came to the window to see how i was getting on and whether i was in want of anything and was altogether so kind to that i was quite sorry to part from him when the train reached eastbury and left minute later standing solitary waif on the little platform the one solitary ﬂy of which the station could boast was laid under contribution my little box was tossed on to its roof i myself was shut up inside the word was given to deepley walls the station was left behind and away we went jolting and rumbling along the quiet country lanes and under trees all aglow just now with autumn beauty the afternoon was closing in and the wind was rising sweeping up with melancholy soughs from the dim wooded hollows where it had lain asleep till the sun went down garner ing up the fallen leaves like cunning miser wherever it could ﬁnd them and then dying suddenly down and seeming to hold its breath if listening the footsteps of the coming winter in the western sky hung huge tumbled wrack of molten cloud like the ruins of some vast temple of the gods of eld chasmed buttresses battlements overthrown on the horizon press of giants shoulder against shoulder climbing slowly to the rescue in praying woman farther aﬁeld huge head and severed arm the ﬁngers of which were clenched in menace all these things i saw and score others the clouds changed from minute to minute in form and brightness while the stars began to glow out like clusters of silver lilies in the eastern sky we kept jolting on so long time through the twilight lanes and the even ing darkened so rapidly that i began to grow frightened it was like being lifted out of dungeon when the old ﬂy drew up with jerk and shout of house there and when i looked out and saw that we were close to the lodge entrance of some park presently woman with child in her arms came out of the lodge and proceeded to open the gate us said the how johnny the woman shouted something in reply but i think the old fellow heard her ay ay he called out johnny will be famous young shaver one of these days and with that he whipped up his horse and away we went the drive up the avenue such at the time i judged it to be and such it proved to be did not occupy many minutes the ﬂy came to stand and the driver got down and opened the door now young lady here you are he said and i found myself in front of the main entrance to deepley walls pg 28 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https was too dark by this time to discern more than the merest outline of the place i saw that it was very large and i noticed that not even one of its hundred windows showed the least glimmer of light it loomed vast dark and silent if deserted by every living thing the old driver gave hearty pull at the bell and the mufﬂed clamour reached where i stood i was quaking with fears and apprehensions of that unknown future on whose threshold i was standing would love or hate open the doors of deepley walls i was strung to such pitch that it seemed impossible any lesser passion to be handmaiden to my needs what i saw when the massive door was opened was an aged woman dressed like superior domestic who in sharp accents demanded to know what we meant by disturbing quiet family in that unseemly way she was holding one hand over her eyes and trying to make out our appearance through the gathering darkness i stepped close up to her i am miss janet hope from park hill seminary i said and i wish to speak with lady chillington chapter ii the m istress of deepley walls the words were hardly out of my lips when the woman shrank suddenly back though struck by an invisible hand and gave utterance to an inarticulate cry of wonder and alarm then striding forward she seized by the wrist and drew into the ed hall child child why have you come here she cried scanning my face with eager eyes in all the wide world this is the last place you should have come to miss chinfeather is dead and all the young ladies have been sent to their homes i have home so they have sent here what shall i what will her ladyship say cried the woman in frightened voice how shall i ever dare to tell her who rang the bell dance few minutes ago and to whom are you talking the voice sounded so suddenly out of the at the upper end of the large hall which was lighted only by small oil lamp that both the woman and i started looking in the direction from which the sound had come i could dimly make out through the obscurity the ﬁgures of two women who had entered without noise through the curtained doorway close to which they were now standing one of the two was very tall and was dressed entirely in black the second one who was less tall was also dressed in black except that she seemed to have something white thrown over her head and shoulders but i was too far away to make out any details hush you speak whispered the woman warningly to leave to break the news to her ladyship with that she left standing on the threshold and hurried towards the upper end of the hall the tall personage in black then with the harsh pitched and slightly was lady chillington how fast my heart beat if only i could have slipped out unobserved i would never have braved my fortune within those walls again she who had been called dance went up to the two ladies curtsied deeply and began talking in low earnest voice hardly however had she spoken dozen words when the lesser of the two ladies ﬂung up her arms with cry like that of some wounded creature and would have fallen to the ground had not dance caught her round the waist and so held her what folly is this cried lady chillington sternly striking the pavement of the hall sharply with the iron ferrule of her cane to your room sister agnes such poor weak fools you solitude is the only safe companion but remember your oath not word not word with one lean hand uplifted and menacing foreﬁnger she emphasised those last warning words she who had been addressed sister agnes raised herself with deep sigh from the shoulder of dance cast one long look in the direction of the spot where i was standing and vanished pg 29 pg 30 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https through the curtained arch then dance took up the broken thread of her narration and lady chillington grim and motionless listened without word even after dance had done speaking her ladyship stood some time looking straight before her but saying nothing in reply i felt intuitively that my fate was hanging on the decision of those few moments but i neither stirred nor spoke at length the silence was broken by lady chillington take the child away she said attend to her wants make her presentable and bring her to in the green saloon after dinner it will be time enough to consider what must be done with her dance curtsied again her ladyship sailed slowly across the hall and passed out through another curtained doorway dance ﬁrst act was to pay and dismiss the driver who had been waiting outsi all this time then taking by the hand come along with dear she said why i declare you look quite white and frightened you have nothing to fear child we shall not eat least not just yet not till we have fed you up bit at the end of long corridor was dance own room into which i was now ushered scarcely had i made few changes in my toilette when tea two persons was brought in and dance and i sat down to table the old lady was well on with her second cup before she made any remark other than was required by the necessities of the occasion i have called her an old woman and such she looked in my youthful eyes although her years were only about sixty she wore dark brown dress and black silk apron and had on cap with thick frilled borders under which her grey hair was neatly snooded away she looked ruddy and full of health shrewd sensible woman evidently yet with motherly kindness about her that made cling to her with child unerring instinct you look tired poor thing she said she leisurely stirred her tea and well you may considering the long journey you have had i suppose that her ladyship will keep you more than ten minutes in the green saloon and after that you can go to bed soon you like what surprise all of us your coming has been dear dear who would have expected such thing this morning but i knew by the twitching of my corns that something uncommon was going to happen i was really frightened of telling her ladyship that you were here there knowing how she might have taken it and there knowing what she will decide to with you but what has lady chillington to with in any way i asked before this morning i never even heard her name and now it seems that she is to what she likes with that she will what she likes with you you may depend dear said dance to how she happens to have the right so to that is another thing and one about which it is not my place to talk nor yours to question that she possesses such right you may make yourself certain all that you have to is to obey and to ask questions i sat in distressed and bewildered silence little while then i ventured to say please not to think rude but i should like to know who sister agnes is dance stirred uneasily in her chair and bent her eyes on the ﬁre but did not immediately answer my question sister agnes is lady chillington companion she said at last she reads to her and writes her letters and talks to her and all that you know sister agnes is roman catholic and came here from the convent of saint ursula however she is not nun but something like one of those sisters of mercy in the large towns who go about among poor people and visit the hospitals and prisons she is allowed to live here always and lady chillington would hardly know how to get through the day without her is she not relative of lady chillington i asked not relative answered dance you must try to love her great deal my dear miss janet if angels are ever allowed to visit this vile earth sister agnes is one of them but there goes her ladyship bell she is ready to receive you pg 31 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https had washed away the stains of travel and had put on my best frock and dance was pleased to say that i looked very nice though perhaps triﬂe more than girl of your age ought to look then she laid down few rules my guidance when in the presence of lady chillington and led the way to the green saloon i following with timorous heart dance ﬂung open the of the big room miss janet hope to see your ladyship she called out and next moment the doors closed behind and i was left standing there alone come nearer said her ladyship cracked voice with long lean hand she beckoned to approach i advanced slowly up the room stopped and curtsied lady chillington pointed out high footstool about three yards from her chair i curtsied again and sat down on it during the interview that followed my quick eyes had ample opportunity taking mental inventory of lady chillington and her surroundings she had exchanged the black dress in which i ﬁrst saw her one of green velvet trimmed with ermine this dress was made with short sleeves and low body so to leave exposed her ladyship arms long lean and skinny and her scraggy neck her nose was hooked and her chin pointed between the two shone row of large white even teeth which long afterwards i knew to be artiﬁcial equally artiﬁcial was the mass of short black frizzly curls that crowned her head which was unburdened with cap or covering of any kind her eyebrows were dyed to match her hair her cheeks even through the powder with which they were thickly smeared showed two spots of brilliant red which one less ignorant than i would have accepted without question the last genuine remains of the bloom of youth but at that ﬁrst interview i accepted everything au pied la lettre without doubt or question of any kind her ladyship wore long earrings of ﬁligree gold round her neck was massive gold chain on her ﬁngers sparkled several rings of rubies and opals in ﬁgure her ladyship was tall and upright dart she was however slightly lame of one foot which necessitated the use of cane when walking lady chillington cane was and had gold plate let into it on which was engraved her crest and initials she was seated in an chair near table on which were the remains of dessert one person the green saloon was large gloomy room at least it looked gloomy i saw it the ﬁrst time lighted up by four wax candles where twenty were needed these four candles being placed close by where lady chillington was sitting left the other end of the saloon in comparative darkness the furniture was heavy formal and gloomy portraits of dead and gone chillingtons lined the green walls and this might be the reason why there always seemed to slight graveyard perceptible but none the less surely about this room which caused to shudder involuntarily whenever i crossed its threshold lady chillington black ge cold and steady juno been bent upon all this time measuring from head to foot with what i felt to be slightly contemptuous scrutiny what is your name and how old are you she asked with startling abruptness after minute or two of silence janet hope and twelve years i answered laconically feeling of deﬁance of dislike to this bedizened old woman began to gnaw my child heart young i was i had learned with what bitterness i alone could have told the art of wrapping myself round with husk of cold reserve which one uninitiated in the ways of children could penetrate unless i were inclined to let them sulki ness was the generic name this quality at school but i digniﬁed it with different term how many years were you at park hill seminary and where did you live before you went there asked lady chillington i have lived at park hill ever since i can remember anything i know where i lived before that time are your parents alive or dead if the latter what you remember of them lump came into my throat and tears into my eyes moment or two i could not answer pg 32 pg 33 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https i know anything about my parents i said i never remember seeing them i know whether they are alive or dead you know why you were consigned by the park hill people to this particular deepley in fact her voice was raised almost to shriek she said these last words and she pointed to herself with one ﬁnger i know why i was sent here i was told to come and i came but you have claim on whatever she continued ﬁercely bear that in mind remember it always whatever i may choose to you will be done of my own free will and not through compulsion of any kind claim whatever remember that none whatever she was silent some time after this and sat with her cold steady eyes ﬁxed intently on the ﬁre my part i sat still mouse afraid to stir longing my dismiss al and dreading to be questioned further lady chillington roused herself at length with deep sigh and few words muttered under her breath here is bunch of grapes you child she said when you have eaten them it will be time you to retire i advanced timidly and took the grapes with curtsey and thank you and then went back to my seat i sat eating my grapes my eyes went up to an oval mirror over the in which were reﬂected the ﬁgures of lady chillingt on and myself my momentary glance into its depths showed how keenly but furtively her ladyship was watching but what interest could great lady have in watching poor insigniﬁcant i ventured another glance into the mirror yes she looked if she were devouring with her eyes but hothouse grapes are nicer than mysteries and how is it possible to give one serious attention to two things at time when i had ﬁnished the grapes i put my plate back on the table ring that bell said lady chillington i rang it accordingly and presently dance made her appearance miss hope is ready to retire said her ladyship i arose and going step or two nearer to her i made her my most elaborate curtsey and said i wish your ladyship very the ghost of smile ﬂickered across her face i am pleased to ﬁnd child that you are not entirely destitute of manners she said and with stately wave of the arm i was dismissed it was like an escape from slavery to hear the door of the green saloon close behind and to get into the great corridors and passages outside i could have capered very glee only dance was staid sort of person and might not have liked it her ladyship is pleased with you i am sure she remarked we went along that is more than i am with her i answered pertly dance looked shocked you must not talk in that way dear on any account she said you must try to like lady chillington it is to your interest to so but even should you never learn to like her you must not let anyone know it i sure that i shall like the lady that you call sister agnes i said when shall i see her morrow dance looked at sharply moment you think you shall like sister agnes eh when you come to know her you will more than like her you will love her but perhaps lady chillington will not allow you to see her but why not i said abruptly and i could feel my eyes ﬂash with anger pg 34 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https the why not i am not at liberty to explain said dance drily and let tell you miss janet hope there are many things under this roof of which explanation will be given you and if you are wise good girl you will not ask too many questions i tell you this simply your own good lady chillington canno t abear people that are always prying and asking does this mean and does the other mean still tongue is the sign of wise head ten minutes later i had said my prayers and was in bed go without kissing i said to dance she took up the candle the old lady came back and kissed tenderly heaven bless you and keep you my dear she said with solemn dignity there are those in the world who love you very dearly and some day perhaps you will know all i dare not say more and god bless you dance words reached chord in my heart that vibrated to the slightest touch i cried myself silently to sleep how long i had been asleep i had means of knowing but i was awakened some time in the night by rain of kisses soft warm and light on lips cheeks and forehead the room was pitch dark and second or two i thought i was still at park hill and that miss chinfeather had come back from heaven to tell how much she loved but this thought passed away like the slide of magic lantern and i knew that i was at deepley walls the moment i knew this i put out my arms with the intention of clasping my unknown visitor round the neck but i was not quick enough the kisses ceased my hands met each other in the empty air and i heard faint noise of garments trailing across the ﬂoor i started up in bed and called out in frightened voice who there hush not word whispered voice out of the darkness then i heard the door of my room softly closed and i felt that i was alone i was left wide awake ever i had been in my life my child heart was ﬁlled with an unspeakable yearning and yet the darkn ess and the mystery frightened it could not be miss chinfeather who had visited i argued with myself the lips that had touched mine were not those of corpse but were instinct with life and love who then could my mysterious visitor be not lady chillington surely i half started up in bed at the thought just i did so without warning of any kind solemn mufﬂed tramp became audible in the room immediately over mine tramp slow heavy measured from one end of the room to the other and then back again i slipped back into the bedclothes and buried myself up to the ears i could hear the beating of my heart oppressed now with new terror before which the lesser one faded utterly the very monotony of that dull measured walk was enough to unstring the nerves of child coming it did in the middle of the night i tried to escape from it by going still deeper under the clothes but i could hear it even then since i could not escape it altogether i had better listen to it with all my ears it was quite possible that it might come down stairs and so into my room had such thing happened i think i should have died from sheer terror happily nothing of the kind took place and still listening i fell asleep at last from utter weariness and knew nothing more till i was awoke by stray sunbeam smiting across the eyes chapter iii voyage of discovery golden sunbeam was shining through crevice in the blinds the birds were twittering in the ivy outside oxen were lowing to each other across the park morning with all her music was abroad i started up in bed and rubbed my eyes within the house everything was mute the grave that horrible tramping overhead had ceased doubtless with the return of daylight which would otherwise have shifted it from the region of the weird to that of the commonplace i smiled to myself i thought of my terrors of the past night and felt brave enough just then to have faced thousand ghosts in another minute i was out of bed and had drawn up my blind and ﬂung open my window and was drinking in the sweet peaceful scene that stretched away before in long level lines to the edge of far horizon pg 35 pg 36 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https window was high up and looked out at the front of the hall immediately below was semicircular lawn shut in from the park by an invisible fence close shaven and clumped with baskets of ﬂowers glowing just now with all the brilliance of late autumn the main ﬂight of shallow steps and an ionic portico i afterwards at one end of the building and was reached by long straight carriage drive the route of which could be traced across the park by the thicker growth of trees with which it was fringed this park stretched to right and left mile either way in front it was bounded short away by the high road beyond which were level tching meadows through which the river adair washed slow and clear but chief of all this morning i wanted to be down among the ﬂowers i made haste to wash and dress taking an occasional peep through the window i did so and trying to entice the birds from their in the ivy then i opened my door and then in view of the great landing outside i paused severa l doors all except mine now closed gave admittance from this landing to different rooms both landing and stairs were made of oak black and polished with age one broad ﬂight of stairs with heavy carved banisters pointed the way below second and narrower ﬂight led to the regions above matter of course i chose the former but not till after minute hesitation to whether i should venture to leave my room at all before i should be called but my desire to see the baskets of ﬂowers prevailed over everything else i closed my door gently and hurried down i found myself in the of deepley walls into which i had been ushered on my arrival there were the two curtained doorways through which lady chillington had come and gone the rest it was gloomy place enough with its ﬂagged ﬂoor and its windows high up in the semicircular roof few rusty graced the walls the stairs were guarded by two efﬁgies in armour marble bust of one of the cæsars stood on high pedestal in the middle of the ﬂoor and that was all i was glad to get away from this dismal spot and to ﬁnd myself in the passage which led to the housekeeper room i opened the door and looked in but the room was vacant farther along the same passage i found the kitchen and other domestic ofﬁces the kitchen clock was just on the point of six i went in one serva nt alone had come down from her i inquired my way into the garden and next minute i was on the lawn the grass was wet with the heavy dew but my boots were thick and i heeded it not the ﬂowers were there within my very grasp oh those ﬂowers can i ever forget them i have seen none so beautiful since there can be none so beautiful out of paradise one spray of scarlet geranium was all that i ventured to pluck but the odours and the colours were there all comers and were much mine the time being if the ﬂowers themselves had belonged to sudden ly i turned and glanced up at the house with sort of guilty consciousness that i might possibly be doing wrong but the house was still shutters or blind at every window i saw before looking mansion with high slanting roof of not undigniﬁed appearance now that it was mellowed by age but with pretensions to architectural beauty the sole attempt at outside ornamentation consisted of few ﬂutings of white stone reaching from the ground to the second ﬂoor and terminating in oval shields of the same material on which had originally been carved the initials of the builder and the date of erection but the summer sun and the winter rain of many long year had rubbed both letters and ﬁgures carefully out long afterwards i knew that deepley walls had been built in the reign of the third william by certain squire chillington of that date out of my own head he himself put it in quaint document still preserved among the family archives and rather muddled head it must have been in matters architectural after this i ventured round by the main entrance with its gravelled carriage sweep to the other side of the house where i found long ﬂagged terrace bordered with large evergreens in tubs placed at frequent intervals on to this terrace several french windows windows i found later in the day of lady chillington private rooms to the left of this terrace stood plantation of young trees through which winding path that opened by wicket into the private grounds invited to penetrate through the green gloom i advanced bravely my heart beating with all the pleasure of one who was exploring some unknown land i saw living thing by the way save two grey rabbits that scuttered across my path and vanished in the under growth on the pg 37 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https side pretty frisky creatures how i should like to have caught them and fed them and made pets of them long they lived two or three hundred yards farther on the path ended with another wicket now locked which opened into the high road about mile away i could discern the roofs and chimneys of little town when i got back to the hall i found dear old dance getting rather anxious at my long absence but she brightened into smiles when i kissed her and told her where i had been you must have slept well or you would hardly look so rosy this morning she said we sat down to breakfast i should have slept very well if i had not been troubled by the ghosts ghosts my dear miss janet you not mean to and the old lady cheek paled suddenly and her cup rattled in her saucer she held it i mean to say that deepley walls is haunted by two ghosts one of which came and kissed last night when i was asleep while the other one was walking nearly all night in the room over mine dance face brightened but still wore puzzled expression you must have dreamed that someone kissed you dear she said if you were asleep you could not know anything about it but i was awakened by it and i am positive that it was dream then i told her what few particulars there were to tell the future we must lock your door she said then i should be more frightened than ever besides real ghost would not be kept out by locking the door well dear tell if you are disturbed in the same way again but the tramping you heard in the room overhead that is easily explained it was ghost that you heard walking but lady chillington then seeing my look of astonishment she went on to explain you see my dear miss janet her ladyship is very peculiar person and does many things that to commonplace people like you and may seem rather strange one of these little peculiarities is her fondness walking about the room over yours at night now if she likes to this i know of reason why she should not it it is little whim that does harm to anybody and the house and everything in it are her own she may surely please herself in such triﬂe but what is there in the room that she should prefer it to any other in the hous walking in by night the room said the old lady staring at across the table with strange frightened look in her eyes what curious question the room is common room of course with nothing in it out of the ordinary way only i said before it happens to be lady chillington whim to walk there so if you hear the noise again you will know how to account it and will have too much good sense to feel in the least afraid i had half consciousness that dance was prevaricating with in this matter or hiding something from but i was obliged to accept her version the correct one especially i saw that any further questioning would be of avail i did not see lady chillington that day she was reported to be unwell and kept her own rooms about noon message came from sister agnes that she would like to see in her room when i entered she was standing by square oak table resting one hand on it while the other was pressed to her heart her face was very pale but her dark eyes beamed on with veiled tenderness that i could not misinterpret miss hope she said offering her white slender hand my acceptance i fear that you will ﬁnd deepley walls even duller than park hill seminary her tone was cold and constrained i looked up earnestly into her face her lips began to quiver painfully child child you must not look at in that way she cried instinct whispered something in my ear you are the lady who came and kissed when i was asleep i exclaimed pg 38 pg 39 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https brow contracted moment if she were in pain hectic spot came out suddenly on either cheek and vanished almost swiftly yes it was i who came to your room last night she said y are not vexed with doing so on the contrary i love you it her smile the sweetest i ever saw beamed out at this gently she stroked my hair you looked so forlorn and weary last night she said that after i got to bed i could not help thinking about you i was afraid you would not be able to sleep in strange place so i could not rest till i had visited you but i never intended to awake you i not mind how often i am awakened in the same way i said one has ever seemed to love but you and i can not help loving you back my poor child was all she said we had sat down by this time close to the window and sister agnes was holding one of my hands in hers and caressing it gently she gazed dreamily across the park my eyes wandered from her to the room and then back again the picture still lives in my memory fresh though it had been limned but yesterday square whitewashed room ﬁtted up with furniture of unpolished oak on the walls few proof engravings of subjects taken from sacred history small bookcase in one corner and in another the ﬂoor uncarpeted but polished after the french fashion table lar ge workbox heap of clothing the poor and lastly stand ﬂowers the features of sister agnes were delicate and clearly cut those of some antique statue but their habitual expression was one of intense melancholy her voice was low and gracious the voice of reﬁned and educated gentlewoman her hair was black with here and there faint silver streak but the peculiar of white linen which she wore left very little of it visible disﬁguring this might have been to many people in her case it served merely to enhance the marble whiteness and transparent purity of her complexion her eyebrows were black and but the eyes themselves i can only repeat what i said their dark depths were full of tenderness and sort of veiled enthusiasm difﬁcult to describe in words her dress was black soft and coarse relieved by deep cuffs of white linen her solitary ornament if ornament it could be called was rosary of black beads not without reason have i been thus particular in describing sister agnes and her surroundings they who read will discover themselves sister agnes woke up from her reverie with sigh and began talking to about my schooldays and my mode of life at park hill seminary it was pleasure to to talk because i felt it was pleasure to her to listen to and she let talk on and on i ca tell how long only putting in question now and again till she knew almost much about miss chinfeather and park hill i knew myself but she never seemed to grow weary we were sitting close together and after time i felt her arm steal gently round my waist pressing closer still and so with my head nestling against her shoulder i talked on heedless of the time happy afternoon it was broken by summons sister agnes from lady chillington if the weather hold ﬁne we will go to charke forest and gather blackberries said sister agnes she gave parting kiss that night i went early to bed and never woke till daybreak chapter iv scarsdale w eir i was up betimes next morning long before sister agnes could possibly be ready to take to the forest so i took my sewing into the garden and found pleasant sunny nook where i sat and worked till breakfast time the meal was scarcely over when sister agnes sent it made my heart leap with pleasure to see how her beautiful melancholy face lighted up at my pg 40 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https why should she feel such an interest in one whom she had never seen till few hours ago the question was one i could not answer i could only recognise the fact and be thankful the morning was delicious sunny without being oppressive while in the shade there was faint touch of austerity like the ﬁrst breath of coming winter walk of two miles brought us to the skirts of the forest and in ﬁve minutes after quitting the high road we might have been hundred miles away from any habitation so utterly lost and buried from the outer world did we seem to be already the forest paths were half hidden by fallen leaves which rustled pleasantly under our feet we came to pretty opening in the wood where some charitable soul had erected rude rustic seat that was more than half covered with the initials of idle wayfarers here sister agnes sat down to rest she had brought volume of poems with her and while she read i wandered about never going very far away feasting on the purple blackberries ﬁnding here and there cluster of nuts trying to ﬁnd out nest or two among the thinned foliage and enjoying myself in quiet way much to my heart content i think sister agnes read much that morning her gaze was oftener away from her book than on it after time she came and joined in gathering nuts and blackberr ies she seemed brighter and happier than i had hitherto seen her entering into all my little projects with much eagerness though she were herself child how soon i had learned to love her why had i lived all those dreary years at park hill without knowing her but i could never again feel quite so quite such an outcast from that common household love which all the girls i had known seemed to accept matter of course even if i shoul d unhappily be separated from sister agnes i could not cease to love her and although i had seen her the ﬁrst time barely hours ago my child instinct told that she possessed that steadfastness sweet and strong which allows name that has once been written on its heart to be erased therefrom ever my thoughts were running in some such groove but they were all tangled and confused the luxuriant under growth around it must have been out of this confusion that the impulse arose which caused to address question to sister agnes that startled her much if shell had exploded at her feet dear sister agnes i said you seem to know my history and all about did you know my papa and mamma she dropped the leaf that held her fruit and turned on haggard frightened face that made my own grow pale what makes you think that i know your history she stammered out you who are so intimate with lady chillington must know why i was brought to deepley walls you must know something about if you know anything about my father and mother oh please tell please i am tired janet let us sit down she said wearily so hand in hand we went back to the rustic seat and sat down she sat minute or two without speaking gazing straight before her into some forest vista but seeing only with that inner eye which searches through the dusty chambers of heart and brain whenever some record of the past has to be brought forth to answer the questions of i know your history dear child she said at length and both your parents were friends of mine were then neither of them is alive alas they have been dead many years your father was drowned in one of the italian lakes your mother died year afterwards all the sweet vague hopes that i had cherished in secret ever since i could remember anything of some day ﬁnding at least one of my parents alive died out utterly sister agnes said these words my heart seemed to faint within i ﬂung myself into her arms and burst into tears very tenderly and lovingly with sweet caresses and words of comfort did sister agnes strive to win back to cheerfulness her efforts were not unsuccessful and after time i grew calmer pg 41 pg 42 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https recovered my and soon so much was accomplished we set out on our return to deepley walls we rose to go i said since you have told so much sister agnes will you not also tell why i have been brought to deepley walls and why lady chillington has anything to with that is question dear janet which i can not answer she said i am bound to lady chillington by solemn promise not to reveal to you the nature of the secret bond which has brought you under her roof that she has your welfare at heart you may well believe and that it is to your interest to please her in every possible way is equally certain more than this i dare not say except there are certain pages of your history some of them of very painful character which it would not be advisable that you should read till you shall be many years older than you are now meanwhile rest assured that in lady chillington however eccentric she may seem to be you have ﬁrm and powerful friend while in who have neither inﬂuence nor power you have one who simply loves you and prays night and day your welfare and you will never cease to love will you i said just we stepped out of the forest into the high road she took both my hands in hers and looked straight in the face never while i live janet hope can i cease to love you she said then we kissed and went on our way towards deepley walls you are to dine with her ladyship miss janet said dance the same afternoon we must look out your best bib and tucker dance seemed to think that mighty honour was about to be conferred upon but my own part i would have given much to forego the distinction however there was help it so i submitted quietly to having my hair dressed and to being inducted into my best frock i was dreadfully abashed when the footman threw open the door and announced in loud voice miss janet hope dinner had just been served and her ladyship was waiting i advanced up the room and made my curtsey lady chillington looked at grimly without relaxing muscle and then extended lean foreﬁnger which i pressed respectfully the butler indicated chair and i sat down next moment sister agnes glided in through side door and took her place at the table but considerably apart from lady chillington and i felt inﬁnitely relieved by her presence her ladyship looked elaborately youthful with her pink cheeks her black wig and her large white teeth on the evening of my arrival at deepley walls but her hand s shook little making the diamonds on her ﬁngers scintillate in the candlelight she carried her food to her mouth and this was sign of age which not all the art in the world could obviate the table was laid out with quantity of plate indeed the plate was out of all proportion to the dinner which consisted of nothing more elaborate than some mutton broth roast pullet and custard but there was good deal of show and we were waited on assiduously by respectable but butler there was wine brought out but some old ale was poured into her ladyship glass from silver ﬂagon sister agnes had small cover laid apart from ours her dinner consisted of herbs fruit bread and water it pained to see that the look of intense melancholy which had lightened so wonderfully during our forest walk had again overshadowed her face like veil she gave one long earnest look she took her seat at the table but after that she seemed scarcely to be aware of my presence we had sat in grim silence full ﬁve minutes when lady chillington spoke can you speak french child she said turning abruptly to i can read it little but i can not speak it i replied nor understand what is said when it is spoken in your presence so much the better she answered with grating laugh children have long ears and there is freedom of conversation when they are present with that she addressed some remarks in french to sister agnes who replied to her in the same language i knew nothin g about my ears being long but her ladyship words had made them tingle if they had been boxed one pg 43 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https i was further remarks were addressed to during dinner the conversation in french became animated and i had leisure to think of other things dinner was quickly over and at signal from her ladyship the folding doors were thrown open and we deﬁled into the green saloon i bringing up the rear meekly on the table were fruit and ﬂowers and one small bottle of some light wine the butler ﬁlled her ladyship glass and then withdrew you can take pear little girl said lady chillington accordingly i took pear but when i had got it i was too timid to eat it and could nothing but hold it between my hot palms had i been at park hill seminary i should soon have made my teeth meet in the fruit but i was not certain to the proper mode of eating pears in society lady chillington placed her glass in her eye and examined critically haie haie she said that good chinfeather has not quite eradicated our gaucherie it seems we are deﬁcient in ease and aplomb what is the name of that frenchwoman agnes who lady kinbuck girls you mean madame delclos the same look out her address and remind that you write to her if mademoiselle here remain in england she will grow up weedy and will never learn to carry her shoulders properly besides the child has scarcely two words to say herself little parisian training may prove beneﬁcial at her age french girl of family would be little duchess in bearing and manners even though she had never been outside the walls of her pension how is such an anomaly to be accounted it is possible that the atmosphere may have something to with it here was fresh food wonder and such serious thought my age admitted of i was to be sent to school in france i could not make up my mind whether to be sorry or glad in truth i was neither wholly the one nor the other the tangled web of my feelings was something altogether beyond my skill to unravel lady chillington sipped her wine absently awhile sister agnes was busy with some ﬁne needlework and i was striving to elaborate giant and his attendant dwarf out of the glowing embers and cavernous recesses of the wood ﬁre while there was yet an underlying vein of thought at work in my mind which busied itself desultorily with trying to piece together all that i had ever heard or read of life in french school you can run away now little girl you are trop said her ladyship turnin g on in her abrupt fashion and you agnes may well read to couple of chap ters out of the what wonderful man was that robespierre what giant had he but lived how different the history of europe would have been from what we know it i could almost have kissed her ladyship of my own accord so pleased was i to get away i made my curtsey to her and also to sister agnes whose only reply was sweet sad smile and managed to preserve my dignity till i was out of the room but when the door was safely closed behind i ran i ﬂew along the passages till i reached the housekeeper room dance was not there neither had candles yet been lighted the bright moonlight pouring in through the window gave new idea i had not yet been down to look at the river what time could be better than the present one such purpose i had heard some of the elder girls at park hill talk of the delights of boating by moonlight boating in the present case was out of the question but there was the river itself to be seen taking my hat and scarf i let myself out by side door and then sped away across the park like hunted fawn not forgetting to take an occasional bite at her ladyship pear wonder my mind seemed purged of all those strange fears and stranger fancies engendered in it some people would say by superstition while others would hold that they were merely the effects of delicate nervous organisatio n and brain one upon the other be that it may this night they had left and i skipped on my way fearlessly though i were walking at and with glorious sense of freedom working within such only in more intense degree i had often felt on our rare holidays at school there was right of public footpath across one corner of the park tracking this narrow white ribbon through the greensward i came at length to stile which admitted into the high road pg 44 pg 45 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https opposite was second stile opening on second footpath which i felt sure could lead to nowhere but the river nor was i mistaken in another ﬁve minutes i was on the banks of the adair to my child eye the scene was one of exquisite beauty i should probably call it ﬂat and wanting in variety the equable river was lighted up by full and unclouded moon the under growth that fringed its banks was silver silver rose the mists in the meadows silence everywhere save the low liquid murmur of the river itself which seemed burdened with some love secret centuries old which it was vainly striving to tell in articulate words the burden of the beauty lay upon and saddened i wandered slowly along the bank watching the play of moonlight on the river suddenly i saw tiny boat that was moored to an overhanging willow and ﬂoated out the length of its chain towards the middle of the stream i looked around not creature of any kind was visible then i thought to myself how pleasant it would be to sit out there in the boat little while and surely one could be angry with taking such even the owner of the boat if he were to ﬁnd there sooner said than done i went down to the edge of the river and drew the boat inshore by the chain that held it then i stepped gingerly in at my own temerity and sat down the boat glided slowly out again to the length of its chain and then became motionless but it was motionless only moment or two splash in the water drew my attention to the chain it had been insecurely fastened to branch of the willow my weight in the boat had caused it to become detached and fall into the water and with horriﬁed eyes i saw that i had now means of getting back to the shore next mom ent the strength of the current carried the boat out into and i began to ﬂoat slowly down the river i sat like one paralysed unable either to stir or speak the willows seemed to bow their heads in mocking farewell i glided past them i heard the faint baying of dog on some distant farm and it sounded like in my frightened ears suddenly the spell that had held was loosened and i started to my feet the boat heeled over and but sudden instinctive movement backward i should have gone headlong into the river and have ended my troubles there and then the boat righted itself veered and then went steadily on its way down the stream i sank on my knees and buried my face in my hands and began to cry when i had cried little while it came into my mind that i would say my prayers so i said them with clasped hands and wet eyes and the words seemed to come from and affect in way that i had never experienced before i write these lines i have vivid recollection of noticing how blurred and lar ge the moon looked through my tears my heart was now quieted little i was longer so utterly overmastered by my fears i was recalled to more vivid sense of earth and its realities by the low melancholy striking of some village clock i gazed eagerly along both banks of the river but although the moon shone so brightly neither house nor church nor any sign of human habitation was visible when the clock had told its last syllable the silence seemed even more profound than before i might have been ﬂoating on river that wound through country never trodden by the foot of man so entirely alone so utterly removed from all human aid did i feel myself to be i drew the skirt of my frock over my shoulders the night air was beginning to chill and contrived to regain the seat i had taken on ﬁrst entering the boat whither would the river carry was the question i now put to myself to the sea doubtless had i not been taught at school that sooner or later all rivers emptied themselves into the ocean the immensity of the thought appalled it seemed to chill the beati ng of my heart i grew cold from head to foot still the boat held its course steadily swept onward by the resistless current still the willows nodded their fantastic farewells along the level meadows far and wide the white mist lay like vast now and then through the stillness i heard or seemed to hear mournful wail of some spirit just released from earthly bonds and forced to leave its dear ones behind the moonlight looked cruel and the water very very cold someone had told that death by drowning was swift and painless those stars up there were millions of miles away how long would it take my soul i wondered to travel that reach those glowing leave them behind how glorious such journey beyon d all power of thought to track one way among the

ﬁne degrees louder and more conﬁrmed and resolving itself at last into sound which could not be mistaken that of anything but falling water the sound was clearly in front of i was being swept resistlessly towards it curve of the river and swelling of the banks hid everything from the sound was momently growing louder and had distinctly resolved itself into the roar and rush of some great body of water i shuddered and grasped the sides of the boat with both hands suddenly the curve was rounded and there almost in front of was mass of buildings and there too spanning the river was what looked to like bridge and on the bridge was human ﬁgure the roar and noise of the cataract were deafening but louder than all was my piercing cry help he who stood on the bridge heard it i saw him ﬂing up his hands if in sudden horror and that was the last thing i did see i sank down with closed eyes in the bottom of the boat and my heart went up in silent cry to heaven next moment i was swept into scarsdale weir the boat seemed to glide from under my head struck something hard the water overwhelmed seized on dashed here and there in its merciless arms noise of thousand cataracts ﬁlled my ears moment and then i recollect nothing more to be continued sonnet wouldst thou be happy friend get get thou art the very torment of human heart ah yes i thought i still am young and let my heart

delightful to steam into the harbour of malo if the sea has been rough and unkindly you at once pass from purgatory to paradise with relief those will understand who have experienced it the scene is very charming the coast broken and undulating is rich and fertile very often hazy and dreamy the landscape is veiled by purple mist which reminds one very much of the irish lakes and mountains across the water lies dinard with its lovely views its hilly thoroughfares its english colony and its french patois but the boat turning the point steams up the harbour and dinard falls away malo lies ahead on the left enclosed in its ancient grey walls which encircle it like belt and on the right farther away rise the towers and steeples of servan also of ancient celebrity on the particular morning of which i write we steamed up the harbour towards our moorings the quays looked gay and lively the town very picturesque it is so in truth though some of its picturesqueness is the result of antiquity dirt and dilapidation but the fresh green trees lining the quay looked bright and youthful contrast with the ancient grey walls that formed their background vessels were loading and unloading people hurried to and fro many had evidently come down to see the boat in and not few were unmistakably english here and there in the grey walls were the grand imposing gateways of the town above the walls rose the quaint houses roof above roof gable beside gable tier beyond tier at the end of the quay the old castle brought the scene to ﬁne conclusion it was built by anne of brittany and dates from the sixteenth century one of its towers bears the singular motto or inscription qui grogne ainsi sera mon plaisir which seems to suggest that the illustrious lady owned determined will and purpose it is

france these bretons of low order of development physically and mentally they yet have stubborn will which carries them through impossible hardships they may be conquered but they never yield the walk round the town upon the walls is extremely interesting gradually making way the scene changes like the shifting slides of panorama now the harbour lies before you with its busy quays its docks its small crowd of shipping very crowded we have never seen it the old castle rises majestically looking all its three centuries of age and royal dignity its four towers unspoilt by restoration pg 49 the

the franklin and found it veritable barmecide feast from which we got up far more hungry than we had sat down display so mean that we soon ceased to wonder that only two others graced the board with ourselves and they though frenchmen strangers to the place the hôtel france was very different from this if it left something to be desired in the way of reﬁnement it erred on the side of abundance therefore on landing this morning we gave our lighter baggage in charge of the porter of the hotel who knew us well and according to his wont gave us friendly greeting monsieur visite encore malo said he et nous apporte le beau temps soyez le bienvenu this was not in the least frenchman pg 50 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https m alo we went on to the and we had nothing

forms part of the building in which chateaubriand lived we had very short time to devote to malo long journey still lay before us we wished to reach morlaix that night there was the choice of taking the train direct or of crossing by boat to dinard and so joining the train from malo which reached dinan after long round the latter seemed preferable since it promised more variety though shortening our stay at the old town but madame wisely remarked it would give us sufﬁcient time luncheon and an extra hour or so in malo could not be very proﬁtably spent so before long we were once more going

and the sunshine had been made them alone and it was their duty to enjoy it to the utmost it was impossible to sketch them time and tide wait man and even now the whistle of the dinard boat might be heard shrieking its impatient warning round the corner but we took the old women with an instantaneous camera and with wonderful result it was all over before they had time to pose and put on expressions and when they found they had been photographed they thought it the great event of their lives the mere fact is sufﬁcient with these good folk possession of the likeness is very secondary consideration we left them crooning and laughing and casting admiring glances after at eighty years of age possibly with sigh to their lost youth then we turned where the walls bend round and came in sight of the boat steaming alongside the small stone and preparing departure the passengers were not numerous few men and women the latter with white caps and large baskets who had evidently been over to malo household purposes and were returning with the resigned is very country women are so fond of wearing when they have been spending money and lessening the weight of the stocking which contains their treasured hoard we mounted the bridge which being and an extra two or three sous was deserted these thrifty people would soon think of burning down their cottages of wasting two sous in useless honour to them the principle but we surveying human nature from an elevation felt privileged to philosophise and if this human nature was interesting what about the natural world around us the boat loosed its moorings when time was up and the grey walls of malo receded the innumerable roofs towers and steeples grew dreamy and indistinct dissolved and disappeared the water was still blue and calm and ﬂashing with sunlight to the right lay the sleeping ocean ahead of us dinard land rose on all sides bays and creeks ran upwards out of sight headlands rich in verdure magniﬁcently wooded houses standing out here lonely and solitary there clustering almost into towns and villages the mouth of the rance leading up to dol and dinan which some have called the rhine of france and everyone must think stream lovely and romantic most beautiful of all seemed dinard which we rapidly approached in twenty minutes we had passed into the little harbour beyond the pier it was quite bustling quay with carriages hire and men with barrows touting noisily custom treading upon each other heels in the race existence cafés and small hotels in the background having plenty of time we preferred to walk to the station and consigned our baggage to the care of deaf and dumb man who disappeared with everything like magic left us high and dry upon the quay to follow more leisurely and to hope that we were not the victims of misplaced conﬁdence it looked very much like it steep climb brought us to the heights of dinard nothing could be more romantic here were traces of antiquity everything was aggressively modern all beauty lay in scenery and situation humble cottages embowered in roses and wisteria stately châteaux standing in large luxuriant gardens ﬂaming with ﬂowers proudly secluded behind great iron gates at every opening the sea far down lay stretched before us precipitous cliffs rugged rocks where ﬂowers and verdure grew in wild profusion led sheer to the water edge land everywhere rose in dreamy atmosphere malo and servan across the bay in the distance it was wealth of vegetation trees in full foliage masses of gorgeous ﬂowers that you had only to stretch out your hand and gather the blue sky over all scene we sometimes realise in our dreams rarely in our waking we saw it that day on the water below small boats looked shadowy and dreamy the far ﬂeecy clouds above but we could not linger we passed away from the town and the sea and found ourselves in the station seemed to escape us like presently we came to where two roads of them led to the station cottage we should probably have taken the wrong does not on these occasions happily priest came in sight with stately step and slow reading his breviary of him we asked the way and he very politely set us right in french that was refreshing after the patois around was evidently cultivated man and of fered to escort us pg 53 pg 54 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https this was unnecessary we thanked him and departed and arriving soon after at the station found our deaf and dumb porter had not played us false he was cunning enough to ask us three times his proper fare and when we gave him half his demand seemed surprised at so much liberality conversation had to be carried on with paper and pencil and by signs and tokens the train started after great ﬂourish of trumpets we had journey of many hours before us through north brittany brittany is hundred years behind the rest of france and however slow the trains may be in fair normandy they are still slower in the breton provinces in due time we reached dinan when we joined the train that had come round from malo nothing in brittany is more lovely and striking than the situation of dinan it overlooks the rance and from the train we looked down into an immense valley everywhere the eye rested upon profusion of wild uncultivated verdure the granite cliffs were steep and wooded far in the depth s the sacred river ran few boats and barges sailing up and down passed under the lovely viaduct brittany peasant girls were putting off from the shallow bank with small cargoes of provisions evidently coming from some market under the rugged cliffs ran long row of small unpretending houses level with the river paradise sheltered one would think from all the winds of heaven yet even here doub t the east wind ﬁnds passage its sharp tooth to warp the waters m alo further on one caught sight of an old church evidently in the hands of the philistines under process of restoration and an ancient monastery the town crowned the cliffs but very little could be seen beyond churches and steeples we left it to future time the train went through beautiful and undulating country until it reached lamballe picturesquely placed on the slope of hill watered by small stream and crowned by the ancient and romantic ruins of the castle which belonged to the counts of penthièvre and was dismantled by cardinal richelieu ﬁne gothic building of which we easily traced the outlines the present church of notre dame was formerly the chapel of the castle here we longed to explore but it did not enter into our plans so also the interesting town of guingamp had to be passed over the present we were impatient to see morlaix having heard much of its picturesqueness and antiquity we hoped great things yet our experiences began in an adventurous and not very agreeable manner darkness had fallen when we reached the old town after long and tedious journey nothing is so tiring slow train which crawls upon the road and lingers at every station of morlaix we pg 55 pg 56 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https see nothing we felt ourselves rumbling over viaduct which seemed to reach the clouds and far down we saw the lights of the town shining like stars so that with the stars above we seemed to be placed between two ﬁrmaments but that was all everything was wrapped in gloom and mystery the train steamed into the station and its few lights only rendered darkness yet more visible the passengers stumbled across the line in small ﬂock to the point of exit we had been strongly recommended to the hôtel strongly cautioned against any other but we found that the omnibus was not at the station nor any ﬂys nothing but the omnibus of small hotel we had never heard of in charge of conductor rough uncivil and less than half sober this was also the drive to take us to any other hotel than his own would listen to argument or reason had he been civil we might have accepted the situation but it seemed evident that an inn employing such man was to be avoided unwilling to be beaten we sought the and his advice why is the omnibus of the hôtel not here we asked doubt the hotel is full it is the moment of the great fair you know but we did not know we knew of leipzig fair by sad experience of bartholomew fair by tradition of the fair of novgorod by hearsay but of morlaix fair we had never heard what is the fair we asked with sinking heart the great horse fair replied the surely you have heard of it one ever visits morlaix at the time of the fair unless he comes to buy or sell horses having come neither to buy nor sell horses we felt crushed and hoped the deluge i proposed to the train and let it take us whither it mattered not calmly suggested suicide what is to be done he groaned the man refuses to take us to the hôtel he is not sober it is useless to ar gue with him the fair again laughed the ofﬁcial it is responsible everything just now and bretons are not the most sober people at the best of times still if you wish to go to the hôtel the man must take you there is other conveyance and he is bound to so but i warn you that it will be full or the omnibus would have been here turning to the man he threatened to report him gave him his orders and said he should inquire on the morrow how they had been carried out we struggled into the omnibus which was already fairly packed with men who looked very much like horsedealers the surly driver slammed the door and the politely bowed us away the curtain dropped upon act comedy or tragedy the event might prove it soon threatened to be tragedy the omnibus tore down steep hill if the horses well the driver had been indulging swayed from side to side and seemed every moment about to overturn now the passengers were all thrown to the right of the vehicle now to the left and now they all collided in the centre the enraged driver was having his revenge upon us and we repented our boldness in trusting our lives in his hands but the sturdy bretons accepted the situation so calmly that we felt there must still be chance of escape so it proved in due time it drew up at the hôtel with the noise of an artillery waggon and out came hellard the landlord his appearance with his white hair and benevolent face was sufﬁcient to recommend him to begin with we felt we had done wisely and made known our wants i am very sorry he replied but gentl emen i am quite full there is not vacant room in the hotel from roof to basement put us anywhere we persisted it would never to be beaten at last the couple of cupboards anything but send us away the landlord looked puzzled he had tall ﬁne presence and handsome face not in the least like frenchman i assure you that i have neither hole nor corner nor cupboard at your pg 57 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https he declared i have sent away dozen people in the last hour who arrived by the last train why did you not send word you were coming we are only two not dozen we urged and we knew nothing of this terrible fair or we should not have come at all but we are here here we must remain with that we left the omnibus and went into the hall enjoying the landlord perplexed attitude but when did case of this sort ever fail to yield to persuasion the last resource has very seldom been reached however much we may think it and an emer gency begets its own remedy the remedy in this instance was the landlady out she came at the moment from her bureau all gestures and possibilities we felt saved mon cher she to but to her send the gentlemen away at this time of night and consign them to you know not what fate something can be managed tenez with uplifted hands and an inspiration ma bouchère mon cher ma bouchère voice exclamation gesture general inspiration the whole essence would evaporate if translated ma bouchère has two charming rooms that she will be delighted to give it is only cat jump from here she added turning to us you will be perfectly comfortable and can take your meals in the hotel i shall have rooms you so the luggage was brought down the landlord went through passage at arms with the driver who demanded double fare and ﬁnally went off with nothing but promise of punishment we had triumphed and thought our troubles were over they had only begun our remaining earthly desire was strong tea followed by repose we had had very little sleep the previous night on board the boat and the day had been long and tiring the tea immediately but you will have to wait little the rooms said madame my bouchère is at the theatre we must all have little distraction sometime s it will be over short quarter of an hour and then i will send to her madame was evidently woman of capacity the short quarter of an hour might be proﬁtably spent in consuming the tea after delicious prospect of rest which we longed the peri longed paradise meanwhile perhaps messieurs will walk into the café of the hotel awaiting their rooms said the landlord where tea shall be served concluded madame giving directions to waiter who stood by perfect image of misery his face tied up after the fashion of the french nation suffering from toothache and ﬂuxion but the ﬁre is out in the kitchen objected misery in the spirit of pierrot friend then let it be commanded madame at such times these the ﬁre has not

smoke worse than the worst of english tobacco the room was crowded the noise pandemonium card playing occupied some tables dominoes others the company was very much what might be expected at horse

existence our hope was in madame pg 58 pg 59 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https we waited in patience the short quarter of an hour developed into long when tea arrived small cups small tea pot usual strainer infusion still it just saved our reason felt that he should never write another line of poetry the tobacco fumes had taken an opium effect upon and i began to see visions and imagined ourselves in dante inferno we looked with mild reproach at the waiter he quite understood guilty conscience needed words and explained that the chef had let out the ﬁre the chef was at that moment in the café playing cards absorbed and excited anyone wonder that he had forgotten his ordinary duties and our rooms we asked are they ready the theatre is not yet over replied the waiter madame is on the the play is extra long in honour of the fair that miserable fair the tea revived us it always does i feel less like expiring murmured with tremulous sigh but this place is like furnace seven times heated and the noise is pandemonium in revolt what would lady maria think of this why need that frivolous butcher have gone to the theatre of all nights in the year and why need all these people have stayed away from it why is everything upside down and cross and contrary and why are we here at all was evidently on the ver ge of brain fever we waited there was nothing else it it was torture but others have been tortured before now and some have survived and some have died of it we felt that we should die of it half past eleven had come and gone midnight was about to strike oh that we had gone on with that wretched omnibus matter what the end yes it had come to that pg 60 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https last human nature could bear it longer we appealed to the landlord he looked up from his game ﬂushed startled and repentant what have they not taken you to the bouchère he exclaimed why the theatre was over long ago and doubt everything is arranged you shall be conducted at once misery looking himself more dead than alive he informed us presently in an access of conﬁdence that he had had four teeth taken out that day and felt none the better it was told off to act guide and shouldering such baggage we needed the night stepped forth we pitied him he seemed so completely at the end of all things and feeling by comparison that there was deeper depth of suffering than our own we revived his name was not misery but andré monsieur accompanied us to the door and wished us madame had disappeared and was nowhere to be found the lights were out in her bureau it looked very much if she too had gone to bed and forgotten us cette chère dame is tired said the sympathetic landlord we really have rest day or night at the time of the fair but you may depend upon it she has made it all right with her bouchère so we departed in faith it was impossible to be angry with monsieur though we felt neglected he was so unlike the ordinary run of landlords that one could only repose conﬁdence in him and overlook small inattentions he had way of throwing himself into your interests and making them his own the time being but i fear that his memory was very short we departed with thanksgiving and followed our guide i can not say that we trod in his footsteps too far gone to lift his feet bravely he merely shufﬂed along the pavement with one hand he supported the luggage on his shoulder with the other he carried candle ostensibly to light our pathway in reality only complicating matters and the darkness we turned round by the hotel the clocks struck the witching hour shivered and looked about ghosts it was really very ghostly scene and atmosphere in spite of the occasion of the fair the town was in repose the theatre was long over the extra entertainment on account of the fair had been mere invention of the imaginative waiter people had very properly gone home to bed and lights were out noisy groups were abroad making night hideous with untimely revelry we formed strange procession our little guide slipped and shufﬂed hardly able to put one foot before the other he wore of list or wool and made scarcely any noise he went along every now and then he groaned in the agonies of toothache and each time shivered and looked back the ghost it was excusable the candle threw weird shadows around which ﬂitted about like phantoms playing at the night was so calm that the ﬂame scarcely ﬂickered in spite of the darkness we could see how picturesque was the old town and we longed daylight against the dark background of sky the yet darker outlines of the houses stood out mysteriously we turned into narrow street where opposite neighbours might almost have shaken hands with each other from the upper windows wonderful gabled roofs succeeded each other in long procession there seemed not vestige of anything modern in the whole thoroughfare we were in scene of the middle ages back in those far days here and there light shining in room revealed large latticed window running the whole width of the house in spite of andré fatigue and burden we could only stand and gaze human power could mesmerise us but the window did so what could be more startlingly weird and picturesque than the bright reﬂection of these latticed panes surrounded by this intense darkn ess these mysterious outlines almost we expected to see ghostly vision advance from the interior and opening the lattice with skeleton hand ask our pleasure at thus invading their solitude at the witching the vibration of the bells tolling midnight was still upon the air travelling into space perhaps announcing to other worlds that to us another day was dead another day was born but ghost appeared very human ﬁgure however did so it looked down upon us moment and mistaking our rapt gaze at the which it did not form mere vulgar curiosity held up reproving hand then catching sight of it darted forward looked breathlessly

natural sequence ghostly shadows ﬂitted out of every doorway down every turning at last we emer ged on to an open space partly ﬁlled by modern building with hideous roof evidently the market place here we ascended to higher level ancient outlines still surrounded us but were interrupted by modern ones also square roofs and straight lines broke the continuity of the picturesque gabled roofs and latticed windows ichabod may be written upon the lintels of all that is ancient and disappearing all that is modern and hideous the spirit and beauty of the past are dead and buried we are almost there said andré with sigh that would have been profound if he had had strength to make it so few more yards and we arrive we too sighed with relief though the midnight walk amidst these wonders of bygone age had proved refreshing and awakening but we sympathised with our guide who was only kept up by necessity we passed out of the market place again into narrow street dark silent and gloomy at

ought to be at this hour of the night but la patrone sent to engage rooms these gentlemen and you promised to give them they have come open the door we can not stay here till daybreak you will stay there till doomsday if it depends on my opening to you la patrone never sent and i never promised i have only one small empty bed in my house and in the other bed in the same room two of my boys are sleeping i am very sorry the gentlemen my compliments to la patrone and before sending gentlemen to at midnight she ought to ﬁnd out if i can accommodate them to you and let us have more rioting and the nightcapped head was withdrawn the lattice was sharply closed and we were left to make the best of the situation it was serious nearly one in the morning the whole town slumbering and we homeless ragged and tanned to remain was useless not all the ringing and rowing in the world would bring forth madame again though it might possibly produce her avenging spouse andré shouldered his baggage and we began to retrace our steps back to the hotel commanded they must put us up somewhere not hole or corner unoccupied groaned andré you ca sleep in the bread oven and they will all have gone to bed by the time we get back again suddenly he halted before house at the corner of the marketplace it looked little better than common cabaret and was also closed and dark down went the luggage he knocked mysteriously at the shutters what are you doing we said you suppose that we would put up here even an hour it is clean and respectable objected andré messieurs can not walk the streets till morning door was mysteriously opened leading into room couple of candles were burning at table round which some men were seated drinking and playing cards but keeping silence it looked suspicious and uninviting in fact we might be murdered here shuddered most certainly we should be robbed andré made his request could they give us lodgment not so much chair or bench answered the woman to our relief though we should never have entered andré might have disappeared with the baggage and given us some trouble he evidently had all the obstinacy of the breton about him and was growing desperate the door was closed again without ceremony and once more we were left to make the best of it this time we took the lead and made the hotel again we passed through the wonderful street with the overhanging eaves and gables again we paused and lingered lost in admiration but the light had departed from the latticed window and doubt in dreams the fair one was beholding again the vision of few minutes more and we stood before the hotel they were just closing the doors monsieur hellard was crossing the passage at the moment never shall i forget his consternation he raised his hands and his hair stood on end what the matter he cried matter enough replied andré taking up the parable madame never sent to the bouchère and the bouchère has room and i think giving him it was too bad to give us wild goose chase at this time of night pg 65 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https and now you must your best and put us where you can i concluded we are too tired to stir another step i have where to lodge cat return ed the perplexed landlord i can not impossibilities what on earth are we to manufacture you have salon comme juste is it occupied but there are beds there it stands to reason then put down two mattresses on the ﬂoor and we will make the best of them and the sooner you allow us to repose our weary heads the more grateful we shall be it is nearly one monsieur seemed convinced and gave the word of command which sent two or three waiters ﬂying poor andré was one of them but we soon discovered that he was the most willing and obliging man in the world even now everything was mismanaged and had to be done over again wordy war ensued between landlord waiters and chambermaids each one having an original idea our comfort and wanting their own way the small bedlam that went on would have been diverting at any other time it was very nearly two before we closed the door upon the world and felt that something like peace and repose lay before us the room was not uncomfortable it had all the stiff luxuriance of french salon and gilt clock on the mantelpiece ticked loudly and rang out the many of which alas we heard on the table were the remains of dessert evidently hastily brought in from the table room which communicated with this by folding doors dishes of biscuits raisins and luscious grapes at least we can refresh ourselves sighed taking up ﬁne bunch and offering another nectar in its primitive state the drink of the gods and of poets i added talk not of poetry he cried i feel that my vein has evaporated and after will never return very soon you may be sure the room was in darkness and repose the inequalities of the earth surface are nothing to my bed groaned he laid himself down it is all hills and valleys i think they must have put the mattress upon all the brooms and brushes of the hotel crossed by all the and that wretched clock ticks on my brain like i shall not be alive by morning have you made your will yes he replied and left you my museum my all my unpublished mss and the care of my æsthetic aunt lady maria you will not ﬁnd her troublesome she lives on crystallised violets and barley water mixed blessings i thought but was too polite to say so it must have been my last thought i remembered more until the clock awoke striking four and woke again striking six after which sleep ﬁnally ﬂed soon the town also awoke doors slammed and echoed omnibuses and other vehicles rattled over the stones voices seemed to ﬁll the air the streets echoed with engers the sun was shining gloriously and we threw open the windows to the

known in the north of england the wind was howling and roaring with delight at its resistless power the rain came hissing down in lar ge drops on yonder headland doubtless might be heard the whistling woman harbinger of death and disaster to the mariner the gale had been hourly increasing in violence till the last hour before arriving at our destination we had momentarily expected that the train would be blown from the track our hotel was situated on an eminence overlooking the town and we slowly ascended to it in our cab we thought well we must not be surpri sed to ﬁnd our intended abode the night has vanished however presently we stopped in front of building which looked substantial enough to withstand anything and in answer to our driver application to the bell the door was promptly opened by porter he was closely followed by person full of smiles and bows who posted himself in the doorway ready to receive us all at once there was terriﬁc bang though had been ﬁred to welcome our arrival and he of the smiles and bows was hurled headlong against the muddy wheel of our conveyance by the of the large door my wife bonnet blew off and tugged hard at its moorings the light in the porch was extinguished while the wind seemed to give shriek of triumph at the jokes he was playing upon us here we were then in total darkness and exposed to the drenching rain however afterwards all our discomforts were forgotten we sat down to an excellent dinner la carte next morning i was abroad very early looking lodgings fortune seemed to smile upon on this occasion scarcely had i proceeded ﬁfty yards from my hotel when i came upon very row of houses and in the window of the ﬁrst was lodgings to let knocking at the door it was soon opened by very maid i inquired if i could see the proprietor but was told that miss was not yet down i said i would wait and was shown into very soon miss appeared and proved to be pretty brunette of about whose dark eyes during our short interview were every now and then ﬁxed on with an intentness that seemed to be trying to read what kind of person i was whilst her manner though decidedly pleasing had certain restlessness in it which i could not help observing her father and mother being both dead she kept the herse lf i asked her if she had good cook to which she replied that she was responsible most of that difﬁcult part of the ménage herself keeping two maids to assist in the house and parlour work she went on to say that her was dissected term common amongst north country keepers and meant to express that it was under going its autumn cleaning but she would have it put straight if i wished i told her that we should be quite contented with the provided we had good this she at once showed and soon coming to terms i returned to the hotel after breakfast i went to the bureau to ask my account whilst it was being made out i observed casually that i had taken lodgings at miss on cliff terrace upon which the accountant looked quickly up and said oh miss and then quickly went on with my bill i hardly noticed this at the moment though i thought of it afterwards eleven saw us comfortably ensconced in our rooms after lunch we took delightful expedition the weather having greatly moderated we found that night at dinner that miss was cook and we retired to rest much pleased with our quarters we soon made the acquaintance of the two maids jane who waited upon us and mary the housemaid and two very pleasant and obliging young women we found them pg 69 pg 70 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https the third morning of our stay on going up to my after breakfast i was surprised to ﬁnd strange maid in the room she was standing by the bed smoothing down the with both hands and appeared to take notice of but continued gazing steadily in front of her while her hands went mechanically on smoothing the clothes i could not help being struck with her pale face which wore look of pain and the ﬁxed and almost stony expression of her eyes i left her in exactly the same position i found her on coming down i said to my wife i did not know miss employed three servants there certainly is another making the bed in our room i am and my wife would have it i had made mistake but i felt quite certain i had not later on whilst jane was laying the lunch i said to her i thought that you and mary were the only two servants in the house yes sir only and mary was jane reply she left the room there said my wife i told you that you were mistaken and i did not pursue the subject further two or three days slipped away in pleasant occupations such driving boating and we had forgotten all about the third maid we saw but little of miss though her handiwork was pleasantly apparent in the cuisine on the sixth morning of our stay which was the day before we were to leave my wife after breakfast said she would go up and little packing whilst i made out our route the following day in the bradshaw but was soon interrupted by the return of my wife with rather scared look on her face well she said you were right after all there is another maid and she is now in our room and apparently engaged in much the same occupation when you saw her there she took notice of but stood there with her body slightly bent over the bed looking straight in front of her her hands smoothing the she described her having dark hair her face very pale and her mouth very ﬁrmly set my curiosity was now so much awakened that i determined to question miss on the subject but our carriage was now at the door waiting us to start on an expedition that would engage us all day on my return late in the afternoon meeting miss in the passage i said to her who is the third servant that and myself have seen once or twice in our miss looked i thought rather scared and murmuring something that i could not catch turned and went hurriedly down the stairs into the kitchen an hour afterwards we were sitting waiting our dinner jane brought note from miss enclosing her account and saying that she had just had telegram summoning her to the bed of relation that in all probability she would not be back till after our departure but that she had left directions with the servants and hoped they would make us quite comfortable and that we would excuse her hurried departure few minutes after cab drove up to the door into which from our window we saw miss get and drive rapidly away later on in the evening whilst jane was clearing away the dinner things i said to her by jane who is the third maid she was just going to leave the room i spoke instead of replying she turned round with such scared look on her face that i felt quite alarmed then hurriedly catching up her tray she left the room thinking that further inquiry would be very disagreeable to her i forbore again mentioning the subject next day our week being up we departed fresh woods and pastures new our tour led us considerably further north but month later saw us homeward bound the nearest route by rail led us by we drew up at the station we noticed on the platform parson in whom we recognised one of the clergy of whose church we had been to presently the door of our compartment was opened and he put in lady wished her the guard whistle blew and we were off after short time we fell into conversation with the lady and found her to be the cler gyman wife amongst other things we asked after miss pg 71 pg 72 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https oh miss she replied she is very well but i hear poor thing she has not had very good season i am sorry to hear that i replied why is it she was silent minute and then related to us the following facts at the beginning of the season rather untoward event occurred at miss lodgings an elderly lady took one of the ﬂats month she had with her an attendant of about thirty before long miss observed that they were not on very good terms and one morning the old lady was found dead in her bed doctor was at once called in who on viewing the body found there were very suspicious marks round the neck and throat if person ﬁngers had been tightly pressed upon them the maid on hearing this at once became very restless and going to her which was at the top of the house packed small bag and having put on her things was about to descend the stairs when from hurry or agitation she missed her footing and falling to the bottom broke her neck but not the least extraordinary part of the business was that not the slightest clue could be obtained to who the lady was the linen of herself and her maid having only initials marked on it the police did their best by advertising and inquiry but all they could ﬁnd out was that they had come straight to from liver pool where they had arrived from america there they were traced to fifth avenue hotel in new york where they had been only known by the number of their room and to which they had come from one knew whither enough money was found in the lady box to pay the expenses of their funerals an open verdict was returned at the inquests which were held the police took possession of their belongings and had them doubt at the present moment at this point the train stopped the lady wished us and left the carriage and we we steamed south were left to meditate on this strange but perfectly true story and to solve we best could the still unanswered question of who was the third maid modern witch never shall i forget my ﬁrst meeting with irene latouche after travelling all day i had arrived at my friend maitland house to ﬁnd that dinner had been over at least an hour having taken the precaution of dining during the journey this did not affect very materially but my kindly host who met in the hall took it very much to heart we quite gave you up my dear fellow we did indeed he reiterated grasping my hand with additional fervour each time he made the assertion my wife will be so vexed at your missing dinner you are sure you wo have bit now such haunch of venison hung to turn one of old ward you know he has taken glen bogie this season and is having rare sport i am told ah well if you really wo take anything we had better join the ladies in the room but the luggage has come from the station yet i interposed and my dress clothes are in my nonsense about dress clothes it will be soon you suppose anybody cares what you have on you with this comforting assurance maitland pushed open the door and ﬂood of light streamed out into the hall dazzled by the sudden glare i stepped back but not before i had caught sight of most striking ﬁgure at the further end of the long room who on earth is that girl i whispered which oh the one playing the harp you mean i might have known that rare beauty is she i thought you would ﬁnd her out pretty soon pg 73 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https i am bachelor of quiet tastes and nothing annoys more than when my friends poke ponderous fun at in this fashion so ignoring maitland facetious suggestion i calmly walked forward and shook hands with my hostess she greeted with her customary cordiality and in about two minutes i was feeling perfectly at home in spite of my dusty clothes i now had an opportunity of examining the other guests who were dispersed in groups about the room most of them were people i had frequently met before under the maitlands hospitable roof but the face which had ﬁrst arrested my attention was that of an absolute stranger i see you are admiring miss latouche like the rest of us said maitland in low voice such talented girl she can play positively any kind of instrument and has persuaded to have the old harp taken out of the lumber and put in order her she looks so well playing it does she quite like cleopatra or the queen of sheba she is undoubtedly handsome in certain style i replied cautiously i know whether i admire such gipsy type ah you agree with then interrupted my hostess eagerly i call it an uncomfortable sort of beauty she always looks if she might produce dagger at moment notice the people in operas give nice simple girl with pretty english face like my niece lily wallace over there but i am bound to say miss latouche makes great sensation wherever she goes of course she has wonderful powers i was about to inquire in what these powers consisted when maitland was called away left to myself i could not repress smile at the comparison she had instituted between her own niece and the beautiful stranger lily was well enough pink and white girl who in twenty years time would develop into just such another ﬂorid matron her aunt and then i looked again at miss latouche she was seated little apart from the rest one white arm hanging listlessly over the harp upon which she had just been playing her large dark eyes had look of utter abstraction from all matters that i have never seen in anyone besides masses of wavy black hair were loosely coiled over her head round high spanish comb and half conceal ed her brow in dusky cloud at ﬁrst sight the black velvet dress which swept around her in heavy folds seemed rather an unsuitable costume so young girl but its sombreness was relieved by gorgeous indian scarf thrown carelessly over the shoulders i not know who was responsible miss latouche or if she really required an extra wrap at any rate the combination of colours was very ef fective whilst i was speculating vaguely on the probable character of this striking young lady she slowly rose from her low seat and crossed the room her eyes were wide open but apparently ﬁxed on space and she moved with the slow mechanical motion of sleepwalker to my intense surprise she came straight towards and stood in an expectant attitude about yard from where i was sitting not knowing exactly how to receive this advance i jumped up and offered her my chair she waved it aside with gesture of imperial scorn her dark eyes positively ﬂashed ﬁre and rich glow ﬂushed her pale olive cheek i could see that i had deeply offended her i must apologise i began nervously but i thought you might be tired before the words were fairly spoken i realised the full imbecility of this remark my only excuse making such fatuous observation was that the near vicinity of this weird beauty had paralysed my reasoning faculties so that i hardly knew what i was saying and then she spoke in low rich voice which thrilled through every nerve i could not understand the meaning of her words or even recognise the language in which they were spoken but the tone of her voice was unutterably sad like an inarticulate wail of despair all the time her glorious eyes were resting on if she would read my inmost thoughts whilst i responded with an idiotic smile of embarrassment even now after the lapse of years it makes hot all over to think of that moment i know how long i had been standing looking like fool when miss latouche turned away abruptly she had approached and walked straight to the door with sigh of relief i sank down on the despised chair after few moments i gained sufﬁcient courage to glance round and assure myself that spectators had witnessed my discomﬁture it was great relief to ﬁnd that the entire party had migrated to the further end of the room where funny little man pg 74 pg 75 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https singing comic songs with banjo accompaniment i slipped in next my host who was thoroughly enjoying the performance encore capital give us some more of it tommy he roared when the song came to an end that my sort of music is it yours carew he added turning to very clever performance i answered stifﬂy divided between my natural abhorrence of comic songs and the difﬁculty of making candid reply in the immediate vicinity of the funny man just so that what i call really clever said maitland not perceiving my lack of enthusiasm worth dozen of those melancholy tunes on the harp in my opinion what become of miss latouche could stand this sort of thing i suppose too merry her what pity such handsome girl should mope so miss latouche appears to be rather eccentric i interposed something of genius i imagine so they all say well she is clever girl you will soon ﬁnd out what she is like here tommy going to give us that capital song about the bad cigar ever heard it ha ha it will make you laugh then that is just what i hate about comic performance one laughs under compulsion if one is sufﬁciently independent to resist one incurs the suspicion of being wanting in humour and some friend feels bound to explain the joke until one forces little hollow mirth directly the song was in full swing and the audience convulsed with merriment i seized my opportunity and ﬂed from the in the library i knew by experience that i should ﬁnd good ﬁre and comfortable both of which would be acceptable after my long journey it was separated from the rest of the house by heavy baize door and long passage so that i was not likely to be disturbed by any stray revellers several years experience of the comforts of bachelor establishment has given great taste my own society and it was with unfeigned delight that i looked forward to quiet in this haven of refuge bother maitland why does he have the house better warmed and lighted i muttered the baize door swung behind and the sudden draught extinguished my candle i would not go back to relight it fear of encountering some ofﬁcious friend in the hall who would insist upon accompanying into my retreat i preferred groping my way down the long corridor which was in darkness except bright streak of moonlight that streamed in through window at the further end i had just decided that it was my plain duty to give maitland the address of good shop where he could not only procure cheap lamps but also very serviceable stoves warming passages at moderate price when i discovered that the said window was open too bad of the servants i thought i should dischar ge them all if they were mine it quite accounts the howling draught through the house just the thing to give one rheumatism at this time of year advancing with the intention of excludi ng the chilly blast i was suddenly arrested by the sight of motionless ﬁgure kneeling in front of the window it was irene latouche i had not noticed her in the confusing patch of moonlight until my foot was almost on the heavy velvet dress which fell over the ﬂoor like great dark pall her arms were resting on the her beautiful pale face gazing upwards with an expression of agonised despair evidently she was quite unconscious of my presence whilst i was turning over in my mind the possibility of beating silent retreat she gave low groan so full of unquenchable pain that my blood fairly ran cold then rising to her feet she leaned far out into the chill night air stretching her white arms up towards the stars with passionate action of entreaty oh my beloved shall i ever pray in vain is there mercy she cried and the sound of her voice was like the wind moaning through rocky caverns my heart is breaking my strength is almost at an end how much longer must i suf fer this unspeakable misery clearly this sort of thing was not intende d strangers i stopped my ears and shrank closely i could into the shadow of the wall but i could not take my eyes off the girl moment such an exhibition of wild passion i have never witnessed before or since dramatic effort pg 76 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https was superb but all the time i was distinctly conscious of the absurd ﬁgure i should cut if any third person came on the scene also certain warning twinges in my left shoulder reminded that i was not in the habit of standing by open windows on bleak autumn nights why miss latouche did not catch her death of cold i can not imagine i could see the wind disordering her dark masses of hair and blowing back the indian scarf from her bare shoulders but she appeared to be indif ferent to personal discomfort she was to all external sounds just i had settled that my health would never survive such wanton infringement of all sanitary laws irene again sank on her knees and buried her face in her hands now was my time i crept noiselessly back up the corridor until my hand was actually on the baize door then excitement got the better of prudence and tearing it open i rushed wildly across the hall and up the staircase never pausing until i was safe in my own room with the door locked behind and the unlighted candle still clutched ﬁrmly in my hand ii now having already mentioned that i am person of regular and strictly conventional habits it will be readily believed that i viewed these extraordinary proceedings with unmitigated disgust it was not to encounter horrid experiences like this that i had left my comfortable town house where draughts and midnight adventures were alike unknown before i came down to breakfast on the following morning i had fabricated long story about pressing business which necessitated my immediate return to town though ordinarily of truthful disposition i was prepared to solemnly aver that the success of an important lawsuit depended on my presence in london within the next twelve hours i did not even shrink from the prospect of having to produce circumstantial evidence to convince maitland of the truth of my assertion anything rather than under go any further shocks to my nervous system happily i was spared the necessity of perjuring myself to this extent when the breakfast bell rang i descended and found that usual very few of the guests had obeyed the summons maitland was pouring out tea quite undisturbed by this irregularity longacres is house where attendance at the meals is never compulsory and how have you slept she said extending plump hand glittering with rings we were afraid that perhaps you were little overtired last night you went off to bed in the middle of the singing capital was it tucker is so very funny and never in the least vulgar with his jokes now some comic singers really forget that there are girls in the lily my love just go and see if your uncle is coming down assure you carew i was staying in country house last i give the songs were only ﬁt it perfectly true even geor ge said it made him feel quite red to hear such things in room but i was saying tucker is so different such genuine humour you know it is impossible to conjecture how long my amiable hostess might have rippled on in this strain if our conversation had not been interrupted by the entry of miss latouche you have been introduced whispered maitland and without waiting an answer she called out merrily my dear irene you must positively come and entertain carew he will give up early rising if he ﬁnds that it is always to mean with an old woman to my intense astonishment miss latouche replied in the same jesting tone and taking the vacant seat next mine began at once to talk in the most friendly way imaginable not trace of eccentricity was perceptible in her manner she was merely handsome girl with strong vein of originality i began to doubt the evidence of my senses surely i must have been labouring under some hallucination the previous night it was almost easier to believe that i had been the dupe of portentous nightmare than that this charming girl should have enacted such strange part before the end of breakfast i was certain that i had taken very exaggera ted view of the situation it would be pity to cut short pleasant visit and risk offending some of my oldest friends on such purely fanciful grounds besides i just remembered that i had given my cook holiday and that if i went home i should be dependent on the culinary skill of charwoman this last consideration determined i settled to stay pg 77 pg 78 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https in miss latouche behaviour led to regret my decision on the contrary at the end of few days we were ﬁrm friends the better i knew her the greater became my admiration of her beauty and talents and without vanity i think i may say that she distinctly preferred to the other guests who were mostly very ordinary types of modern young men the extraordinary impressions of the ﬁrst evening had entirely faded from my mind when they were suddenly revived in all their intensity by the following incident it was wet morning and we were all lolling about the in various stages of boredom some of the more energetic members of the party had been out at dawn cub hunting and had returned wet through just we ﬁnished breakfast in time to add their little quota of grumbling to the general bulk of discontent maitland after making fruitless attempt to rally the spirits of the party gave up the effort in despair and retired to write letters in her room conversation was carried on in ﬁts and starts whilst from time to time people knocked about the billiard balls in desultory fashion without exhibiting even show of interest in the result of the game at last someone introduced the subject of instantly there was revival of interest everybody had some scrap of experience to contribute or some marvellous story to relate only miss latouche remained silent what pity none of us can tell fortunes cried lily wallace eagerly wo anybody try it such fun almost amusing turning tables and it often comes true in the most wonderful way ah it does indeed sighed tucker with countenance of preternatural gravity poor fellow i know was told that he would marry and then die well it all coming true indeed really how very shocking yes indeed poor chap he married last year and now he has nothing but death before him how awfully sad exclaimed lily sympathetically why you are smiling oh you bad man i believe you were only laughing at after all now irene will you please tell tucker fortune and show him that it is joking matter i am sure you know the way because i have seen mysterious book about palmistry in your room now there dear girl after little more pressing miss latouche acceded to the general request that she would show her skill several people pressed forward at once to have their fortunes told the men being quite eager the girls although they affected to laugh at the whole affair i watche d the exhibition with some interest surely here would be fair ﬁeld the exercise of that wonderful dramatic power which i knew miss latouche held in reserve well i was disappointed she examined the hands submitted to her notice and interpreted the lines with an amount of conscientious commonplaceness which i should never have given her credit the majority of the fortunes were composed of the conventional mixture of illnesses and love affairs which is the trade of magicians i glanced at her face not trace of enthusiasm was visible she was telling fortunes mechanically cottager knits stockings now we have all been done except carew it his turn cried lily who was enjoying the whole thing immensely he must have his fortune told you will him next wo you irene never oh why not are you tired what pity miss latouche took not the slightest notice of the chorus of protestations she merely turned away with such an air of inﬂexible determination that even the ardent lily refrained from pressing her any further my curiosity was considerably excited by ﬁnding myself an exception to the general rule was the inference to be drawn from miss latouche behaviour ﬂattering or the reverse i had chance of ﬁnding out until late in the afternoon when the rain ceased and we all gladly seized the opportunity of getting some exercise before dinner the different members of the party quickly dispersed in opposite directions few exceptionally active young people tried to make up lost time by starting game of tennis on the cinder courts some diver ged towards the stables others took brisk constitutional up and pg 79 pg 80 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https the gravel path under the pretence of lighting cigar i contrived to wait about near the door until i saw miss latouche crossing the hall i remember thinking how wonderfully handsome she looked she came forward with crimson shawl thrown over her it was one of her peculiarities never to wear conventional hat or bonnet unless absolutely obliged what you say to going up the hill on the chance of seeing ﬁne sunset i said she joined she nodded assent and turning away from the others we began to climb winding path from the top of which there was supposed to be wonderful view whe n we had gone about quarter of mile we stopped and looked round far out in front stretched beautiful valley lighted by gleams of ﬁtful sunshine the house and garden lay at our feet but so far below that we only occasionally heard faint echo from the tennis courts the moment seemed propitious miss latouche i said abruptly i want to ask you something sooner were the words spoken than it struck they were liable to be misunderstood she might imagine that i intended to make her an offer and accept on the spot inﬁnitely i admired her in an abstract fashion i had never contemplated matrimony moment visions of enraged male relatives armed with followed by formidable breach of promise case ﬂitted through my mind there was time to be lost it only about the i stammered out nothing else i assure at all i knew it replied miss latouche calmly and without trace of embarrassment sensible girl i breathed freely once more and proceeded with my investigations why would you tell my fortune this morning why am i alone excluded you really wish to know she said very quietly of course or i should ask well then the reason that i declined to tamper with your destiny is that i should be irresistibly compelled to tell you the truth are you serious or am i serious she cried with wild laugh you ask this the time has at last come an explanation i would willingly have spared you but it is in vain that we seek to avoid our fate rest here and seizing my wrist she dragged down on the fallen trunk of tree that lay half hidden by the tall grass at the side of the path immediately behind us was gloomy wood choked with rank autumnal growths more dank unwholesome situation seat on wet day it would be impossible to conceive but i preferred running the risk of rheumatic fever to contradicting miss latouche in her present mood only i hoped the explan ation would be exceedingly brief you pretend that you never saw before the other evening she began feverishly certainly i answered with great astonishment it was undoubtedly our ﬁrst meeting i am can you swear it she interrupted eagerly oh i never swear but i mind afﬁrming i said playfully hoping to give less serious turn to the conversation to my horror miss latouche wrung her hands with the same expression of hopeless suffering that i had seen once before it is too cruel she moaned after all this dreary waiting and watching to be met like this oh my beloved i can not bear it any longer shall i never ﬁnd you never never her voice died away with sob of despair which effectually quenched my capacity making jokes pg 81 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https i hardly understand what you are alluding to i said nicely i could but if you will trust i promise to anything that lies in my power to help you you promise she exclaimed eagerly mind you are bound now bound to my service this was taking my polite offer of assistance rather more seriously than i intended muttering some commonplace compliment i begged to be further enlightened you will not repeat to any living soul the mysteries i am about to disclose she began i need not ask there is already sufﬁcient sympathy between us to be sure of your discretion but remember if you ever feel tempted to disclose single word of these hidden matters there are unseen powers who will amply avenge the profanation know then that since my beloved was snatched from by what dull men call death all my faculties have been concentrated on the effort to discover some link of communication with the invisible world i will not dwell on my toils and sufferings the terrible sights i have braved and the sleepless nights that i have sacriﬁced to study i not grudge my youth passed it were under the shadow of the tomb at last the truth has been revealed to you are to be the medium oh nonsense i shouted i wo undertake it nothing shall persuade besides i am perfectly ignorant of the subject you underrate your powers observed miss latouche with calm conviction nature has endowed you with most unusual organisation your powers are quite involuntary nothing you say or can make the slightest difference you are merely passive agent the transmission of electric force you mean sort of telegraph wire i gasped feebly if you offer resistance all will be well with us continued miss latouche ignoring the interruption but the unseen powers will bear triﬂing and i can summon those to my aid who will make you bitterly repent any levity i hate those sort of vague prophecies they frighten one quite out of proportion to their real gravity by the bye i yet understand the reason you would tell my fortune you seem to know such lot about those things i said at last what you not understand yet that there is bond between us which makes any concealment impossible i could not blind you with the paltry ﬁctions that satisfy those poor fools and she waved her hand contemptuously towards the distant ﬁgures of the tennis players amongst whom tucker in wonderful costume was distinctly visible the expression struck unjustiﬁably strong even when applied to man who sang comic songs with banjo accompaniment i think he is bad little chap i said apologetically they are all alike she replied with an air of ineffable scorn you can only content them with idle promises of love and wealth like the ignorant village girl who crosses gipsy hand with silver and in return is promised rich husband and all the while i see the dark cloud hanging over them and can nothing to avert it ah it is terrible to know the evil to come and be powerless to warn others to be obliged to smile whilst one heart is wrung with anguish and one brain tortured with nameless apprehensions that is indeed misery dear i said nervously i hope you foresee any catastrophe about to overwhelm she gazed straight into my eyes and her passionate face gradually softened into lovely smile my only friend she exclaimed taking my hand gently in hers so far cloud darkens the perfect happiness of our intercourse i felt that there were moments of compensation even in the pursuit of the black arts iii pg 82 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https was curious sensation mixing again with the commonplace rs at longacres conscious that i was the repository of such extraordinary revelations before we left our damp retreat irene had conﬁded in the secret history of her life not that i understood it very clearly owing to her voice being continually choked by stiﬂed emotion but i gathered that person presumably of the male sex who was vaguely designated the beloved had perished in some frightful manner before her eyes and ever since that time she had devot ed herself to the study of the occult sciences in the ﬁrm conviction that it was possible to discov er medium of communication with the unseen world she now persisted that i had been designated by unerring proofs that medium she assured that months previously she had foreseen my arrival at longacres in the precise fashion in which it really took place every detail she said was exactly foreshadowed in the vision not only did i recognise you at once by your clothes which were different from those of the other men present but your voice seemed familiar to if i had known you years i saw you gazing at with what i fondly believed to be look of mutual recognition i remember rising from my seat in species of ecstatic trance to which i am liable in moments of excitement i have faint recollection of addressing you with an impassioned appeal help to which you responded with icy indifference but the rest of our interview remains blank only there was cruel sense of disappointment instead of meeting two spirits whose interests were inseparable you denied any previous knowledge of and even manifested sort of terriﬁed aversion at my approach i saw you shrink away from my side then nothing remained but to temporarily dissemble my purpose and try ﬁrst to win your conﬁdence by the exercise of my poor woman wits in this at least i was successful irene only spoke the truth she had completely subdued my will by her fascinations and though i hated and in private ridiculed all supernatural dealings i was prepared to try the wildest experiments at her bidding the trial of my obedience arrived sooner than i anticipated immediately after luncheon next day irene made sign to to follow her into the garden all is ready she exclaimed with great excitement will see us successful or ever lost what you mean i inquired dubiously it did not sound very cheery prospect i mean that all things point to hasty solution of the great problem t the planets are propitious and with your help the chain of communication will be at last complete oh my beloved my toil and waiting has not been all in vain well what you want to i said rather sulkily mind it must be this evening because maitland has lot of people coming to dinner and we ca possibly leave the the crisis will be at midnight in the ruined chapel observed irene if she were stating the most ordinary fact but you must meet an hour before to make all sure preposterous i exclaimed it quite out of the question wander about the garden at midnight indeed what would people say if they saw us you imagine that i allow myself to be inﬂuenced by the opinion of fools inquired irene with ﬁne scorn and then suddenly changing her tactics she sobbed and prayed to grant her this one might be the last thing she would ever ask well she was very handsome and i am but human before she left i had promised to what she wished it may be imagined that i passed miserable day distracted by thousand gloomy apprehensions which increased the fatal hour approached i have mentioned that there was to be dinner party that evening lot of country neighbours maitland explained they like big feed from time to time i put out the old port and my wife wears her smartest dress and all the diamonds it is quite fuss to persuade her to put them on she is so nervous about them being lost she always insists on my locking them up in the safe again before i go to bed of course i contradict her but pg 83 pg 84 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https the time i leave them on my table till next morning ha ha it is always best to humour ladies even when they are triﬂe unreasonable it is one of maitland little foibles that he never can resist drawing attention to the family diamonds which are remarkably ﬁne by some passing allusion of this sort nothing of any interest happened during dinner when it was at last terminated we retired to the and listened with great decorum to several pieces of music miss latouche was pressed to perform upon the harp which she did with her usual melancholy grace she was in rich white robe which enhanced the peculiarly dusky effect of her olive skin and masses of dark hair her face was very pale and to my surprise shortly after playing she complained of bad headache and went off to bed i hardly knew what to think had her courage failed her at the last and when it came to the point did she shrink from braving the opinion of the world which she af fected so thoroughly to despise so after all her boasting she is bolder than the rest of us i thought with intense relief i wandered across the hall to join the other men in the the last guest had departed and very soon the whole house would be at rest the night how i shall laugh at her i muttered never again will she my meditations were interrupted by an icy touch on my wrist turning i saw irene by my side with dark cloak thrown over her evening dress without speaking word she drew towards side door into the garden which was seldom used and producing key from her pocket opened it noiselessly we ca go out at this time of night i gasped making faint effort to break loose i have even hat it really past joke remember your promise she whispered in voice of such awful menace that feeling all resistance was useless i followed her out into the darkness at that moment sudden gust of wind slammed the door now what shall we i exclaimed there is handle and the key is inside hush she whispered more of these trivialities i tell you the spirits are abroad the air is thick with unseen forms obey in silence or you are lost speechless with annoyance my teeth chattering with cold and general creepiness i followed her through the shrubberies until we reached the site of ruined chapel which had originally joined on to the old wing of the house of this building little remained except portions of the outer walls overgrown with ivy the pavement had long since disappeared and was replaced by rank growth of grass and weeds amongst which lay scattered such monumental remains had survived the general destruction only one window of the house happened to look out in this direction i could see light shining through the blind and with touch drew irene attention to it not alarm yourself with vain fears she whispered it is only maitland room all will be quiet soon she spoke the light was suddenly extinguished only then did i realise the full horrors of my position when that candle went out the last link which bound to civilization seemed to have snapped i was at the mercy of an enthusiast who had broken loose from all those conventional trammels which i hold in such respect although i had the greatest admiration irene nothing would have surprised less than if my murdered remains had been found next morning half hidden in the dank grass of the ruined chapel we were standing in the deep shadow of the old wall the silence was intense indeed after irene injunctions i hardly dared breathe fear of drawing down some misfortune on my devoted head not that i quite believed anything was going to happen only it was best to be on the safe side suddenly the stillness was broken by the distant sound of the stable clock striking twelve it has come whispered irene stooping towards with an expression of the utmost anxiety now you must obey absolutely or we shall both incur the wrath of the unseen powers wavering we have gone too far to recede first to establish the electric current between us pg 85 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https must hold ﬁrmly by the wrist and pass your hand slowly up and down my arm repeating these words after i hesitated the proceeding struck extraordinary will you imperil us both muttered irene in such tone of agony that i seized her arm and began to rub my life i remember noticing that it was cold and white the arm of marble statue meanwhile irene repeated an invocation apparently in the same language in which she had addressed at our ﬁrst meeting and i imitated her to the best of my ability after this had been going on few minutes she inquired in whisper if i felt anything unusual i considered that my sensations were quite sufﬁciently peculiar to justify my replying in the afﬁrmative she appeared satisﬁed all will be well my friend she murm ured sinking down with an air of exhau stion on the lid of an ancient stone cofﬁn that lay half overgrown with ivy at our feet the danger will be averted if you act with courage only keep your hold on my hand and the unseen inﬂuences have power to hurt us now drink this with these words she offered small bottle of dull blue colour and very curious shape i examined the little ﬂask suspiciously i had hazy impression that i had once seen something like it in the british museum never can i reveal by what means i procured this invaluable treasure and the precious ﬂuid that it contains replied irene in answer to my inquisitive glance sufﬁce it to say that countless ages they lay concealed in the cerements of mummy that settled i instantly resolved that power on earth should induce to taste the nasty mess bright thought occurred to would base my refusal upon grounds which even irene could scarcely combat i am dreadfully sorry i whispered but it upsets to drink anything except water in fact i ca it the consequences would be too horrible i need not particularise but literally i could keep it down minute so it seems hardly worth while to risk wasting this valuable ﬂuid and am i to be bafﬂed at this hour by human weakness cried irene stamping with suppressed rage it shall not be ha i have it the odour alone may be sufﬁciently powerful to work our purpose and uncorking the bottle she held it towards the smell was pungent but not disagreeable now all is completed she said when i had inhaled few whiffs you have only to gaze before you and wish with all the force of your will that my beloved may appear we stood perfectly still hand clasped in hand irene had risen from her grim seat and was leaning against support her cloak had fallen off and i thought that she looked like beautiful spirit herself against the dark background of ivy in obedience to her orders i ﬁxed my eyes on space and tried to wish hardly had i begun when ﬁgure emer ged from behind the opposite wall and glided slowly across the chapel towards us i was so amazed that i could hardly believe the evidence of my senses irene she only smiled with ineffable bliss if it were exactly what she had expected all along it was rather cloudy night so that i had great difﬁculty in following the movements of the mysterious ﬁgure when it gained the centre of the chapel it paused and then slowly turned towards the wall of the house far i could see it was making some wild motion with its upraised arms whether of benediction or menace it was impossible to discern at that distance but i could not shake off horrid impression that it was cursing the slumbering inmates and then wonderful to relate whilst my eyes were ﬁxed upon the dark ﬁgure it began slowly to rise into the air at this portentous sight i mind confessing that my hair fairly bristled with horror fortunately the preservation of my reason at that instant the moon gleaming from behind cloud revealed long ladder planted against mr maitland window pg 86 pg 87 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https moment i recovered my stay am going to leave you short time i whispered irene clung to with both hands and expressed fear that the outraged spirits would tear us in pieces if we moved bother the spirits i replied in gruff whisper i swear it will be the worse you if you make fuss now she sobbed and wrung her hands but the time was past that to have any effect upon and disengaging myself from her grasp i crept away hiding well i could behind the scattered ruins in this manner i contrived almost to reach the foot of the ladder without being discovered i had strange fancy capturing the thief and monopolising all the glory of saving the famous diamonds waiting patiently until he had just reached the window i rushed forward and seized the ladder it use resisting i shouted if you give up quietly i shake at this point second ﬁgure stepped out from behind laurel bush and effectually silenced any further threats by dealing heavy blow on the head days i lay insensible from concussion of the brain when i was at last pronounced convalescent maitland was admitted to my room being bound by solemn promises not to excite in any way with heartfelt gratitude he shook my hand and thanked saving the family diamonds i shall take better care of them in the future he said catch leaving them about in my again they shall always go straight back into the safe maitland was right about that though it would to confess it precious lucky that you heard the burglars and ran out though i would advise you to try and tackle two muscular rufﬁans by yourself another time it was just chance that one broke his leg when you pulled down the ladder otherwise they would have ﬁnished you of f before we arrived on the scene i may here remark that i never thought it necessary to correct the version of the story which i found was already generally accepted to this day maitland ﬁrmly believes that i was just getting into bed when with supernatura l acuteness i divined the presence of robbers under his window and creeping quietly out attacked them in the rear is miss latouche still staying here i presently inquired in calm voice i could command she left suddenly the day after your accident she complained of feeling upset by the affair and wished to go home we did not press her to stay she is liable to nervous attacks which are rather alarming why that very night curiously enough i met her evidently walking in her sleep down the passage i rushed out at your shout she passed quite close to without making any sign and was quite unconscious of it next fact referred with some surprise to having slept all through the row has she always had these peculiar ways i asked with interest well i always thought her an imaginative fanciful sort of girl but she has certainly been much worse since that poor fellow death what you never heard the story it was at picnic and she insisted upon his climbing some rocks to get her certain ﬂower just the sake of giving trouble girls the poor lad foot slipped and he rolled right over precipice and was dashed to pieces of course it was shocking thing but it pity she became so morbid about it real blame attached to her now i must not talk too much or the doctor will say i have tired you so the present and that was the last i heard of irene latouche pg 88 the project gutenberg ebook of the argosy vol li 1 january https end of the project gutenberg
