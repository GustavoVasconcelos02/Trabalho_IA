emerald and gold bailey aldrich the hawks among the birds that are most useful to man may be classed the hawks they with the vultures the eagles and the owls belong to the bird order raptores or birds of prey unlike the vultures the hawks feed upon living prey birds and nature volume ix number 2 https former seek the dead or dying animal the vultures are often called nature s scavengers and in many localities they have been so carefully protected that they will frequent the streets of towns seeking food in the gutters the family falconidae which includes the hawks the falcons the vultures the kites and the diurnal birds of about three hundred and ﬁfty species of which between forty and ﬁfty are found in north america the remainder are distributed throughout the world the ﬂight of the hawks is more than beautiful it is majestic even when perched high in the air on the top of dead monarch of the forest there is silent dignity in their pose it is from these perches that some of the species watch the surrounding country their prey swooping down upon it when observed and seizing it in their long sharp and curved claws their food is almost invariably captured while on the wing the bill which is short hooked and with sinuate cutting edges is used tearing the ﬂesh of its victim into shreds among our more common hawks there are but ﬁve or six that may truthfully be classed among the birds that are injurious to the interests of man among these the cooper s hawk and the hawk deserve the most attention they feed almost entirely upon other birds and poultry to these two the name chicken hawk may be aptly applied the domestic pigeon is dainty morsel these ravagers of the barnyard on the other hand by far the larger number of the hawks are of great value to man they are gluttonous whenever the food supply is unlimited and their powers of digestion are wonderfully developed it takes but short time the food to be absorbed and they are then ready more with their keen eyesight they readily detect the rodents and other small mammals that are so destructive to crops and with remarkable swiftness of ﬂight they pounce upon them fisher says of the rapacious birds with which our country is so well furnished there are but few which deserve to be put on the black list and pursued without mercy the greater number either pass their whole lives in the constant performance of acts of direct beneﬁt to man or else more than make good the harm they in the destruction of insectivorous birds and poultry by destroying much greater number of mammals well known to be hostile to the farmer fisher obtained the following resul ts from the examination of the stomachs of two thousand two hundred and twelve birds of prey this number does not include any of those that feed extens ively upon game and poultry in three and per centum the remains of poultry or game birds were found eleven per centum contained remains of other birds and per centum contained the remains of mice in fourteen per centum other mammals were found and per centum contained insect remains this summary includes not only the hawks but also the owls eagles and related birds it is evident from these results that man has friend in these birds that is of inestimable value to birds and nature volume ix number 2 https young hawk holding quail buteo borealis american hawk archibuteo lagopus about from joseph steppan the use of falcons and hawks in the chase dates far back in the history of the old world ages it was one of the principal sports of mankind and especially of the nobility hawks may be trained to high degree of efﬁciency in the capturing of other birds it is said that the chinese knew of this characteristic of the hawks at least two thousand years before the time of christ in japan the art of falconry was practiced about six or seven hundred years before christ the art is also believed to be represented in found in the khorsahad ruins in which falconer is apparently bearing hawk on his wrist thus these ancient ruins of nineveh show that the art must have been known at least seventeen hundred years before christ that falconry was known to the ancient races of africa is highly probable though there is but little in the earlier written history of that continent regarding it egyptian carvings and drawings however indicate without doubt that the art was there known centuries ago falconry is still practiced to some extent in africa the art though not obsolete in those countries of europe where in the middle ages it was regarded the greatest and most noble of all sports is not national in its character during the reign of william the conqueror laws were enacted in england which were most stringent regarding falconry at one time falcons and hawks were allotted to degrees and orders of men according to rank and station to royalty the jerfalcon to an earl the peregrine to yeoman the goshawk to priest the and to knave or servant the useless birds and nature volume ix number 2 https train hawk this sport requires great skill and patience the temper disposition and in fact every peculiarity of each individual bird must be carefully studied in these respects it may be said that two birds are exactly alike technically the name falcon used by the falconer is applied only to the female of the various species used in the conducting of this sport the peregrine falcon or hawk is usually accepted the type falcon of falconry the name peregrine from the latin peregrinus means wandering and refers to the fact that this species is almost cosmopolitan though the geographical races are given varietal names the duck hawk falco peregrinus anatum is one of the representatives in america the food of this hawk consists almost exclusively of birds of which water and shore birds form the greater the hawks of our illustration are natives of north america ranging from mexico northward the american legged hawk archibuteo lagopus is geographical variety of form that is found in northern europe and asia it is also known by the names of black and black hawk this hawk is one of the largest and most attractive of all the species of north america fisher tells us that it is mild and gentle in disposition and even when adult may be tamed in the course of few days so that it will take food from the hand and allow its head and back to be stroked when caged with other species of hawks it does not rule ﬁght the food but waits until the others have ﬁnished before it begins to in spite of its large size and apparent strength it does not exhibit the spirit that is so characteristic of the falcons it preys almost entirely on ﬁeld mice and other rodents frogs and probably at times and in certain localities upon insects especially the grasshoppers it is said that they will feed upon lizards snakes and toads they not molest the poultry of the farmer or the game birds of the ﬁeld forest or of our water courses at least not to any extent their size and their slow and heavy ﬂight would nearly always give sufﬁcient warning to permit the ordinary fowls to seek cover better evidence to the character of its food can be furnished than the results of the examination of stomachs related by fisher of these forty contained mice ﬁve other mammals one lizards one the remains of seventy insects this specimen was killed in nebraska and four were empty it is interesting to note that the southern limit of its wanderings in winter is nearly coincident with the southern boundary of the region inhabited by meadow sir john richardson says in the softness and fullness of its plumage its feathered legs and habits this bird bears some resemblance to the owls it ﬂies slowly sits long time on the bough of tree watching mice frogs and is often seen sailing over swampy pieces of ground and hunting its prey by the subdued daylight which illuminates even the midnight hours in the high parallels of ridgway says noble presence and piercing eye this bird has few equals among our the eggs of this species vary from two to ﬁve and are usually somewhat blotched or irregularly marked with chocolate brown on dull white background the hawk buteo borealis of our illustration is young and shows the plumage of the immature form this species may be called our winter hawk and this reason the name borealis is most appropriate the coldest days of january serve to give this hawk keener eye and deeper zest the the best locality to seek the may be found at the wooded borders of pastures and streams where it can easily perceive and swoop down upon its prey it seldom visits barnyard but will occasionally catch fowl that has strayed away from the protection of buildings its food consists to great extent of meadow and other species of mice rabbits and other rodents the remains of toads frogs and snakes have also been found in its stomach one writer says the hawk is powerful bird and i once saw one strike muskrat which it tore to pieces and devoured the greater fisher gives an interesting summary of the examination of ﬁve hundred and stomachs contained poultry or game birds other birds two hundred and contained mice one hundred and other mammals frogs and related animals or reptiles insects eight crawﬁsh one centipedes thirteen offal and were empty this surely is not bad showing this bird so often maligned by being called hen or its preferred food is evidently the smaller mammals and it is common or even abundant it must be of great value to agricultural interests the younger birds are more apt to take poultry because of lack of skill in procuring sufﬁcient quantity of the more usual prey silloway says none of the hawks has suffered more undeserved persecution than has the buzzard or hawk whose characteristics place it among the ignoble falcons or hawks of feudal times lacking the swiftness and impetuosity of attack peculiar to the true falcons it depends on its ability to surprise its prey and drop upon it when unable to during the summer months it retires to the forests to breed where it builds large and bulky though shallow nest in trees often at height of from ﬁfty to feet from the ground the nest is constructed of sticks and small twigs and lined with grass moss feathers or other soft materials the number of eggs is usually three though birds and nature volume ix number 2 https 56may be two or four they are little over two inches long and less than two inches in diameter they are dull whitish in color and usually somewhat marked with various shades of brown the full plumage of the adult is not acquired some time and the bird has been long full grown before the characteristic red color of the tail appears seth mindwell interesting stone houses while the children were playing in small brook they found something entirely new to them and usual came with hands full shouting w have found something new you know what these are these new treasures proved to be the larvae of the caddis ﬂy in their stone houses this little creature is noted its complete metamorphosis the female ﬂy often descends to the depth of foot or more in water to deposit her eggs the eggs hatch the habits of their larvae are exceedingly interesting they are aquatic being long softish grubs with six feet the ﬁsh are very fond of them which reason they are in great demand bait the angler looks along the edges of streams under stones or on the stalks of aquatic plants one can easily see that their lives are not free from care and danger and so to protect themselves they are very wise in building cylindrical cases in which they live during this dange rous period the different species of which there are many seem to have their individual preference to the substance which they employ in building these houses some using bits of wood others shells pebbles or straws they readily disregard these preferences when there is lack of the material which they usually prefer those brought to were made of different colored pebbles and were very pretty homes we counted the pebbles in one of them and found there were used and built so securely that it could not be easily crushed by our ﬁngers they were all about an inch in length quarter of an inch in diameter and were perfect cylinders with large pebble fastening one end so ﬁsh could catch them unawares we placed them in water where we could watch their development they never willingly left their homes only thrusting the head and portion of the body out in search of food when about to pass into the torpid pupa state they fastened their houses to some sticks and stones in the water and then closed the end with strong silken grating which allowed the water to pass freely through their houses keeping them sweet and fresh we are told that this fresh water is necessary the respiration of the pupa thus they remain quiet time until they are ready to assume the imago form when that important period arrives they make an opening in the silken grating with pair of hooked jaws which seem to have developed while resting in the pupa state they also have become efﬁcient swimmers using their long hind legs to assist them after enjoying this new exercise of swimming short time they evidently become anxious wider experience and coming to the surface of the water usually climbing up some plant the skin of the swimme r

they go to new ﬁelds and new experiences these insects are known the of the order neuroptera having four wings measuring about an inch when full spread with branched nervures of which the anterior pair are clothed with hairs the posterior pair are folded in repose the head is furnished with pair of lar ge eyes with three ocelli and the antennae are generally very long if you know the haunts of

chi acad sciences the dowitcher macrorhamphus griseus the range of the dowitcher is limited to the eastern part of north america it has been reported far west the mississippi river it breeds in the far north usually within the arctic circle its migration is extensive it winters in florida the west indies and in the northern portion of south america the dowitcher is one of the best known of our coast birds it bears many popu lar names such gray snipe back dowitch driver and bay bird the generic name macrorhamphus is derived from two greek words makros meaning large and rhamphos meaning bill the speciﬁc name griseus means gray and probably has reference to the grayish color of the winter plumage the dowitchers are the most numerou s of the seaside snipes inland it is replaced by the dowitcher macrorhamphus scolopaceus which has longer bill and is little larger wilson in his ornithology gives birds and nature volume ix number 2 https interesting account of their habits they frequent the sandbars and mud of ﬂats at low water in search of food and being less suspicious of boat than of person on shore they are easily approached by this medium and shot down in great numbers i have frequently amused myself with the various actions of these birds they ﬂy rapidly sometimes wheeling coursing and doubling along the surface of the marshes then shooting high in the air there separating and forming in various bodie s uttering kind of quivering at the retreat of the tide ﬂocks will frequently settle on the shore in such large numbers and so close together that several dozen have been killed at single shot chapman tells us that they migrate in compact ﬂocks which are easily attracted to decoys by an imitation of their call and bars exposed by the falling tide are their chosen feeding grounds on the gulf coast of florida i have seen several hundred gathered in such close rank that they entirely concealed the sandbar on which they were in summer the general color of these birds is and the feathers are more or less edged with reddish tinge underneath the general color is light cinnamon with white on the belly in the winter the plumage is more gray and the under parts are much lighter in color this bird usually lays four eggs of buf fy olive color which are marked by brown especially near the lar ger end all the beautiful stars of the sky the silver doves of the forest of night over the dull earth swarm and ﬂy companions of our ﬂight thomson some things we might learn from the lower animals man has been instructed in many things by lower animals but there is yet much to be learned it is said that the ﬁrst suspension bridge across the niagara was constructed after the plainest sort of hint from spider yet we have never found the name of spider cut upon the buttresses of bridge who knows but that the builders of the pyramids of ancient egypt copied their engineering plans from the ants who generations had pursued similar methods in the architecture of their cities spiders had been ballooning many centuries before man swung his ﬁrst parachute to the breeze in fact there is species of spider which although they have wings are able to spin themselves sort of apparatus by means of which they navigate the air yet man with all his boasted intelligence has not accomplished this even with the most complicated machinery so i might go on to suggest many mechanical and economic contrivances used by lower animals some of which man has copied but many of which he has yet been unable to equal before the ﬁrst potter of old had fashioned vase or jug the eumenes fraterna had constructed his dainty little jugs of mud but the making of jugs is not the only art man might learn from this little wasp upon examination we ﬁnd the jug ﬁlled with small green caterpillars after depositing her egg wasp thus provides her baby when it shall appear upon the ﬁeld of action now the peculiar part of this proceeding to which i wish to call attention is that the worm is not dead but is merely in comatose state if it had been killed it would have putriﬁed and entirely disappeared before the young wasp was hatched furthermore the young wasp is fond of fresh caterpillar steak preferably from the living animal so wasp must have method of preserving the fresh living victim her rapacious progeny next spring while he is too young to hunt himself and while the caterpillars are still securely hiding in their mummy cases wasp ﬁnds the venturesome young caterpillar crawling somewhere and pouncing upon him carefully inserts her sting into the nerve ganglia that are located in line along his dorsal surface we don t know how she learned the exact location of the ganglia and that few stabs will produce more effect than hundreds of misdirected thrusts in other parts of the body but it is certainly true that she selects the very segments in which the ganglia are located to inﬂict the wound and she had the location of these nerve centers long time before biologists made the discovery what ﬁne thing it would be the biologist if he could learn the secret of thus preserving living animals instead of the stiff discolored and uninteresting alcoholic specimens then think of the economic value of such discovery animals could be fattened in summer at much smaller expense and then injected and set away until needed we would have more difﬁculty in providing our armies with beef on the hoof and fresh meat could be shipped at much less expense over long distances ice would be necessary we would have more complaint of embalmed beef and putrid canned goods the common mud wasp that builds in old garrets ﬁlls his nest with species of spider much relished by the young wasp and exhibits much judgment in supplying exactly the right number to provide the growing wasp until he birds and nature volume ix number 2 https 62able to sally forth and seize prey himself these seventeen or eighteen of stupeﬁed in the same manner in the case of the potter wasp and are living when the young wasp begins his repast this habit is peculiar to many species of wasp and is i think worthy of careful study i wish i had space to tell of the almost ﬁendish ingenuity that certain parasites show in maintaining themselves at the expense of their hosts the ground hog has knack of spending his winter in way that is at once economical and pleasant they generally hibernate in pairs rolling themselves up into balls they not seem to breathe or to perform any of the life functions during their long six months sleep there is i fear foundation of fact the ancient ﬁction of the ground hog appearing and making weather prognostications on the second of february gentleman writing in the new york sun of some years since says i took the trouble once to dig into woodchuck s burrow on candlemas day and warm cloudy day it was just such day when the ground hog is said to come out of his hole and stay out i found two woodchucks in the burrow with more signs of life about them than if they had been shot and killed from all outward appearances i could have taken them out and had game of football with them without their knowing nor is it true that hibernating animals live upon their accumulated fat digestion well other active life processes ceases hibernating animals always begin their long sleep upon an empty stomach and food injected into their stomach is not digested the fat disappears it is true but it is not in any strict sense digested any experienced hunter is aware that unless the entrails are removed from the shot rabbit the fat will disappear from about the kidneys the fat may and doubt does assist in some way in the long sleep it may act fuel to keep up the right living temperature at any rate it is true that hibernating animals eat voraciously and grow very fat just before they go to sleep it is peculiar fact that many hibernating animals bring forth their young during this period this is especially true of woodchucks and bears it is common experience with hunters that only male bears are killed during the winter season andrew fuller of ridgewood new jersey according to the article above quoted had an interesting experience with pair of rocky mountain ground squirrels after missing them month he accidentally found them curled up under some straw apparently frozen stiff he brought them to the house to show his wife the misfortune that had befallen his pets soon they seemed to thaw out and scampered about lively ever sooner were they put out in the cold than they resumed their sleep which continued all winter their bodies maintaining fairly constant temperature seldom falling below three degrees above the freezing point of water they came out in the spring chipper if they had been asleep but one night many hibernating animals will if wakened by being placed in warm room eat eagerly but they soon show desire to resume their nap the loir peculiar little native of senegal never hibernates in its native clime but every specimen brought to europe becomes torpid when exposed to cold the common land he may be and he is voracious eater of almost goes to sleep in november and wakes some time in may just in the north numerous animals hibernate upon approach of cold so in the south there are species that may be said to estivate during the hottest weather while the northern animals curl up so to retain heat his southern cousin straightens out much possible to allow the heat to escape from all parts of the body but it was not my intention to write an essay upon hibernation and allied phenomena but merely to speak of it subject that should be investigated what splendid arrangement it would be the poor the sick and the melancholy folk if they could just hibernate six months occasionally i will merely speak of the light of the so called lightning bug with its over ninety per centum efﬁciency and heat and consumption of fuel to speak of why doesn t some genius learn her language and ﬁnd out how she does it she has been trying centuries to demonstrate it but we are too stupid to learn her secret rowland watts the grackle quiscalus macrourus the grackle belongs to family of birds that is eminently characteristic of the new world all the species being peculiar to it is the family of the blackbird and oriole of the bobolink and the meadowlark it is called the icteridae from greek word ikteros meaning yellow bird the majority of the one hundred and ﬁfty or more species that are grouped in this family make their home in the tropics where their brilliant colors are emphasized by the ever green foliage and the bright sunshine the family is interesting because the species though closely related vary so widely in their habits they are found living in ground of every nature from dry plains and wet marshes to the densest forest here are classed some of the birds which are among the most beautiful of our songsters here too are classed some species that birds and nature volume ix number 2 https musical sound and whose voices are harsh and rough the sexes are usually dissimilar the female being the smaller and generally much duller in color the grackle is native of eastern texas and the country southward into central america the grackles are sometimes called crow blackbirds there are ﬁve species all found in the united states the bronzed and the purple grackles are the most generally distributed and best known the grackle well the other species usually builds rude and bulky nests in trees sometimes at quite height from the ground it will also nest in shrubs and it is said that it will occasionally select holes in large trees the males are an iridescent black in color and the females are brown and much smaller both sexes spend most of their time on the ground their feet are strong and lar ge and when upon the ground they walk or run and never hop the eagle he clasps the crag with hooked hands close to the sun in lonely lands ring d with the azure world he stands the wrinkled sea beneath him crawls he watches from his mountain walls and like thunderbolt he falls tennyson grackle quiscalus macrourus ½ from chi acad sciences the geographical distribution of birds and nature volume ix number 2 https we mean by the geographical distribution of birds are not birds to be found everywhere over both land and sea are they not then universally distributed class they certainly are but not species nor even orders parrots are not found in frigid regions nor are snowﬂakes and snowy owls found in the tropical regions our wood warblers and vireos are not found outside of america while there are birds of paradise anywhere in america we shall see that most of the birds found in the eastern hemisphere differ from those found in the western speaking broadly but that many of the island birds are dif ferent from birds of continents since most birds migrate shorter or longer distances in search of place to rear their young and return again to warmer regions to pass the winter months the question at once arises what is the geographical distribution of such migratory birds that is not so difﬁcult it may seem at ﬁrst glance we have only to inquire what governs the movements of the species in question in such way that its appearance at certain places at certain known times may be conﬁdently expected the study of migration and breeding has shown that the impulse to move northward in the spring to the old where the young are reared is more reliable than the impulse to move southward on the approach of cold the birds are more certain to appear at their old summe r homes in spring than they are to be found at any particular place during the winter but if there be any objection to this view it will yet remain true that where bird rears its young should more properly be called its home than the place to which it is forced by the approach of cold or the lack of food in either case therefore we may regard the home of the bird and therefore treat its distribution geographically the place where it habitually rears its young having settled the question to what shall determine the distribution of the separate species it remains to study the physical conditions of the earth the sake of ﬁnding what it is that determines the limits to which the dif ferent species may go we know that the distribution of land and water over the earth has not always been the same it is now but that many places that are now covered with water were once dry land and that in many places where there is now land there used to be water now america is wholly separated from but once they were connected together by broad neck of land where bering sea now lies and there may have been another neck of land connecting europe with iceland and greenland and so with north america now australia and new zealand are wholly separated from all other lands but they were not so long ago so of the larger islands in general they have not always been isolated now but connected with great land masses sharing with them the animals which roamed over the whole vast regions in the earlier times before man had appeared upon the earth before the great glacial period the whole earth was tropical in climate making it possible plants well animals to live anywhere upon the earth they can not now then extensive migrations north and south were not necessary but instead there were roamings about in all directions or great invasions of new regions by hosts of animals of one kind the land sank away here and there and the sea covered it barriers were thus formed to further roamings except by the birds of strong ﬂight or animals that could swim long distances and there could longer be an intermingling of the animals of the whole land surface of the world since all animals are inclined to change somewhat to meet or keep pace with the changes that are going on in vegetation and the general physical conditions of the earth those that have been separated in this way will grow more and more unlike in some such isolated regions there may not be much change in their environment and so they will change but little if at all and so will not keep pace with those in other regions where life is constant struggle with others supremacy it is just true in the natural world in the commercial that competition is necessary the highest development it is probably true that the disturbances which caused the land to sink in places and so disconnect what had been connected lands possibly splitting up of one great ﬂat land mass also brought about the changes which made out of one great tropical world the one that we know with its frigid temperate and tropical zones so that just at the time when the animals of the different regions were separated from each other forever there came these changes in physical conditions which would make them change to meet the new conditions but that is long story the geologist to tell of course the sinking of the land in different regions occurred at different times probably thousands of years apart in many cases and the changes from tropical to temperate and frigid must have been very gradual also or there would have been animals left alive in the northern and southern regions only those near the equator could have lived probably new zealand was the ﬁrst considerable land mass to be separated absolutely and all time from all other land because here we ﬁnd the lowest type of birds and lower animals there are terrestrial indigenous mammals even such birds were not able to ﬂy across the now wide stretches of ocean did not continue to develop rapidly because there was little change in their environment and because there was little or competition with other similar forms so we ﬁnd them either very similar to what they were when their island home was made an island home or else even degenerated into ﬂightless creatures australia seems to have been the next tract of land cut off here too we meet with the lower forms which show the lack of the keen competition which their relatives further north had to sustain when north america was cut off from siberia marking the close of more or less extensive interchange of communication of the animals of both regions there was little difference in their animal life but following this separation there came about more rapid change in the orient than in the occident it may not be quite clear why this was so but that it was can not be doubted some of the lower forms of animals which still inhabit america have been completely destroyed in the orient at the time of their separation these forms were found in both places what seems probable explan ation of this more rapid change in the orient may be brieﬂy stated the conﬁguration of the orient is such that animals would have far greater range east and west than north and south great mountain range and great desert are thrown barriers across the way of the northward and southward movement in america there is continuous gateway to the north and south but barriers to an eastward or westward movement with such creatures the birds freedom to move north and south would always lessen competition birds and nature volume ix number 2 https crowding of one group or race upon another eastward or westward would increase the competition but geology tells us that in the orient such westward invasions have actually occurred causing the death of the less hardy forms and the modiﬁcation of all forms of animal life it must not be understood from what has been said that all the animals especia lly the birds found in any one country or island are different from the birds found in all others that is not true there are many species of birds that are found practically all over the earth but what is true is that each country or region of any considerable extent or group of oceanic islands has some species which are not found anywhere else in the world from what has already been said it will be clear that the world may be divided into several different regions according to the animals which are peculiar to the different ones following newton s system because it seems the most logical at least so far the birds are concerned we have ﬁrst the new zealand region here we ﬁnd the ﬂightless apteryx and ﬂightless goose now extinct also the extinct moa there are also peculiar forms among the the birds of prey the parrots and some rather curiously constituted passerine birds there have been several species introduced in relatively recent times some of which already show signs of change the australian region is but slightly connected with the preceding the line separating this region from the indian passes between the islands of bali and lombok through the strait of macassar between borneo and celebes thence northward between the philippines and sanguir and pelew including further on the ladrones hawaiians all of polynesia except the northern outliers of the new zealand group and ﬁnally sweeping back to encompass australia here we ﬁnd the curious mammal ornithorhynchus but to pass at once to the birds here we ﬁnd such peculiar forms the megapodes cassowaries and many not so familiar of the higher birds there are but few compared with europe or america it is evidently continent which has long been separated from the rest of the world the neotropical region includes broadly tropical america the forms found here bear certain resembla nces to those found in the two regions already discussed but this resemblance is probably rather because they are low in the scale of development than that there has ever been any direct land connection between them much the same conditions of life must have prevailed all thus making the rate of development nearly equal here we ﬁnd the rhea tinamou and hoactzin which show low grade but mingling freely with them the higher forms which seem to have come down from the north later and all but crowded out these lower ones there is abundant evidence that the struggle existence in south america has been far less severe than in north america the holarctic region the name implies includes all of north america europe asia north of india and the himalaya mountains northern africa where the great sahara forms the natural boundary and all islands belonging to the north temperate and north frigid zones many have divided this great belt into palearctic and nearctic but the intermingling of species between northeast siberia and alaska seems to make such distinction impracticable but these distinctions should be and are retained in the divisions of the holarctic when we understand that at least of the species found in the nearctic are also found in the palearctic we shall understand why these two are grouped under one region there are orders and there seem to be families which are found in the holarctic and nowhere else indeed it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd even genera which not have some species ranging into the neotropical ethiopian or indian but among the species we ﬁnd many indeed there are few species which nest in both the holarctic and in the regions bounding it on the south and many of these are found only on the southern boundaries of the holarctic in our part of the holarctic that is the nearctic the familiar birds about us not nest also in the tropical regions the ethiopian birds and nature volume ix number 2 https the name suggests includes the whole of africa except that portion north of the sahara desert and arabia and egypt with madagascar and other islan ds in the immediate vicinity it seems hardly necessary to even mention the forms that are peculiar to this peculiar region even the word africa brings trooping to our minds whole continent of peculiarities in more realms than one here we ﬁnd the ostrich the plantain eaters the colies and several other in all of the lower groups there are the rollers the curious and many others it is signiﬁcant that among the passerine birds there are but three families that are peculiar so on the whole this region has not developed so rapidly the holarctic there has not been the intense struggle supremacy here which we see in the north temperate and higher regions the indian region completes the list broadly speaking this region comprises that part of asia which lies east of the indus river south of the himalaya mountains except the eastern half of the drainage basin of the river reaching the coast just south of shanghai including the island of formosa the philippines borneo java sumatra and ceylon this is the oriental region of wallace there are apparently but two families of birds peculiar to this region the bulbuls and the but there are very many genera and species found nowhere else in the world the birds argus pheasant jungle fowl and the peacocks belong here very many of the birds of this region are gaudily colored and striking in appearance each of these great regions except possibly new zealand are readily divisible into and these again into areas of lesser extent until each fauna may be assigned its proper place thus in the holarctic region we recognize the nearctic which comprises about all of north america and palearctic the outlines of which have already been sketched within the near ctic three minor regions are recognized the arctic includes that part of the continent and its adjacent islands north of about the limit of forest vegetation allen that is extreme northern and northwestern alaska sweeping southea sterly through british america to and including hudson bay northern and northeastern labrador and northern newfoundland the cold temperate which lies next south begins in the east near quebec then sweeps westward past the great lakes almost to winnipeg thence in northwesterly direction just west of lake winnipeg from there in more westerly direction to the mountains which it follows even into northern mexico narrow line from the west coast at the north end of vancouver island it runs east to the mountains maine and nova scotia are part of the allegheny belt which reaches to alabama below this southern limit of the cold temperate lies the warm temperate extending almost to central america but this is again subdivided into an eastern humid province which ends at the plains and western arid province these are again subdivided into an appalachian subprovince and an austroriparian subprovince the humid province and sonoran and campestrian subprovince the arid province but the boundaries of these minor subdivisions are not yet deﬁnitely settled nor are the characteristic species in each ﬁnally decided upon so it will not be proﬁtable to carry our investigation further at this time we learn from this that when we ﬁnd that one region be it large or small is unlike every other region in some particulars of climate or vegetation or temperature or when it is not easily accessible from other regions we may expect to ﬁnd the animals somewhat different according to the conditions which prevail from this it is clear step to the truth that an animal s environment exerts considerable inﬂuence upon its life and through its life upon its form changing the form in some particulars that make it different from all other animals it is also true of plants since then there are different physical condi tions in every country of any considerable size these changes in plants and animals are going on now but so slowl y that we are not able to see them at the end of another thousand years or longer the species of birds which we now know may be so changed that we should not know them if we could see them but that need not worry us lynds birds and nature volume ix number 2 https hooded warbler silvania

arrangement of the black and yellow colors on the head it is called the warbler the hooded flycatching warbler the mitred warbler and the warbler activity seems to be the keynote of its life it is in constant pursuit of insects which it catches while they are on the wing unlike the ﬂycatchers it seldom returns to the same perch from which it ﬂew to catch its prey birds and nature volume ix number

rather to court my presence almost every moment was spent in capturing insects on the wing or in sitting on perch watching them to ﬂash into view like genuine ﬂycatcher soon buzzing insect hove in sight he would dart out after it and never once failed to secure his prize sometimes he would plunge swiftly downward after gnat or miller and once having caught miller that was large and inclined to be refractory he ﬂew to the ground beat it awhile on the clods and then swallowed it with consequential air which seemed to say that is my way of disposing of such cases several times he mounted almost straight up from his perch and twice he almost turned somersault in pursuit of an insect once he clung like titmouse to the hole of to some its notes which are quite musical lively sweet and

present paper we desire to draw the attention of the reade r to the order pulmonata which includes those snails breathing air by means of modiﬁed lung the snails differ from the clams in having the body generally protected by spiral shell which is capable of containing the entire animal the former have more or less expanded creeping disk which we call foot head generally separated from the body by neck the reader will remember that the clams are headless and also pair of rather long eye peduncles protruding from the top of the head which bear at their tips the round black eyes and pair of short tactile organs or tentacles extending from the lower part of the head the are peculiar in being invertible in the same manner that kid glove ﬁnger is pulled inside out the mouth is placed in the lower plane of the head and is recognized externally simple slit inside of the mouth is placed one of the most wonderful dental apparatuses known to science this is called the radula odontophore or and is belt of chitinous transparent yellowish or colorless material its upper surface being armed with numerous siliceous teeth arranged in longitudinal and parallel rows the radula is placed in an organ called the buccal sac and occupies position in the sac analogous to that of the tongue in cat or dog on the ﬂoor of the mouth it is formed from layer of cells in the posterior part of the buccal sac calle d the radula sac and new teeth are constantly forming here to take the place of those which have become worn by use the whole radula rests upon cartilage is strongly fastened at the anterior end and is brought down between the two ﬂeshy lips of the mouth where it performs backward and forward movement thus rasping off with the sharp teeth particles of food which have been cut into small pieces by the horny jaw during this process the morsel of food is pressed against the top or roof of the mouth the jaw is placed in the upper part of the mouth in front of the radula and is frequently armed with ribs to aid in cutting or biting of f pieces of food leaves or vegetables before remarked the radula is made up of parallel rows of teeth the whole area being usually divided into ﬁve longitudinal rows each row differing from the one next to it we have ﬁrst central row on each side of this lateral row and ﬁnally marginal row each tooth in each row is made up of different parts basal part attached to the radula belt and an upper part which is turned over or reﬂexed and bent backward so to tear off food particles by backward movement of the whole appar atus this diversity of form in the teeth has led conchologists to adopt tooth formula similar to that adopted vertebrate animals so that the teeth of different species can be compared and the animals classiﬁed thereby thus each tooth has certain prominences called cusps which vary in size number and position and serve admirably to describe the different groups of snails all the mollusca except the bivalves are provided

are teeth in single row and the whole radula is made up of hundred rows of teeth making grand total of hundred teeth in the mouth of single snail land snails are found almost everywhere in valleys high up on mountains and even in deserts they may be found in the cold climate of alaska or in the tropical zone under the equator rule they prefer moist localities where there is an abundance of vegetation and where the ground is strewn with rotting logs beds of decaying leaves or rocks open woodlands may be said to be their best habitat in the northern part of the united states the shells of the pulmonata vary to wonderful degree in size shape and coloration some are so small that they can scarcely be seen with the unaided eye while others attain length of six inches some have the aperture of the shell armed with numerous folds or teeth while others are smooth and the colors vary from whitish or to the gorgeously colored helices of the tropic s with their bands and blotches of red brown white or green with all this diversity the land shells or helices may always be distinguished from their salt or relatives the land snails breathe by means of lung which is sac lined with network of blood vessels and occupying the last turn or whorl of the shell the air taken into this lung puriﬁes the blood much is written at the present time upon our new possessions the philippine islands but few people are aware that these islands are tenanted by the most interesting and beautiful group of all the land shells the cochlostylas or tree snails the animals live the most part in the trees and bushes of the islands the island of luzon having probably the best known fauna the animals are large and quite bold and the shells are of surpassing beauty with their colors of white green brown etc now that these islands have come into the possession of the united states it is to be hoped that these handsome creatures will receive the study they deserve the land shells of the united states while numerous in species are not conspicuous in color those of europe south america or the islands of the indian and paciﬁc oceans although california produces some colored species will be seen by consulting the ﬁgure of helix ﬁdelis on our plate the majority of our species are uncolored like the ﬁgure of polygyra albolabris one of the largest and most interesting of american shells is the bulimus found in south america the shell of bulimus ovatus attains length of six inches and the animal is correspondingly large in the markets of rio janeiro this mollusk is sold food and is eagerly sought by the poorer people among whom it is considered great delicacy another interesting fact in connection with this species well others of the genus is the size of the eggs which it deposits they being lar ge pigeons eggs these are also eaten with avidity by the negroes of brazil one of the most beautiful of the land shells found in the united states is the liguus fasciatus found in florida and cuba the shell is about two inches long and is encircled by bands of white brown and green this species lives in great numbers at key west associated with many small shells of the bulimus group closely related to the mentioned shell liguus is the agate shell achatina which attains length of seven inches and is the largest of the land shells like the bulimus mentioned above it lays eggs of large size with calcareous shell some being over an inch in length both the animal and the egg are eaten by the natives of africa the shells are very attractive being variegated with dif ferent colors like agate from which they receive their common name another of our new political possession s the hawaiian islands has molluscan fauna peculiar to itself this is the family achatinellidae which is conﬁned solely to the sandwich islands there are shells which can compare in beauty with the achatinella with their encircled bands of black yellow white red etc they live on the bushes generally rather low and near the ground and recently they have been threatened with extinction because of the cattle which have been introduced into the islands in feeding on the bushes

species has been introduced into new orleans where it is eaten by the french inhabitants helix nemoralis an edible snail of england with beautifully banded shell is sold in the streets of london and eaten much we eat walnuts by picking out the animal with pin the edible snails well many others make good and interesting pets in captivity the helix pomatia being of such size that it may be easily studied it is interesting to watch one of these snails feeding upon piece of lettuce first the jaw is seen to protrude and to cut off small piece of the leaf which is drawn into the mouth and reduced to still smaller pieces by the radula large piece of lettuce after this snail has made meal upon it looks if an army of worms had been at work the pomatia is also of an inquisitive disposition and will wander about the snailery or even the whole house if he can get out examining everything in very curious manner more birds and nature volume ix number 2 https can be placed in library or study than snailery with several species of snails they are far superior in interest to goldﬁsh or canaries the most interesting snails are by means the largest frequently the small snail shells with their animals have habits or shell structures of absorbing interest among these are the pupas whose tiny shells frequently reach the astounding size of of an inch in length it is not until we place these mites under the microscope that their interesting characters are seen and appreciated by such an examination we ﬁnd that the little apertures are armed with many teeth and folds and sometimes we wonder how it is that the animal ever gets in and out through such labyrinth of apparent obstructions these teeth serve in manner to protect the little animal from its enemies these tiny shells are always to be found plentifully under starting bark and under chips stones and debris in more or less moist localities in another genus of pupidae clausilia nature has provided the aperture of the shell with little valve called clausilium which acts spring door to close the shell against all its enemies this door is an additional safeguard the aperture is already provided with numerous teeth and folds in this manner does mother nature look after her children it is curious fact that in all the larger groups of animals there are one or more genera which have the cruel and bloodthirsty propensities of the shark the mollusca are exception to this rule and we ﬁnd in the genus testacella an animal having all the ferocious propensities of the terrible tiger this mollusk has long body the shell being very small and rudimentary ear shaped and placed on the extreme posterior end of the animal its principal food consists of although it will attack other mollusks and even its own species it has been likened to the tiger and the shark in its cunning while pursuing its prey and in its ferocity when attacking it the poor stands but slight chance of escape when testacella scents it and starts in pursuit the worm tries to escape by retreating into its under ground galleries but this is of avail becaus the mollusk has long narrow body and can go wherever the worm does if the worm perchance has the opportunity of retreating far into its galleries the mollusk will dig tunnels to intercept it frequently the mollusk will make sudden spring upon its victim taking it by surprise this snail will frequen tly devour snail much larger than itself but if the victim is too large one meal it will be broken in the middle and one half eaten and digested and then the meal completed with the other half the testacella also resembles the tiger and the shark in the possession of long teeth upon its radula these teeth are recurved and aid the mollusk in getting ﬁrm hold upon its victim and also assist in the operation of swallowing it is curious fact that this animal will not feed upon other dead animals nor upon fresh meat nor worms like the snake which it greatly resembles in habits it must hunt and kill its own food its wanderings are nocturnal and during the day it remains concealed buried in the earth testacella is quite long lived snails go its duration of life being about six years genus allied to testacella and having the same predaceous habits but being protected by large shell into which the whole animal can withdraw is the oleacina or glandina the shell is long with narrow aperture and shaped spire the animal is long and narrow and the head near the mouth is furnished with pair of elongated lips which may be used tentacles the south american species feed on the larger mollusks the bulimus before spoken of and the aperture of each intended victim s shell is carefully examined before any attempt is made to enter when our tiger is satisﬁed that its victim is really within it will enter the aperture and devour the animal sometimes it will make hole itself in the shell of its victim and will eat the contents through this aperture instead of the natural one in florida these animals prey upon the lar ge pulmonates like lignus and orthalicus before closing this brief sketch of the land mollusks we must not neglect to mention their wonderful protection against the cold of winter and the heat of summer this is tough leathery secretion which completely covers the aperture and its formation is thus described by mr binney in his manual of american land withdrawing into the shell it forms over the aperture membraneous covering consisting of thin mixture of lime mucus or gelatine secreted from the collar of the animal this membrane is called the epiphragm it is formed in this manner the animal being withdrawn into the shell the collar is brought to level with the aperture and quantity of mucus is poured out from it and covers it small quantity of air is then emitted from the respiratory foramen which detaches the mucus from the surface of the collar and projects it in convex form like bubble at the same moment the animal retreats farther into the shell leaving vacuum between itself and the membrane which is consequently pressed back by the external air to level with the aperture or even farther so to form concave surface where having become desiccated and hard it remains ﬁxed these operations are nearly simultaneous and occupy but an instant the weather becomes colder the animal retires farther into the shell and makes another septum and so on until there are sometimes many six of these the snails which we have so brieﬂy discussed in this article are but very limited number of the many thousand species of this very interestin g group of animals their shells are easily gathered and require but little trouble to prepare the cabinet and study the writer therefore trusts that what has been written may act stimulus and induce many to take up the collection and study of these beautiful birds and nature volume ix number 2 https collins baker the gila monster heloderma suspectum the reptile fauna of the north american continent includes curious lizard known gila monster in science called heloderma it represents family all to itself with only two species heloderma horridum and heloderma suspectum francisco hernandez spanish physician and naturalist was the ﬁrst to know of its existence when he found it in mexico in the year in an account of his explorations he mentions lizard three feet long with body covered with skin gaudily colored in orange and black and generally of such horrid appearance that wiegmann another scientist two hundred years later called it heloderma horridum long time this name was given indiscriminately to all lizards of this kind living either south or north of the boundary line of mexico and the united states till professor cope discovered difference between them and called the variety found in our southwestern territories and states heloderma suspectum many other naturalists have since taken up the study of this interesting reptile the result of their observations and experiments was that they all agree in acknowledging the heloderma the only poisonous lizard in existence although their opinions are at variance to the effect of its venom on the human system van denbur gh in his latest researches has found two glands one on each side of the lower jaw locate d between the skin and the bone such gland being taken out of its enveloping membrane proves to be not single body but an agglomeration of several small ones differing in size and each emptying through separate duct these glands are not directly communicated to the teeth when the animal is highly irritated caused by constant teasing or rough handling or by being trodden upon the poison is emitted by the glands gathe rs on the ﬂoor of the mouth where it mixes with the saliva and is transmitted through the bite heloderma has fangs but goodly number of sharp pointed teeth both on the upper and lower jaws they are curved backward and about an eighth of an inch long or even less than that the principal characteristic of these teeth is that they are grooved facilitating thus the ﬂow of the venom into the wound it bites with an extremely swift dash directed sideways and holds on tenacio usly to whatever is seized with its powerful jaws sumichrast says when the reptile bites it throws itself on its back but none of the later naturalists makes mention of this peculiarity the venom of the gila monster injected into the veins and arteries of smaller animals rats cavies and rabbits and into the breast of pigeons and chickens causes death within twenty seconds to seven minutes brehm relates that young heloderma and in poor physical condition besides was induced to bite the leg of large cat which did not die but gave signs of prolonged terrible sufferings it became dull and emaciated and never regained its former good spirits among several cases of gila monster bites inﬂicted on human beings can be quoted that of shufeldt who in the american naturalist gave an interesting account of the sensations he experienced it is sufﬁcient to say that the pain starting from wound on the right thum b went like an electric shock through the whole body and was so severe to cause the victim to faint immediate treatment prevented more serious consequences the doctor nevertheless was very sick man several days and began to recover only after week had birds and nature volume ix number 2 https gila monster heloderma suspectum about ⅓ taken from life by harriet higley and frank w oodruff the constituents of the venom are yet not thoroughly known but it is said to be of an alkaline nature the opposite of snake poison which is acid it acts upon the heart the spine and the nerve centers and causes paralysis other scientists claim the saliva of the heloderma is poisonous only in certain cases and under certain circumstances it may also depend upon the physical condition of the victim at the time the venom enters into the system yet there is little doubt that if help is not at hand immediately the bite may prove fatal the apaches stand in dire fear of this animal so that at least with their older people amount of money seems tempting enough to make them go near it much less to capture one former resident of the territories says both indians and mexicans believe ﬁrmly that if gila monster only breathes in your face it is quite sufﬁcient to cause immediate death on an old indian trail good day s journey west from the present site of phoenix can be found crudely outlined on the face of rock the picture of two helodermas pursuing man who runs to save his life numerous hieroglyphic inscriptions tell probably the story of the event and prove not only the prehistoric origin of this primitive piece of art but also the erroneous ideas which were prevalent in these remote times the reptile never attacks and never pursues it is safe to say that the animal has been vastly misrepresented at all ages nature has kindly provided the heloderma with compensation its partially undeserved bad reputation in giving it beauty whosoever looks upon ﬁne specimen with unprejudiced eyes can not fail to admire at least the combination of its colors and especially the odd capriciously disposed markings the delicately tinted skin studded in transverse rows with shiny tubercles like so many beads on strings the illustration to this paper is so excellently made that scarcely any description is necessary to the animal s exterior in color and markings this heloderma is little over nineteen inches in length by ten inches in circumference of the body and ﬁve inches at the thickest part of the tail which makes of the total length of the body when such reptile grows to the size of eighteen inches it is calle d adult those growing beyond these ﬁgures are unusually large specimens and in very rare instances the species of our illustration reaches the extraordinary length of two feet an adult gila monster weighs about two or three pounds and in winter less than in summer the four short and stubby legs seem quite out of proportion to the massive body much more so the two pairs are widely separated lengthwise of the body when walking the body is elevated while in rest it lies ﬂat on the ground each foot is provided with ﬁve digits armed with curved white claws the skin has generally the appearance if covered with rows of uniform beads but on closer examination these beads or more correctly tubercles prove to have different shapes and are differently set according to the part of the body which they cover on the head from the nose up to between the eyes they are ﬂat irregularly cut closely joined and adhere completely to the skull those following form polygonal eminences each one separated from the other by circle of tiny dermal granulations while behind the eyes on both sides of the head they are larger and stand far apart the throat and the nape of the neck are studded with very closely set small tubercles increasing in birds and nature volume ix number 2 https 85only above the forelegs whence they extend in transverse rows along the whole upper side of the body and the tail the under side of the latter and the abdomen are covered with tessellated scales of and dull yellow color arranged in another handsome pattern heloderma s head with its triangular shape is very like that of venomous snake it gives the when it is raised in truly appearance the mouth reaches far behind the eyes these are very small and like all lizards provided with that close when the animal sleeps the eye itself has iris with the round pupil that indicates diurnal or at least habits between the nostrils well in front of the blunt nose is wide space the nostrils are so far down to nearly touch the margin of the scales this position denotes terrestrial habits in reptiles rather than an all aquatic life to most of them water is indispensable to their welfare thus the gila monster shows this structure it likes to bathe in shallow water often many hours at time the openings of the ears are situated not far from the edge of the mouth between the head and the neck and are partly concealed and also protected by the overlapping gular fold the tympanum is exposed the animal sees and hears well the remaining three senses are more or less concentrated in the tongue which is one of the most remarkable features of the heloderma it is slightly forked at the tips half an inch wide and two to three inches long it is dark with shade of purple when in rest it is drawn togeth er into small conical shaped mass scarcely an inch in length but soon something disturbs the usual quietude of the animal the tongue is thrown out immediately in fact it is used smelling tasting feeling it is used measuring depth and distance expressing desire and satisfaction and with what rapidity is this instrument of communication projected and retracted gila monster may be trusted to some extent long the tongue is freely used but if that is not the case it is wise to be careful in handling it fear and hostility are expressed by deep hisses by opening the mouth to its fullest extent and by quick jerks of the head from one side to the other at the present time these reptiles are not so very common superstition among the ignorant and exaggerated bad reputation have brought on relentless war of extermination against them so that now in the neighborhood of settlements they are seen seldom if ever their center of distribution is more and more conﬁned to the region along the banks of the gila river in arizona although less frequently they may still be found far west the mojave desert in california but those are wrong who believe that the heloderma is living only in the most arid portions of the southwest there are several reasons why the reptile seeks eagerly irrigated places which are productive of some vegetation it needs water food and shady in the middle of summer when even the larger streams are dried up the gila monster retires to some burrow abandoned by another animal or to deep crevices in the rocks and spends there in torpid state several weeks until the great rainfalls relieve the country give fresh plant life and ﬁll again the barren riverbeds this is the animal s summer retreat during the course of year it takes second and longer one the regular hibernation that lasts about from november to the middle of february when it resumes its outside life again it loves to bask in the still mild rays of the sun but soon the heat increases the gila monster seeks shelter the day behind stones and bowlders under clumps of cacti and in small mesq uite groves along the river banks it roams about only after sunset or early in the morning the idea that this lizard enjoys the quivering heat on an open arizona plain while other sun and loving reptiles keep in hiding is erroneous many others nothing is so absolutely fatal to the heloderma to be exposed only half an hour to the direct rays of the sun in midsummer anoth er reason why it prefers to live in the neighborhood of streams where plant life is more abundant explains itself by the necessity to provide food whoever has an opportunity to observe reptiles in conﬁnement an extended period of time can easily draw conclusions to their mode of living in freedom captive gila monster is fed on hens eggs in summer one each week in winter one every two or three weeks it refuses every other kind of food however temptingly it may be offered such mice frogs angleworm s mealworms and the like it is more than probable that in their wild state they live on similar diet consisting then of eggs of other lizards of turtles and of birds the animal has the reputation of being destructive to the arizona quail several writers of natural history add to this diet of insects but the emba rrassed locomotion of the heloderma seems to exclude ﬂying and prey nearly all reptiles which feed on eggs climb some snakes and does the slow and clumsy gila monster they are not able to ascend high and straight trees which however are not found in these regions but they are able to climb bushes and low trees havin g somewhat leaning trunks and rough bark and it is wonderful to see how cleverly it disposes of the sharp claws and the muscular tail both in dragging itself up and in retarding an often too rapid descent the inquiry may be made how is it possible that heloderma lives on eggs alone when it can ﬁnd them only during the relatively short time of ﬁve or six months first it may be remembered that this period corresponds nearly to the active life of the animal before and after estivation the second and more important reason is its remarkable frugality the digestive organs are so constructed that they adapt themselves to fast of many

wild cherry bough and hanging nest and calls amid the apple bloom need to tell whose ﬂaming breast and ﬂuting note lead all the rest glory hef feran the pomegranate punica granatum the pomegranate is growing to height of about ﬁfteen feet and in favorable soil even high twenty feet it is probably native in persia though it is found in wild state in all the countries bordering on the mediterranean sea it is also found in china and japan and has been brought by man to all of the civilized parts of the globe where the climate is of sufﬁciently high degree of warmth to permit the ripening of its fruit this little tree is frequently cultivated not alone the beauty of its form but the beauty of its ﬂowers which under cultivation become doubled and show an increased and striking splendor in the richness of their color the etymology of its name is very interesting the word pomegranate is from two latin words pomum meaning apple and granatum meaning grained or seeded the former has reference to the shape of the fruit and the latter word to the numerous seeds contained in the pulp the technical name of the pomegranate plant is punica granatum the generic name punica is evidently from the latin word punicus meaning red and refers to the red color of the pulp or possibly also to the scarlet ﬂowers the name punicus was also used by the romans with reference to the carthaginians and signiﬁed untrustworthy or treacherous this people having such reputation with them thus the name may have been applied to this fruit which though it delights the eye is disappointing to the birds and nature volume ix number 2 https tells us that the pomegranate was extensively cultivated by the carthaginians at their home in northern africa this may have been the reason why the name punica was selected the genus by linnaeus the romans also called it pomum punicum or carthage apple that the knowledge of this tree is of great antiquity is shown in many ways it is frequently referred to in ancient sanskrit writings of time earlier than that of the christian in this languag it was called homer in the odyssey speaks of its cultivation in the gardens of the kings of phrygia and phaecia there are frequent references to it in the old testament in the directions making aaron s robe we ﬁnd the following passage upon the skirts of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue and of purple and of scarlet and again they made bells of pure gold and put the bells between the hiram in the building of solomon s house used the design of the pomegranate in the seventh chapter of the first book of kings we ﬁnd the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter and in another verse we are told that they were of brass moses spoke of the promised land land of wheat barley and vines and solomon indicates that this fruit was cultivated in his time he speaks of an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant the pomegranate is frequently represented in the ancient sculptures of the assyrians and of the egyptians the pomegranate belongs to the family of plants called lythraceae this family has about three hundred and ﬁfty species which are widely distributed but are most abundant in tropical regions especially in america in describing the tree oliver willis gives the following characteristics branches straight strong armed near the ends with spines young shoots and buds red leaves opposite or fascicled and without stipules flowers large solitary or two or three together in the axils of the leaves near the ends of the branchlets beautiful object planted pomegranate punica granatum ⅔ the color of the ﬂowers which develop on the ends of the younger branches is deep and rich scarlet or crimson many variations have been produced by growing the plants from seeds and one of these bears white ﬂowers the petals are rounded and usually crumpled the fruit which is berry about the size of an ordinary orange is when fresh usually of reddish yellow color becoming brownish in drying the rind is thick and leathery and encloses quantity of pulp which is ﬁlled with refreshing juice that is acid it is of pinkish or reddish color and encloses the numerous angular seeds probably the chief value of the plant lies in the use of the fruit relish though the rind of the fruit and the bark of the root are used in medicine the bark contains large amount of tannin and from it there is also obtained bright yellow dye which is used to produce the yellow levant morocco in regions without frost the tree is often grown ornamental birds and nature volume ix number 2 https and among the greeks and romans greek mythology shows us that long time perhaps many centuries the ancestors of the greeks knew but very little about the sea or about rivers the numerous monsters of the sea products of the imagination combined in their forms the parts of marine and land animals including man the angry waves suggested to them some creature that was wroth in the ocean depths what more likely to be found than the caver ns empty and dry the homes of the monsters with which they had peopled it their knowledge of the sea was of very slow growth it was yet divine thing in homer s time who lived just before the dawn of history their knowledge of marine life had made but little if any greater advance than their knowledge of the sea itself the people of homer make use whatever of ﬁsh we not ﬁnd word indicating that either noble or slave ate ﬁsh although the bill of fare in the homeric household is given to us with considerable fullness passing over two centuries or more to the athens of pericles time we will ﬁnd that great change has been wrought fish is now the daintiest viand that comes into the athenian market the ﬁshing industry has developed and grown to immense proportions the ﬁshmonger has taken on character which seems destined to be eternal till this day it has suffered change except that he has transferred to his wife some of the traits that once were his the task of supplying the of athens and other cities must have required large number of ﬁshermen at this time ﬁsh might almost be called the national dish hence an enormous consumption whereas the means of capture were far inferior to those of matter of fact the market was supplied from very wide area but chieﬂy from the seas to the east far along the north and south shores of the black sea the industry was ﬂourishing one particularly from these regions were salted and dried ﬁsh supplied here they were prepared in the huts of the individual ﬁsherman and were gathered up by the traders who sailed their little boats far and wide in search of trafﬁc the ﬁsh were exchanged merchandi especially earthen utensils and clothing these salted and dried ﬁsh were the staple varieties and were supplied to the market in great quantities they were the principal food of the poorer classes and were sold very cheap the hours the ﬁsh market in athens must have been time of very great interest not only to the athenian householder but to the foreigner sojourn ing within the city to preserve order and also to give all customers an equal chance to procure the rare specimens offered sale several stringent laws were enacted to govern the market among other regulations was one requiring the opening of the market to be announced by the ringing of bell apparently there was ﬁxed moment of time when this bell should be rung but the time varied little from day to day if we can believe our ancient authorities the ringing of the bell was the occasion rush pellmell to the market each seeking to obtain the ﬁrst choice strabo tells us an interesting story anent this custom on one occasion musician was performing before number of invited guests and when in the midst of composition the bell rang in moment the guests were up and away to the market all except one man who was deaf when the lyrist had ﬁnished he was very careful to thank his lone auditor his courtesy in remaining to hear him through instead of running away when the bell rang the rest did oh has the bell rung asked the deaf man and when informed that it had he too hastened to the market the greek interest in ﬁshes seems never to have gone beyond their utility an article of food the building of aquaria and never came to be the sport of the greeks although they became extravagant luxuries among the romans likewise ﬁshing never became the sport of greek gentleman unless perchance at rather late period plato excludes ﬁshing from the sports of gentleman the only sport he would have him engage in was the chase which athletic games aside was about the only outdoor sport greek gentleman seems to have indulged in instance there is mention in greek literature of horseback riding pastime yet horsemanship was an accomplishment in which every greek gentleman received special training likewise though ﬁshing was not recognized sport yet the science of angling was well understood among them by the third century and probably much earlier this we learn from beautiful poem by the alexandrian poet theocritus entitled the i will quote portion of the poem translated into prose partly because it gives us picture of some ancient professional ﬁshermen in the camp partly because it mentions all the ancient instruments of the business two ﬁshers on time two old men together lay and slept they had strow n the dry bed in their wattled cabin and there they lay against the leafy wall beside them were strewn the instruments of their toilsome hands the the rods of reed the hooks the sails bedraggled with the lines the weels the lobster pots woven of rushes the seines two oars and an old coble upon props beneath their heads was scanty matting their clothes their sailor s caps here was all their toil here all their wealth the threshold door did guard nor all these things all to them seemed superﬂuity poverty was their sentinel they had neighbor by them but ever against their narrow cabin gently ﬂoated up the long before daylight one of them awoke and aroused his companion to tell him the dream he had had i shall quote the dream it graphically describes an ancient angler busy at his task i was sleeping late amid the labors of the salt sea and truly not too we supped early if thou dost remember and did not overtax our bellies i saw myself busy on rock and there i sat and watched the ﬁshes and kept spinning the bait with the rods and one of the ﬁsh nibbled fat one in sleep dogs dream of bread and of ﬁsh dream well he was tightly hooked and the blood was running and the rod i graspe d was bent with his struggle so with both hands i strained and had birds and nature volume ix number 2 https 92tussle the monster how was i ever to land so big ﬁsh with hooks all too slim then just to remind him he was hooked i gently pricked him pricked and slackened and he did not run i took in line my toil was ended with the sight of my prize i drew up golden look you ﬁsh all plated thick with gold gently i unhooked him then i dragged him on shore with the i leave to the reader the pleasant task of comparing the ancient tackle with the modern it must be said however that the description is rather ideal the mediterranean ﬁsherman displays science in landing his game but simply throws it high and dry or breaks his tackle this fact is well attested the ancients by several vase and wall paintings portraying ﬁshermen actually at work these paintings show us that the ancient outﬁt included basket frequently with long handle and vase painting in vienna undoubtedly suggests its use the man has caught ﬁsh which he is lifting straight up out of the water at the same time he is reaching down with his basket evidently to scoop up the ﬁsh just before it leaves the water similar to the practice in before passing over the ionian sea to observe what the romans did in this ﬁeld of activity the study of ﬁshes among the greeks particularly that of aristotle should claim our attention compared with the work of the moderns aristotle s work was crude indeed estimated the ﬁrst attempts at building up science his work deserves our admiration and in view of the fact that his writings were standard nearl y two thousand years it demands our respect aristotle did his work in natural history under the patronage of king philip of macedon who drew upon the resources of the empire to provide him with rare or little known specimens from far and wide how some of his conclusions were based on insufﬁcient data and are consequently very inaccurate or even grotesque his discussion of the eel will illustrate it must not be taken fair sample of his work in general in fact it is very unusual among all the animals he says which have blood the eel is the only one which is not born of copulation or hatched from eggs the correctness of this statement is evident from the fact that eels make their appearance in marshy bodies of water and that too after all the water has been drawn off and the mud removed soon the begins to ﬁll these lakes they are not produced in dry weather not even in lakes that never become dry they live on the it is therefore plain that their origin is not due to procreation or to eggs in spite of this some people think that they are viviparous because worms have been found in the intestines of some eels which they believe are the young of the eel this opinion however is erroneous they are produced from the bowels of the earth the worms the spontaneous product of mud and turning now to the romans we ﬁnd somewhat different state of affairs but different only on the aesthetic side from scientiﬁc or industrial point of view the roman though heir to all the greek civilization and learning in this in many other lines made but slight advances fish culture never became serious occupation among the romans it was pastime one of the many directions which their senseless luxury took rather than carefully directed effort to stock ponds and rear ﬁsh food or means of nature study the immense ponds were stocked with rare ﬁsh in preference to useful varieties next to the rare species those that could be tamed were in favor qualiﬁcation of the above statements should be made probably in favor of the romans who lived during the early republican period of whom columella roman writer has the following to say in his book entitled re rustica the descendants of romulus although they were country folk took great pains in having upon their farms sort of abundance of everything which the inhabitants of the city are wont to enjoy to this end they did not rest contented with stocking with ﬁsh the ponds that had been made this purpose but in their foresight went to the extent of supplying the ponds formed by nature with the spawn of ﬁsh by this means the lakes velinus and sabitinus and likewise vulsmensis and ciminus have furnished in great abundance not only catﬁsh and goldﬁsh but also all the other varieties of ﬁsh which ﬂourish in fresh water such were the practices of the roman country folk in early times but strange it may seem in view of the extravagance of which the ﬁsh pond became the object in later times measures were taken to secure the reproduction and free development of staple food ﬁshes it is well known that the ancients had remarkable predilection ﬁsh food the principal luxury of the roman banquets consisted of ﬁsh and the poets speak of sumptuous tables spread with them exclusively in the period between the taking of carthage and the reign of vespasian this taste became perfect passion and its gratiﬁcation the senators and patricians enriched by the spoils of asia and africa incurred the most foolish expense thus licinius murena quintus hortensius and lucius philippus spent millions on their ﬁsh ponds and in stocking them with rare species lucullus was by far the most extravagant of these ﬁsh fanciers ﬁsh pond was to him very much what the yacht is to the modern millionaire it is his name that we ﬁnd so frequently in cicero s letters when he and his set come in several rebukes matter says cicero about the state if only their escape it was lucullus who had channel cut through mountain at an immense outlay of money in order to let salt water into his we are told by varro that one hirrius had an income of nearly from his roman real estate and spent the whole amount on his some of these were very elaborate they were constructed with many compartments in which they kept the different varieties the care of these ponds and the feeding of the animals required large force of trained men and assistants who we can infer learned great deal about the habits of ﬁshes their favorite food and how to propagate them but their information was never reduced to anything like birds and nature volume ix number 2 https foolish extravagance of the roman nobles produced but two results the less of which was the impoverishment of some of rome s wealthiest families the other and more unfortunate result was the destruction of the ﬁshes along the mediterranean sea probably the sole contribution to ulture resulting from all this extravagan ce was the introduction of into an artiﬁcial habitat and providing them nourishment in conclusion i will note some of the forms that were most popular among the romans either table use or the aquarium these we are indebted to mosaic discovered in pompeii they are formed they were seen by the artist in an aquarium but in the mosaic they are supposed to be seen if in the sea the varieties found are the grey mullet electric ray muraena scorpion ﬁsh crawﬁsh bass spinola red gumara nautis prawn and from another mosaic may be added the soft prawn squid and some other species whose english names i not know

native of arabia but does not explain what its native country was about the fourth century of our cinnamon found its way into turkey and asia minor where it was employed incense in church ceremonies in the sixth century trallianus recommended the still very expensive spice medicinal purposes during the tenth century the price of this article became much reduced and it was used spice principally in the preparation of ﬁsh meats in england it was used in veterinary practice although china is undoubtedly the home of the cinnamons they were apparently entirely overlooked by marco polo the eminent traveler and historian who visited the greater part of china oil of cinnamon was prepared early there are several varieties of cinnamon upon the market cassia cinnamon which is chinese variety is obtained from cinnamomum cassia the bark is quite thick and contains only small amount of volatile or ethereal oil it is of little value yet it is exported on large scale it forms the cheap cinnamon
