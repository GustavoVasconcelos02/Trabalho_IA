in cloth cover foreword there has been so much adulation lately of australia australian institutions and the australian people by writers with axes to grind and english politicians with party ends to serve that the people of the commonwealth have come to believe that they are the salt of the earth and that their country is the earth personally i am impatient of such credulity and i think it is time somebody called upon the australians to show cause why little more humility and little less arrogance were not more seemly with view to restoring an apparently lost sense of proportion to the press and public of the country i have written the following pages if in telling the truth i shame the australian this book will achieve its object should howl of indignation be provoked then will the condition of affairs be proved worse than my pen has power to depict and nothing will be left but to declare australia past redemption this is the case the prosecution valerie desmond sydney july 15

country not content with having fruit with stone s on the outside has made the unique experimen t of handing over its government to its peasantry other lands have at times fallen under the sway of the but this has always been temporary and the result of some hysterical upheaval but in australia this has not been the case the electors calmly and deliberately voted the labour party into power in april 1910 and since then two of the six ridiculous states that this country of four and millions has divided itself into have also calmly and deliberately decided by majorities to entrust their national guidance to butchers and bakers and makers that any body of people should in country where every man and woman irrespective of education wealth or social position has unintel ligible to the english visitor it certainly was unintelligible to at ﬁrst it grew more of mystery when i saw and heard several of the labour leaders then i saw and heard the liberal leaders and i longer wondered of all the products of australia the politician is the least worthy and the least competent oratory in this land is in the same embryo condition or the manufacture of scientiﬁc instruments generally speaking there is not in the public life of australia speaker who reaches to the standard of mediocrity in england or america and in speaking so is it much in the other qualiﬁcations that make politician the present prime minister fisher i heard in melbourne just before he left england knowing him to have been miner i was prepared it would be unfair to compare fisher with one of our cultured statesmen at home but put him beside another keir comparison is ludicrous i was told to wait until i heard deakin and luck would have it i did get an opportunity of hearing deakin at social function at toorak deakin was ﬂuent i say that him but to regard him an orator or even an average public speaker is ridiculous to one accustomed to the polished delivery and deep thought of our english politicians among the minor members of the london county council are many speakers who stand head and shoulders over deakin i also heard hughes tudor and that amusing gentleman king while i was in melbourne but i must admit that i was not deeply impressed the great ones of the victorian state parliament i missed which is possibly well if it bears any resemblance to the state parliament of new south wales in this deliberative assem bly i found the standard even lower than in the federal parliament i was was i fortunate not being able to hear mcgowen that gentleman was already in england upholding the honou r of new south wales by hammering rivet in girder and walking three miles along sewer 62 66 70 76 80 83 the project gutenberg ebook of the awful australian by valerie desmond https i heard holman and i heard wade and i heard edden and wood and fitzpatrick and several other funny little men whose names i can not remember holman reminded of the polytechnic young man who apes the style of the oxford union wade was lame and halting speaker whose thoughts moved slowly and whose diction was execrable edden reminded of an old gardener we had at home wood was the colonial excelsis he has the australian accent strongly developed he uses slang indiscriminately and he is bumptious and aggressive fitzpatrick struck mild man naturally trying hard to be like wood the others were colourless in point of ability it was ludicrous to think of these men contr olling the destinies of one of paltry million and people i doubt very much if holman or wade would ever be elected to the london county council or even one of the surrounding vestries if they contrived to so they would certainly never go back at the ensuing election holman and wade in the london county council would be simply overwhelmed the inherent bluster of the australian might prevent them being shamed to silence by the preponderating ability that surrounded them but it would not be many days before they were forgotten overlooked and not even accorded the dignity of an also spoke by the press to think of such politicians being in the mother of parliaments is enough to make the legislative angels weep c hapter ii the australian accent one of the strongest prejudices that one has to overcome when one visits australia is that created by the weird jargon that passes english in this country created is too mild term to apply to the process it comes positive shock and i recall with actual pain the morning i awoke the mailboat lay at fremantle breakwater and i heard this horrible patois ﬁlter through my porthole to of fend my ear the ﬁrst time strangely enough english people who have lived in the colonies any length of time grow accustomed to the pronunciation of the australian and worst of all it insinuates itself into their own language until it is really difﬁcult to ﬁnd resident of more than ten years standing in australia who does not like native the australian accent has frequently been described by travellers but none have done justice to its abominations many unobs ervant persons shuddering through three or four months experience have left australia saying that the peop le of the island continent use the dialect of the east end of london this is gross injustice to poor whitechapel neither the coster of nor the cockney of the days of dickens would be guilty of uttering the uncouth vowel sounds i have heard habitually used by all classes in australia the dialect of this country differs from those of other lands in being strongly developed among the educated people among the peasantry were its use restricted to the and the larrikin one could make excuses but this is not so judges scientists university graduate s and use the same universal australian esperanto the doctor who has attained eminence in australia and who in point of merit is probably quite up to the standard of the average provincial practitioner at home will give such words light and bright the same exaggerated vowel sound the cabman and the bootblack the barrister will not say may your honou r please but yer honour please the scientist will refer to researches there is such word my in the australian language husband yacht motor one hears everywhere but the most striking instance of vowel mispronunciation occurs in respect of the diphthong ow cow is invariably keeow brown is n town is teeown so exaggerated is the australian rendering of this sound that they actual ly accuse english people of being in error naturally the difference would strike you once said the project gutenberg ebook of the awful australian by valerie desmond https australian journalist to with superior smile you english people always say rahnd the tahn and talk about milking brahn cah i was too used to australian sufﬁciency by that time to take offence the people had ceased to offend and commenced to amuse but it is not so much the vagaries of pronunciation that hurt the ear of the visitor it is the extraordinary intonation that the australian imparts to his phrases there is such thing cultured reposeful conversation in this land everybody sings his remarks if he were reciting blank verse after the manner of an imperfect elocutionist it would be quite possible to take an ordinary australian conversation and immortalise its cadences and diapasons by means of musical notation herein the australian differs from the american the accent of the american educated and uneducated alike is abhorrent to the cultured englishman or englishwoman but it is at any rate harmonious that of the australian is full of discords and surprises his voice rises and falls with unexpected syncopations and even among the few cultured persons this country possesses seems to bear in every syllable the sign of the parvenu there is nouveau riche in culture well in material things and the accent of the cultivated australian proclaims to the world that his acquisition of learning belongs to his generation alone at home we are occasionally forced to encounter individuals whose sudden access to money is revealed by their tongues but we are spared from such unpleasant revelations when we meet the intellectuals these are products of generations in australia they are turned out while you wait with all the uncouthness of their fathers australia alone of all the countries in the world has lingual hobnails on its culture in the counties of great britain and the provinces of continental europe the possession of marked dialect denotes lowly origin the educated gentleman of yorkshire or sligo is differentiated only by very slight and not displeasing accent in fact in grea t britain the dialect is of some beneﬁt in indicating the origin of the man who uses it i have frequently found it of value in engaging servants and in dealing with the lower classes generally but in australia this abomin able pronunciation pervades the entire continent the native of perth and the native of townsville use precisely the same phrases pronounced precisely the same way gentleman and labourer alike possibly this is one of the results of the extraordinary democr acy of this democracy which makes jack good his master perhaps it is cause rather than an effect when jack ﬁnds his master speaking in the same manner he does himself and making effort to maintain his position gentleman he is not so much to be blamed thinking that he is good his in australia he probably is the australian practice of singing his remarks i can only ascribe to the inﬂuence of the chinese during my stay in melbourne i spent one evening at supper in chin ese shop in little bourke street and i was instantly struck by the resemblance between the intonation of the phrases passing between the chinese attendants and that of the conversation of the cultivated australians who accompanied but in addition to this lack of and the gross mispronunciation of common english words the australian interlards his conversation with large quantities of slang which make him frequently unintelligible to the visitor this use of slang is so common that the public memory forgets that it is slang and it ﬁnds its way into most unexpected places chief justices on their benches leading newspapers in their editorials such australia disﬁgure their utterances by jarring slang terms and phrases so commonly used to pass unnoticed by either their hearers or themselves english slang has foundation of humour there is note of whimsical comedy about the oxford under graduate practice of calling bag bagger and nobody can repress smile the ﬁrst time he hears coster call eyes or trousers but there is humour in australian slang it is drawn from the lowliest racecourse the football match and the like most of the imagery of primitive people it is lar gely metaphorical so involved to require an interpreter the project gutenberg ebook of the awful australian by valerie desmond https man chances are regarded hopeless the invariable australian comment is that he got buckley after having heard this stupid expression dozen times i became curious and set out on the task of tracing the meaning of it i ascertain ed that at the beginning of the nineteenth century three convicts escaped from party which landed at port phillip two were killed and eaten by the blacks but the third one buckley escaped death and lived on friendly terms with the aborigines to be found alive and well when melbourne was founded thirty years later the remote chance of escaping with his life which buckley secured has since been applied to all remote chances this is typical of australian slang and the visitor who desires to understand fully the patois encountered in this country needs to employ an interpreter in conclusion it is only necessary to point out that so objectionable is the australian accent that theatrical managers resolutely refuse to employ actors or actresses though few of these are possessed of what passes talent in managers prefer to import english artists of inferior merit solely because they possess the essential qualiﬁcations that australians ability to speak the english language c hapter iii australian manners governor king when in australia in that administrative capacity wrote in despatch of his instituting an orphan school it is the only step that would ensure some change in the manners of the next generation god knows this is bad enough that was in i made diligent search and that is the last evidence i could ﬁnd of hope having been entertained australian manners my observations during the last few months have convinced that the average australian simply does know the meaning of the word one thing that struck most forcibly is the despicable habit of cadging invitations to the best social functions i ﬁnd that it is quite common thing citizen who has been neglected in the case of big ball to ring up the gentleman in charge of the invitation list and remind him of the omission this willingness to humiliate oneself in order to gratify social ambition was revelation to another thing that left dumb with astonishment was the boorish behaviour of your women in the trams i have repeatedly seen an alleged lady compel man to occupy an uncomfortable seat rather than move up little to make room him glaring example of this selﬁshness came under my notice only the other day bejewelled female sat on an outside seat with about foot of spare space on either side of her man got in and jambed himself between her and the end of the seat the man on the other side of her moved up to allow the society dame to shift along but not she she just stuck there and ignored her unfortunate fellow passenger altogether it would be difﬁcult to ﬁnd any country in the older and more cultured world in which the common decencies of civilisation would be so completely ignored nobody ever considers the convenience of others people in the streets of every civilised portion of the say every other civilised portion of the on the side of the footpath if one of them happens to be eccentric or possessed of the instinct or overcome by any cause and obstructs the trafﬁc by walking on the wrong side he is promptly checked by authority in the guise of policeman but in the streets of sydney there is such law and order the public wander over the footpaths like with the same directing intelligence the result is that the project gutenberg ebook of the awful australian by valerie desmond https there being two clearly deﬁned streams of trafﬁc on each footpath there is struggling chaotic mass under intelligent discipline and with people possessed of decent manners the immense london crowds that ﬁll the streets around the bank and the exchange and the mansion house ﬂow to and fro to their destinations like trains in railway yard but in sydney where only comparatively handful of peopl ﬁll the streets all is confusion there being rule of the path there is order there being manners there is mutual courtesy to ease the position there being chivalry the women get hustled and the elderly and weak bumped and injured the police never interfere until somebody is assaulted and may be expected with chao tic trafﬁc regulation and people this is not an infrequent occurrence but the moment the offender has been dragged off the police retire to their places by verandah post and the same old rabble again ﬁlls the footp aths considering that the police not control the vehicles it is scarcely surprising that they permit the pedestrians to wander where they will carts and horses take any course they like one never hears of anybo dy being prosecuted driving on the wrong side of sydney street london policem an could not believe his eyes were he suddenly transported into an australian city at busy hour of the day an example in chaos and the government provides the public with tramway system the tramcars not run on the wrong side of the road i say that them but they commit every other offence against civic management that it is possible to think of it would be difﬁcult to ﬁnd any tramways in the world in which the passengers are treated less considerately the old motto of boss tweed the tammany leader was the public be damned and the government of new south wales seems to have adopted it its tramway department may be expected accidents are frequent it is scarcely possible anybody who has not visited australia to picture what this badly managed tramway service run by ofﬁcials and carry ing about double the number of passengers an old time must have been reﬁned assemblage compared with sydney tramcar the bad manners of the people are manifest in other places besides the trams and trains and ferries it is impossible to ﬁnd woman who will stand aside to let others in or out of passage way one of the most common experiences is to ﬁnd two or more women standing in front of the turnstile to talk while 50 or 100 persons miss the ferry the same thing occurs at the doors of all the elevators in places of business and at the railway wickets on the tramways men and women alike rush the doors the moment car stops utterly careless of the passengers who wish to alight in the restaurants customers place parcels umbrellas even hats on the tables whether other customers have any elbow room or room their plates does trouble them one jot nobody ever apologises in australia one gets used to that after one toes have begun to get callous from frequent treading on by strange feet one dress may be spoilt by passing painter or by fellow dancer at ball overturning cup of cof fee but one never hears an expression of regret the culmination of australian bad manners was probably reached when the new year of 1908 was ushered in australia on new year eve follows the silly practice of hanging about the streets of the city generally doing nothing but this time it did something it let off ﬁreworks it blew horns and otherwise made fool of itself and eventually growing tired of making fool of itself it proceeded to make hog of itself the women i understand were much to blame the men at the outset what followed can not be related but the saturnalia of ancient rome the bal des quartz arts and the worst of the orgies of seventeenth century rural england all found excellent imitations in the streets of sydney that night c hapter iv miss the project gutenberg ebook of the awful australian by valerie desmond https goes by comparison if i were unacquainted with england america france germany and italy i might share the delusion cherished by most australian your women are beautiful but having seen the rose how can i be content with the dandelion in accepting the praise of miss lily brayton your women should remember that this popular actress had royal time in australia and probably was not unmindful of the possibilities of return visit i am not disgruntled actress who has found australian audiences unappreciative of my talent i am merely woman the faculty of being able to see things they really are when i say that the women to be seen in the streets of sydney melbourne adelaide and hobart are unattractive i am merely stating the truth it appeals to someone with surprising lack of an extra large share of wrote of the stately carriage of australia matrons and daughters in my travels in this country the number of women encountered who knew how to walk might be counted on the ﬁngers of one hand i have seen more grace among the factory girls of poplar among the midinettes of the latin quarter and among petticoated toughs of the bowery than it has been my fortune to meet in or on the melbourne block australian women walk those who waddle with an unnatural movement of the hips like drake expressing his satisfaction with an extra fat frog affect ridiculous mincing gait that resembles nothing so much the painful perambulation of youngster who takes off his boots on hard pebbly road the ﬁrst time the best ﬁgure i have seen in australia was that of young girl of about she was beautifully moulded with bust to inspire poet and hips of exquisite roundness generally speaking melbourne women are more favoured in this respect than their sydney sisters here due possibly to bust development is abnormal while the hips have ﬂat appearance one sydney woman with rounded hips was introduced to at tea at the australia she was so well formed that i could resist the temptation of testing her genuinenes s with hatpin i say that she was i only assert that she took half an inch of steel without ﬂinching the best complexions in the common wealth are seen at hobart and fact there seems to be really pretty skins at any other places your women paint and powder too much the spectacle of young girls of 17 and 18 with rouged cheeks and carmine lips is an absurdity in country that believes that its women are beautiful the new short skirt about to be tried in paris will never become legs could not be held up to ridicule in that way it is noteworthy that while in other countries the girl with pretty ankle and shapely calf is not unconscious of her charms the australian woman is always careful to adjust her skirt on seating herself in tram or train why because she regards it immodest to show her legs the display on the surf beaches disposes of that idea the answer is found in the fact that generally speaking australian legs are better hidden from view they are either thick and stocky at the ankles with heap of ﬂesh above or are thin almost to the vanish ing point one misses the ankles and the graceful tapering calves that peep from beneath petticoats in the avenue and i was amused while at the hotel australia one afternoon last week to notice that one lady who had evidently studied my ﬁrst article in the sydney sun was endeavouring to prove that local legs are worth viewing her dress had been carefully adjusted so to provide generous display of stocking reaching nearly to the knee like so many people in young country where the polish and reﬁnement that comes from association with countries in which culture is much more asset is lacking she failed to recognise the border line that separates easy naturalness from sheer vulgarity woman who pulls up her dress deliberately in order to show her legs is pitifully immodest the woman who with malice aforethought shows her legs is vulgar and the woman who takes all sorts of trouble to hide them is prude but the woman who allows them to be viewed if the position in which she is seated permits their display is unaffected the project gutenberg ebook of the awful australian by valerie desmond https in the society in which i moved in england france and america both the women and the men are frankly natural here there is on the one hand restraint that is ludicrous and on the other hand familiarity that is indelicate norman clever work i admired long before i came to this supersensitive done service in subscribing himself the man who has seen more of the australian girl than any of his envious countrymen if his knowledge is so extensive and he is the true artist that we all believe him to be it follows that his drawing must reﬂect the local type and what we grace and beauty over which so many of your frenzied correspondents have rhapsodised not on your life the norman lindsay girl is hardly girl at all with the calves of footballer and the upper limbs of sandow she is fearful and wonderful example of the female form divine the faces of lindsay women remind more than anything else of the religious pictures of my youth designed to represent the torments of hell and to frighten people into the narrow way your foremost admires the beauty of strength well draught horse with whiskers half way up its legs is beautiful thing to draw heavy load of turnips or road metal but one would think of comparing its ungainly proportions with the symmetrical form of the thoroughbred racer if australia is trying to breed race of amazons well and are getting along very nicely but if you are anxious to match your girls with the comelier women of other have perfectly clean palette my old friend charles dana gibson would put it people who read their history closely are familiar with the evolutionary phase s through which most young countries pass here is ﬁrst the halting apologetic stage represented in the case of australia by its subservience to england and everything english nothing could be any good that was not imported the next stage was reached when you began to produce handful of clever men and women whose success in science music art and sport laid the foundations of belief that gradually developed into arrogant headedness if australia could produce brennan melba mackennal trumper an arnst and gray why should there be any limit to the fertility of its soil the idea tickled your vanity and you allowed it to grow recklessly people who came from other countries saw your weakness recognised it an inevitable phase in your progress towards national sobriety and staidness and said nice things about you it made the visitors stay more pleasant and you will in time grow out of your folly it helped rather than impeded your development have you ever noticed puppy let off the chain after being tied up long time he will jump and frisk though jumping and frisking were the things he was born and every time you pat him he bounds little higher he begins to feel tired his becomes less vigorous and eventually he sits down quietly and wonders why he was silly enough to exert himself so needlessly he notices too that the other dog who watched him with amused tolerance is quite such mongrel he seemed to be when he gambolled round him in fact on closer inspection he is recognised being bigger and possessing shinier coat than his chastened observer the puppy has learned wisdom but that pawing and prancing and hind leg foolishness were necessary part of his education and every human caress helped him along australia is not yet through the cavorting stage but it will grow out of it in time just other countries have done if i were an altruist instead of an impartial observer whose tongue and pen are always guided by clear vision and ripened judgment i would i suppose have helped on the evolutio nary process by feeding your vanity with the tablespoonsful doses administered by other visitors i know i have made myself very unpopular because i wrote the truth it appealed to but we all ca take liberties with our consciences even to please the women of australia i have been in this country several months so that i have had plenty of opportunity of judging the external excellencies of my southern sisters the diagrams which i have prepared may help my critics to understand

it was nothing unusual at the grand prix meeting at longchamps count pielliet party was similarly noteworthy the same thing might be said of the late viscount avonmore famous gathering of 1907 in which i shared with lady marjorie warshane the honor of being the ﬁnest ﬁgured woman on the lawn who is valerie desmond that she should dare criticise the myriad venuses of australia what does she

such wretched defects in people so complete in this confessional clamour this lack of combating power of pride of race ostensibly it is to exclude inferiors but it really argues against the incoming

themselves through the interstices of family cupboard doors it was at the beck of lord beauchamp who is an australian he duly qualiﬁed such by making gene ral australian of himself when governor of

henry lawson that he sent the slur frien d of mine however has seen the birthstains message in his handwriting and furthermore knows where it now is but sydney society obligingly pushed the heads back inside the cupboards and tried to marry their daughters to the australian who had caused their ancestors to feel restive to the point of obtrusiveness he became more and more australian lord beauchamp made delicate concession to society snobbery he issued blue and white tickets when he entertained it was nice differentiation of the status of his guests functions they were called but the recipients of both blue and white went all the disturbing elements and the matrons still pursued lord beauchamp with their daughters eventually they ran him out of the country is usual with australians once he went to england little more was heard of him he married there of course was cabled and australian snob papers have since had domestic details including the birth and christening whenever i have felt

bad form and he may not even know his friends of adversity fortune makes him acquainted with his own whom he is most affable if he would keep silent and let his money the talking his daughters would be less ﬁdgety it must be an awful thing to try to regulate one behaviour by book on etiquette and but his bound and hide the torture of the rich australian with family would be worse than vivisection but he has bound and hide god is good to him but the family take the altered circumstances seriously they become ﬁnickety on the matter of social distinctions had their father kept shop they cease to

hapter vii the australian at shirk the masterly inactivity of the australian is something to marvel at he is of course very tired but how he manages to get along without doing any kind of work from early morn to dewy eve throughout the circle of the golden year i must confess knocks kite high it not that he dislikes work he is really very fond of the abstract this is borne out by an account of sydney business methods published in an evening paper of that city in the form of an extra ct from commercial traveller diary it is most illustrative monda to see beeswax of the ﬁrm of beeswax and

suppose i shall sell much saddlers ironmongery just while australia is such busy place the only thing i doubt about this is the persistence of the commercial traveller i have seen good deal of that ﬂamboyant person in my travels of australia and the conclusion i formed of him was that he was not out to business so much to circulate the latest risque story criticise the management of railways and hotels explain the european situation and generally to make the rustic gape and feel discontented he is the great australian bounder every australian who is in the civil service aspires to be business man art and matters of temperament are side lines so to speak primarily it is the business faculty that is developed in all of australian life it is generally ofﬁce boy that start is made the position of ofﬁce boy means that young australia is paid ten shillings per week to look through the situations vacant column in his employer paper every morning and apply all positions advertised at 15s per week by other ﬁrms said applications to be written on his employer notepaper if he does get another place quickly he knows he be sacked nobody keeps an ofﬁce boy in australia more than week indeed his

posting at night at this work he will become acquainted with theatrical manager and will abandon it to go on with the populace in melodrama until he gets job working lift he is by this time fully qualiﬁed clerk at the age of twenty he applies admission to the police force all australians that apparently under the belief that it the only position that will enable them to keep out of gaol at the australian thinks it about time he ﬁxed on some occupation i have had large and varied experience he now writes when applying billet it is immaterial to him what appointments are offering he answers the lot he will manage station or or take private secretaryship to minister of the crown or test eyesight an optician he does mind taking the message to he he likes it to be by way of racehorse however when he ﬁxed up in an occupation he thinks will suit him the australian gets the sack his employer ﬁnds him absolutely useless he has not the habit of industry and he is incapable of sustained effort of any kind ask him if he is in produce ﬁrm the price of butter quoted in that morning paper and he wo know but he can give you the betting card at tatt without hesitation he is indifferent to everything connected with the business of his employer he knows that if the worse comes to the worse he can sleep out australians who think of going to another country with the idea of making

notiﬁed by the superintendent at albury that sensational robbery has occurred at tumberumba in new south wales and that something betwee n and worth of gold dust and retorted gold had been stolen from the local police station and from the same paper the same week while the const able slept at an early hour this morning the house of constable constable attached to redfern station was broke n into the constable had gone on duty at an early hour in the morning and about 3 in the afternoon went to bed in his residence at the other members of his family having gone out everything was properly secured and it did not enter the constable head that anyone would have the hardihood to break into his premises some time between 4 and 5 he got up and went downstairs and was astonished to ﬁnd that the house had been broken into and robbed while he slept entrance had been effected by the kitchen window the woodwork of which had been smashed the australian criminal is the most clumsy scoundrel in creation he leaves enough clues behind him jury to get to work on right away but unless he happens to leave his name and address cracksman working on fair sized crib is never caught most murderers with the exception of those who gave themselves up are at large in australia this last remark does not refer to cases of murder followed by the suicid of the perpetrator list of the undetected crimes of australia would cost too much to print c hapter ix the australian p arasitical tendencies the australian is born loafer go you north south east or west in his mortgaged land and in proportion to the distance you travel so does this truth broaden upon truth of his loaﬁng propensities he is also parasite the big australian parasite feeds smaller parasites and so ad inﬁnitum nationally the australian has been borrower by choice he is the spendthrift well who is always drain on the old man purse he has from the start been getting remittances from john bull in the guise of loans which like micawber he redeems by more the project gutenberg ebook of the awful australian by valerie desmond https has the borrowing habit bad the result if the australian wants to develop something mine say he makes bee line to the member of parliament the district and through his pernicious ofﬁce enough is squeezed out of the governm ent to sustain him until he can hawk what he has round london he seldom has any money himself and when he has he prefers not to risk it the role of promoter suits him best he gets his proﬁts out of his ﬂotation and impudently stands in with the often not this latter trick is to give verisimilitude to his bona ﬁdes his name is associated with the untamed feline on the london market just now his private ideas about ﬁnance are reﬂected in public accounts particularly in the states that have local government or irrigation boards sufﬁcient is it here to indicate his trend and point the baneful antithesis of exalting to the country there is said to be honour among thieves and on the prima facie case thus made out i can not bring myself to call the australian business man thief americans have term despised class of their community suckers they call those who comprise it in its worst sense the term ﬁts the australian wherever some sporadic energy is exhibited there you ﬁnd the suckers the sucker is chieﬂy found in big cities built on borrowed money and by boom swindles thither ﬂock all who have foresworn honest toil and the disinclination to work has been already observed is innate of the australian the sucker fastens on industry wherever it is to be found and if district threatens to thrive big town full of suckers arises to drain the proﬁts and thus is the producer who in australia economically is the count ry impoverished he and the primary industries never get chance things are foisted upon him that he does not want and is not in position to pay and he ca move without giving some sucker commission the commission is generally doing something which if he had any sense which he has the producer could himself so it happens that cities and towns are over populated by suckers who buy drinks the producer with the latter money and ditto him who purchases what has been produced drinks again at the producer expense and all this the reprehensible politician merely calls centralisation if he were less reprehensible he would acquaint himself with the state of things and then set about remedying them the ﬁgures would astound statesman think of it the population of the commonwealth was last census and 47 towns absorbed of the number the increase per cent of the population further was only while the cities are continuously absorbing the rural dwellers debts remarks coghlan have grown at much more rapid pace than population statistical account of australia the sucker curse is daily becoming more acute in australia it so happens that the young australian whose father is trying to make farmer of him registers resolution that he will be sucker with justiﬁcation doubt he regards his father fool all australians regard their fathers fools the son starts his sucking therefore commission agent and goes on the election committee of the surplus australian politician standing in the country interest and whose watchword is settle the people on the land the sucker certainly does his best to settle the people on the land but not in the sense that the humourless politician utters the the project gutenberg ebook of the awful australian by valerie desmond https hapter the australian lack of patriotism it so happens that the australian could even if he wanted to say this is my own my native land that is of course with any degree of truth the australian has long since put the country in pawn instead of evincing any lofty sentiment however the australian is generally to be heard cursing his country and good number of him get away from it the ﬁrst opportunity the good god gives them and small wonder it is land of burlesque it is built on entirely wrong principles the mountains are all round the coast and they keep the rain from going inside the consequence is that there is always drought in the interi or which same remark applies also to the australian himself it good place to live out of says the ignominious australian if you ask him anything about it in his dunderheadedness he ca see that he has fenced out enterprise and is fast legislating himself out of the country the emigration ﬁgures of australia represent those of the inhabitants who can scrape couple of hundred pounds together in order to escape the national debt the suckers and the reprehensible politician when it was proposed that australia should borrow the money in england to give england dreadnought one of the state premiers was interviewed on the subject he sounded the depths in patriotic sentiment by remarking it would be good advertisement it is only in alfred deakin peroration or that of some other silver that you hear of australian patriotism silver tongue by the way is mere euphemism there is more direct and much shorter saxon synonym if australia were great country it would have the natural corollary great man but it has never produced one sir henry parkes once proposed to erect mausoleum the illustrious dead of australia but the hopelessness of getting eligible corpses caused the idea to be abandoned there are however in australia many unexplained monuments among the latest was one in brisbane raised to deceased rugby football player will the australian ever get any sort of sense of proportion but people i suppose must ﬁrst of all have love of country before it gets standard of measurement if plebiscite were taken it would be found that the memory of edward kelly is far more revered by the citizens of this mean country than that of any other citizen this national hero was famil iarly known ned kelly after series of misunderstandings with the police he died suddenly one morning the individual australian be it here remarked does not consider the collective australian much class and the australian who has travelled has sneaking disregard his compatriots if he has spent two months in london he returns an ape englishm an so far loose clothes and cheap mannerisms will carry him he is londoner it is noticeable fact that he imitates the most inane of insular types the more howling the particular london ass of the period the more sincere the australian ﬂattery of him this needs comment and when this idiot returns to australia some gushing australian will say to oh absent printer forget the hyphen i can tell you an englishman you so dif ferent from the australian at this mr absent will smile smugly conscious of the higher the project gutenberg ebook of the awful australian by valerie desmond https he will commend her her discernment in words i was born out he will say but you know have lived in she just dotes on englishmen she likes the way they turn their trousers up at the bottoms then they start he will agree with her in sweeping depreciation of australia and all who live in it and he will tell her what jolly country england is she will sigh sympathetically to the cad instead of calling in the emptier to him it would be more patriotic extreme now how could this kind of woman kindle the spark of patriotism in her children assuming the moment that she was prepared to bear them how could she instil love of country she has passion things australian her mother never adopted the country start she was one of those wistful creatures who called old england home and her children learnt it right enough and these australian women are now lending voice in the country affairs the word voice is used deliberately it is about the only thing the australian will lend the country c hapter xi club life in australia i been assured by fellow countrymen exiled in this land that if you take an australian into your club he put his hand in his pocket and ask you what you will have to drink that of course is just little demonstration meaning that he feels perfectly at home the australian clubs take on all sorts of names but the same atmosphere pervades the lot in some clubs are men who have been members years who could tell you where the was they only know the way to the bar but to return to the atmosphere of australian clubs i am assured by friends that it is engendered of rank and common suspicion that one member is going to endeavour to borrow money from another one feels the constraint in the air at once and one gets jolly and hilarious in consequence but just cunning drunk man ca escape the borrower in he gauges the standing of club by the magnitude of the loan member suggests visitor to an australian club can never be sure to whom he is going to meet if tailor happens to be in fair way of business he probably makes the members of some club feel uncomfortable every time glass door swings open pinero said something derogatory about solicitors in clubs they in all australian clubs i have heard of solicitor taking revenge out of an australian who had been dodging service of writ issued from the said solicitor ofﬁce weeks but the australian guessed the boy with the writ was on the pavement and evaded the solicitor stare by putting comic paper between him and it one also meets the dentist in most australian clubs some of the developments of the literary club are peculiar to australia example on the selection committee of the johnsonian club brisbane is man whose greatest literary effort was the announcement to gasping audience that there were cases set down hearing at the police court this morning in the same club are many who could not tell you who boswell was any more than some members of the melbourne yorick could tell you what hamlet killed behind the arras if you asked after midnight the most literary of them they would one voice say mouse the project gutenberg ebook of the awful australian by valerie desmond https have been at some loss to know what makes person eligible membership at one of the many australian city clubs but enquiry has brought to light some pilling episodes i have known father pilled membership of club and his son go through all right but the father had educated the son up snob he dressed better than his governor and sponged on him i have often wondered if the old chap knew what compliment the members of the club paid him in deciding he was not ﬁt to associate with his son the languid swell element has invade d all australian clubs publicans sons most congregate in them when people who work living are out after crust these youths take mental exercise reading the theatrical gossip and social columns of the weekly snob papers they are walking encyclopædias of useless information and may be trusted to make fools of themselves on all occasions they experience great joy in pointing out to foolish little girls in the street man in the public eye honorary member of our club probably an imported actor however is blissfully unaware of his advertiser existence these australian clubs metaphorically tumble over each other to have distinguished visitor to toady to and to get little of the reﬂected glory they will sign chits his drinks till all blue if he happens to be sufﬁciently hoggish to keep pace with them in the absence of any intellectual powers the australian clubman idea of thoroughly entertaining guest is to get drunk with him to put man to his boots off and all the height of his hospitality some australians in their cups will wax reminiscent on the days when the nights we used to have at the old bandicoot club there is an expression in australia blind bandicoot it at variance with natural history but most sayings

they are not representative of the class class squatters are illiterate and an exempliﬁcation of the poet mock logic that the man who drives fat cattle must himself be fat about the head they are used chieﬂy members of the different legislative councils where they obstruct liberal land laws with much vehemence and bad gramma they are in the main responsible the slow settlement of australian

australians complain that it is unfair to judge the country indebtedness on population basis they should remember that this sort of thing debars immigration it rather accentuates the borrowing plight

he opens bazaar he prefers however eating at complimentary banquets tendered to anybody whose fellow townsmen think justiﬁes gor ge the prodigality with which the people responsible hand out titles to australians is doubt part of the scheme which sprang from the mind of william charles wentworth the originator in the country of that fatal drollery called representative government wentworth was known the shepherd king titular craze again there was also in australia bushranger king hall who was shot by policeman was so titled by the new south wales premier of the times hon afterwards of course sir john robertson hall owned station but to return to wentworth scheme it was to found colonial aristocracy house of replica of england rather than america martin in his australia and the empire chronicles the folly the subje ct he wrote had been years maturing in his wentworth mind he even expounded his views on this question of an australian house of lords in gotten article in the pages of an english magazine yet on this point of creating brand new colonial aristocracy he failed miserably the commonest street orator in sydney could raise ready laugh by giving list of the expectant nobility robert lowe opposed it in the house of commons and his criticism had all the weight of colonial experience while young sydney tradesman by name henry parkes lang described the premier of new south wales ﬁrst rose to public notoriety and favour by his diatribes against this feature of wentworth great measure the young sydney tradesman afterwards drew knighthood himself and

government house entree and rating at functions where there is recourse to precedence wives and daughters thus get their hands on the social lever and so later on catch with great adroitness the

hapter xiv the australian at the breakf ast table from close observation of australian restaurants i have come to the conclusion that the australian does not eat his wolfs it he not very particular either what he eats in queensland earth is in his dieting scale what he chieﬂy wants is something to chew and he usually bites of f more than he comfortably can he argumentative at the breakfast table and the less he knows about subject the more he say one of him wanted to argue with only the other morning on this very subject of eating the argument turned on the word dinner and he let his porridge get cold while he went dictionary to dine he said with his mouth full is to dinner and according to this dictionary that is chief meal of the day that just australian regulates it by size he can not distinguish between meal and dinner delicate glass spotless napery ﬂowers and above all sparkling larger delights does not encourage he is mere gross feeder i am talking now of the man who can afford these things even the employment of conve rsationalist not of the sixpenny dining rooms of which australia is the home how horrible these dining rooms are on hot day you can smell them two streets off if you are brave enough to look in you will see what you usually go to the zoo at 4 to watch there is restaurant in australia where you can get meal suited to the clima and home meals well if an australian asks you to his house to dine go unless you an ostrich cooking among australian women is lost art the australian girl goes in accomplishments only if she is ever called upon to cook anything she uses the frypan if i ever set up business in australia it would be in three lines pans false teeth and patent medicines everything is washed down in australia with tea it is dangerous beverage it is made there in witness thereof are the clayey complexions and dyspeptic noses of the women why they drink wine the natural beverage of the country i never could make out until i tasted the vintages but they are improving some foreigners are making very decent wine in australia just now but the australians wo drink it until it is exported and returns again to the country with french brand on it the same remark applies to most things in australia they manufacture anything i once dined with squatter in queensland and there was not an article of furniture in the room that had been made in australia and not thing on the table except the vegetables but was imported the table linen the glassware the knives the were imported the wine was imported so was the salmon and the coffee and his missus cat was manx and yet there was thing in the room but the raw material could have been produced in the country right down to the the project gutenberg ebook of the awful australian by

federal electoral rolls he said however that it was all right there are just about many people anxious to make the poetry of the count ry there are to make its laws and among them all they have made mess of both parkes addressing public meeting once said i would rather be poet than politician somebody interjected well are you i thank god when i think of the few awful hours i spent with the australian muse or more correctly speaking bemuse that i have read very little australian poetry nevertheless i have read enough to enable to arrive at deﬁnition of what really constitutes right to be called poet and it is any person of either sex who can write in metre without being laughed at in applying this golden rule it will be seen that there are poets in australia except the alleged humorous versiﬁers sir henry parkes deceased is generally referred to in the australian press poet politician and patriot i have the time to inquire into all the other things but i did spend an hour with his fragmentary though ts and stolen moments they are well worth perusing and i think everybody ought to read those sympathetic lines to beautiful and friendless child aged four years the child was aged four years it is not an early poem which fact i thought it just well to mention before quoting the opening stanza did shock of slay thy mother how from all kindred torn than god eye what

begins in mental agony he lifted up his voice to him who hears the suf ferer prayer that just what you feel like doing the spirit of humility expressed in the poem is in sharp contrast to the ferocity expressed by brother bard who on leaving australia shores shook his clenched ﬁst at the continent and recited some lines the rich man heaven the poor man hell land of fare thee well there has been lot of controversy in the commonwealth to the missing word so i leave it blank and pass on to the ode that won the new south wales government prize of ﬁfty guineas in open competition being the best

https that was addressed to the australian the purpose of arousing him what chance had it of doing so the australian mere ly turned over and said why the blanky blank should i get up it just well that all should know here and now that the only way to waken australia is to heave brick at i doing one of the best known poets of australia i understand is the rev cuzens who published volume entitled footprints of jesus i make bold to reprint verse of the temptation dreary wilderness desert wild of nature varied loveliness despoiled stretched out i see in barrenness and woe ﬁtting emblem of the world below deep gloom and dread the land i can not say of what denomination the rev poet was but i understand it was written before the days of the salvation army commenced to enrich the world library of hymns there was also poet named kendall of whom australia is very proud the press critics call him an impulsive songster and i remember taking little thing of his away in memory after reading collection of his verse the little thing went there is river in the hills i long to think about perhaps the searching feet of man have never found it out it suggested to at the time mary had little lamb uneven in the feet kendall was accused of purloining from tennyson and he w can not pass through the woods without taking away the smell of violets but that was the charge it was that he dug the violets up by the roots and transplanted them in his own pages but kendall has gone he has also his rewar i saw painting of him in the hall of sydney sporting hotel when i was staying there what more can poet ask in australia brunton stephens though he wrote in australia received his impression and education in the old world he did not adopt australia till he was 31 years of age and man gathers few new impressions after thirty he lives in and writes of those of youth thus strictly speaking stephens was not an australian poet yet he was the only man in the country who ever wrote with philosophic outlook and knowledge of prosody he was not an admirer of australian poetry either it lacks fundamental basis of brain was his verdict poor stephens stephens the stickler the precise word the admirer of literary is what he got at the hands of an australian bard who wrote critical biography of him on the literary page of the national newspaper mine are the italics and parenthetical remarks he was the youngest of family of brothers and three sisters stephens once taught mathematics fielding smollett shakespeare and the english classics were more to the boy taste than athletics what nationality were f and at 1 1 his father died the position was secured him through the inﬂuence of fellow student named simpson whose father later on became the discoverer of chloroform an and knight intrepid simpson father they the leylands literally rolled in riches the project gutenberg ebook of the awful australian by valerie desmond https within week he delivered lecture on antiquities of egypt in the brisbane school of arts again men of stephens temperament too often have made mistakes in marryi is sufﬁcient to say that stephens married the predestined woman matter of fact stephens was most happily married i merely mention these things to show how they treat poet in australia the rest the australian poets are pessimists alleged funny writers and parodists of swinburne and kipling paterson writings smell of horse sweat and stable sweepings lawson sings of colonial dear english reader god spare you from ever retails the philosophy of that blasphemous old reprobate omar with this pewter of colonial beer not jug of wine and then there are gordon and sladen john cash neild furtell and farrell the last mentioned wrote poem how he died i never read it and want to so ca say how he died but if it was an australian poet who was dying i know how he ought to have been killed in the pleasant metaphor of his own country he should have got it where the chicken got the axe c hapter xvi the this title which attaches to all australians during period of superﬁcial precocity has great local signiﬁcance it means clever young australian and it originate d in the newspapers where the phrases are the same yesterday and ever instance australian editor would let the name of chatterton pass without adding wonderful boy is therefore newspaper degree it is conferred most with rather less discrimination than ally sloper award of junior reporters mothers just yearn it and the local newspaper is obliging an australian mother tells her daughters to be let who will be good the result is much cultivated pianists and thin voices taught to sing tosti goodbye the inevitable subscription concert to raise funds further futile study there is in every town in the commonwealth coming australian but none of them ever seem to any arriving someone is all the same ever getting beneﬁt of the doubt in the shape of the aforesaid subscription concert it is given out that she is going to the old world to study under marchesi or someone sufﬁciently afar to make the passage money consideration it regular conﬁdence trick sooner does the shock of the beneﬁciary awful singing blow over than she is back about town again perhaps she has realised enough by the fraud to buy piano and brass plate and she sets up teaching others to follow in her devious ways strict justice to the australian songster compels to say that few of them achieve to the position of chorus girls i heard some chorus girls of the old school complain in café one night that what with these conservatorium girls cutting the screws the profession is going to the dogs there have been some australian women who have reached london and hit that city hard armstrong that it she was not however she has outlived one of the adjectives before she went home when she was singing at shilling concerts her fellow australians had the gumption to hear anything wonderful in her notes melba recently swept through australia in way and was queen of champion grovelling the project gutenberg ebook of the awful australian by valerie desmond https crossley also found london she came back and found australia which would look at her at some years before when her notes were fuller and richer ready to pay half guinea time of its creditors money to see what her gowns were like of the many other singers who left australia shores the most have been engulfed in the city of the thames some bob up now and again when their voices are to be heard at pops but most of them would like to raise return fare and that is probably their last illusion and then of course the stage attracts the anything that looks easy and is likely to bring adulation always does but i have made exhaustive inquiry and failed to discover one actor or actress who learnt the business in australia that has turned out anything worth mentioning i have traced several to london and there given them men in pity and the women in disgust the founder of the drama in australia was barrington some idea of his ability an actor may be formed from the fact that he was ever convicted in the drama oscar asche is the only man i can ﬁnd doing fairly well but he did not learn his business in australia indeed it is part of australia ignominy to see english and american artists being imported to play any parts requiring the exercise of intelligence managers when interviewed to why they employ australians have given it reason that the australians can not pronounce english properly and that they have distorted idea of the fact is that by the time the australian gets part he is so furtive with dodging creditors that he can not get apprehension out of his face when any other character makes an entrance the artistic australian also gets to london mortimer menpes was he went from town which also produced the late guy boothby menpes in writing his biography who who stated that he was inartistically born in australia what does he mean he was before the time of incubators then guy boothby i know how he could ever have looked bookstall in the face after what he wrote his fellow australians nat gould or fergus hume either that matter between them these australians used to average four books month ﬁfteen short stories and two puff interviews by boothby with himself written up the magazines boothby found plenty of good material in himself interviews haddon chambers also gives the magazine readers glimpses of himself but of late years he seems to spend all his time in protesting that he did write the tyranny of tears
