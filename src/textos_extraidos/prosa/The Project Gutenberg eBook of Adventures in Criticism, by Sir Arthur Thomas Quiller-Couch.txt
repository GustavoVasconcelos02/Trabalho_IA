march 17 professor skeat chaucer after years of close toil professor skeat has completed his great edition of chaucer it is obviously easier to be dithyrambic than critical in chronicling this event to which indeed dithyrambs are more appropriate than criticism when man writes opus vitæ meæ at the conclusion of such task this and so lays down his pen he must be churl even if he be also competent critic who will allow pause admiration and where churl or churl is the competent critic to be found the professor has here compiled an entirely new text of chaucer founded solely on the manuscripts and the earliest printed editions that are accessible where chaucer has translated the originals have been carefully studied the requirements of metre and grammar have been carefully considered throughout and the phonology and spelling of every word have receivedpg 1 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https attention we may add that all the materials life of chaucer have been sought out examined and pieced together with exemplary care all this has taken professor skeat years and in order to pass competent judgment on his conclusions the critic must follow him step by step through his will take the critic even if we are charitable enough to suppose his mental equipment equal to professor skeat another ten years at least our time then and probably many generations after this edition of chaucer will be accepted ﬁnal and the clarendon press and i seem to see in this edition of chaucer the beginning of the realization of dream which i have cherished since ﬁrst i stood within the quadrangle of the clarendo n that ﬁne combination of the factory and the palace the aspect of the press itself repeats it were the characteristics of its government which is conducted by an elected body an honorable trust its delegates are not intent only on and yet the clarendon press makes money and the university can depend upon it handsome subsidies it may well depend upon it much more the bank of which in its system of government it may be the focus of all the other banks private or in the kingdom and the not only of the nation gold but of its commercial honor so the clarendon careful in its selections and muniﬁcent in its become the academy or central temple of english literature if it would but follow up professor skeat chaucer with resolution to publish at pace suitable to so large an undertaking all the great english classics edited with all the scholarship its wealth can command i believe that before long the clarendon press would be found to be exercising an inﬂuence on english letters which is at present lacking and the lack of which drives many to call from time to time the institution in this country of something corresponding to the french academy i need only cite the examples of the royal society and the marylebone cricket club to show that to create an authority in this manner is consonant with our national practice we should have that centre of correct information correct judgment correct intellectual metropolis in is the surest check upon provinciality in literature we should have standard of english scholarship and an authoritative dictionary of the english language and at the same time we should escape all that business of the green coat and palm branches which has at times exposed the french academy to much vulgar intrigue also i may add we should have the books where now is the great edition of bunyan of defoe of gibbon the oxford press did once publish an edition of gibbon worthy enough far type and paper could make it worthy but this is only to be found in why are two rival london houses now publishing editions of scott the better illustrated with silly pictures out of the artists heads where is the ﬁnal edition of ben jonson these and the rest are to come perhaps of late we have had from oxford great bos well and great chaucer and the magniﬁcent dictionary is under weigh so that it may be the dream is in process of being realized though none of us shall live to see its full realization meanwhile such work professor skeat chaucer is not only an answer to much chatter that goes up from time to time about of the work on english literature being done out of england this and similar works are the best of all possible answers to those gentlemen who so often interrupt their own chrematistic pursuits to point out in the monthly magazines the of our two great universities nurseries of chrematistic youth in this case it is oxford that publishes while cambridge supplies the learning and from natural affection i had rather it were always oxford that published attracting to her service the learning scholarship intelligence of all parts of the kingdom

they would particular harm and meanwhile in walton street out of earshot of the new schools the clarendon press would go on serenely performing its great work march 23 essentials and accidents of poetry work such professor skeat chaucer puts the critic into frame of mind that lies about midway between modesty and cowardice one what right have i who have given but very few hours of my life to the enjoying of chaucer who have never collated his mss who have taken the events of his life on trust from his biographers who am authority on his spelling his rhythms his inﬂections or the spelling rhythms inﬂections of his age who have read him only i have read other great poets the pleasure of right have i to express any opinion on work of this character with its imposing commentary its patien t research its enormous accumulation of special information nevertheless this difﬁdence i am sure may be carried too far after all is said and done we with our average life of years and ten are the heirs of all the poetry of all the ages we must our best in our allotted time and chaucer is but one of the poets he did not write specialists in his own age and his main value succeeding ages resides not in his vocabulary nor in his inﬂections nor in his indebtedness to foreign originals nor in the metrical uniformities or anomalies that may be discovered in his poems but in his poetry other things are accidental his poetry is essential other philological be recognized but the poetical or let us say the spiritual interest stands ﬁrst and far ahead of all others by virtue of it chaucer now always makes his chief and his convincing appeal to that which is spiritual in men he appeals by the poetical quality of such lines these from emilia prayer to diana chaste goddesse wel wostow that i desire to been mayden al my lyf ne never wol i be love ne wyf i am thou woost yet of thy companye mayde and love hunting and venerye and to walken in the wodes wilde and noght to been wyf and be with

κατέχεν φυσίζοος αἷα ἐν λακεδαίμονι αὖθι φίλῃ ἐν πατρίδι γαιῃ these lines live because they contain something which is also permanent in man they depend conﬁdently on us and will conﬁdently depend on our i was glad to see this point very courageously put the other day by profess or hiram corson of cornell university in an address on the aims of literary study address which macmillan have printed and published here and in america all works of genius says corson render the best service in literary education when they are ﬁrst assimilated in their absolute character it is of course important to know their relations to the several times and places in which they were produced but such knowledge is not the tyro in literary study he must ﬁrst know literature if he is constituted so to know it in its absolute character he can go into the philosophy of its relationships later if he like when he has true literary education and when the that bring the philosophic mind have been reached every great production of genius is in fact in its essential character more related to one age than to another it is only in its phenomenal character its outward manifestations that it has special relationship and mr corson very appositely quotes mr ruskin on shakespeare historical if it be said that shakespeare wrote perfect historical plays on subjects belonging to the preceding centuries i answer that they are perfect plays just because there is care about centuries in them but life which all men recognize the human life of all time and this it is not because shakespeare sought to give universal truth but because painting honestly and completely from the men about him he painted that human nature which is indeed constant rogue in the ﬁfteenth century being at heart what rogue is in the nineteenth century and was in the twelfth and an honest or knightly man being in like manner very similar to other such at any other time and the work of these great idealists is therefore always universal not because it is not portrait but because it is complete portrait down to the heart which is the same in all ages and the work of the mean idealists is not universal not because it is portrait but because it is half the outside the manners and the dress not of the heart thus tintoret and shakespeare paint both of them simply venetian and english nature they saw it in their time down to the root and it does all time but any care to cast themselves into the particular ways of thought or custom of past time in their historical work you will ﬁnd it in neither of them nor in any other perfectly great man that i know of modern painters it will be observed that corson whose address deals primarily with literary training speaks of these absolute qualities of the great masterpieces the ﬁrst object of study but his words and ruskin words fairly support my further contention that they remain the most important object of study matter how far one literary training may have proceeded to the most erudite student of chaucer in the wide world chaucer poetry should be the dominant object of interest in connection with chaucer but when the elaborate specialist confro nts us we are apt to forget that poetry is meant mankind and that its appeal is or should be universal we pay tribute to the unusual and so far this implies respect protracted industry and indefatigable learning we right but in so far it implies even momentary confusion of the essentials with the accidentals of poetry we wrong and the specialist himself continues admirable only so long he keeps them distinct i hasten to add that professor skeat does keep them distinct very successfully in single sentence of admirable brevity he tells us that of chaucer poetical excellence it ispg 9 pg 10 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https to speak lowell essay on chaucer in study windows gives just estimate of his powers and with this taking the poetical excellence granted he proceeds upon his really invaluable work of preparing standard text of chaucer and illustrating it out of the stores of his apparently inexhaustible learning the result is monument to chaucer memory such never yet was reared to english poet douglas jerrold assured cowden clarke that when her time came to enter heaven shakespeare would advance and greet her with the ﬁrst kiss of welcome even should her husband happen to be present one can hardly with decorum imagine professor skeat being kissed but chaucer assuredly will greet him with transcendent smile the professor genuine admiration however the poetical excellence of his poet needs to be insisted upon not only because the nature of his task keeps him reticent but because his extraordinary learning seems now and then to stand between him and the natural appreciation of passage it was not quite at haphazard that i chose just now the famous description of the prioresse an illustration of chaucer poetical quality the professor has long note upon the french of stratford atte bowe most of us have hitherto believed the passage to be an example and very pretty one of chaucer playfulness the professor almost loses his temper over this he speaks of it view commonly adopted by newspaper who know only this one line of chaucer and can not forbear to use it in jest even tyrwhitt and wright he adds more in sorrow than in anger have thoughtlessly given currency to this idea chaucer the professor explains merely states fact the italics are his own that the prioress spoke the usual of the english court of the english and of the english ecclesiastics of higher ranks the poet however had been himself in france and knew precisely the difference between the two dialects but he had special reason thinking more highly the professor italics again of the parisian than of the french warton note on the line is quite sane he shows that queen philip pa wrote business letters in french doubtless with propriety and so on you see there was benedictine nunnery at and cutts says very justly spoke french correctl y though with an accent which savored of the benedictine convent at where she had been educated rather than of paris so there you have fact and now you have it does it look rather like bitzer horse bitzer said thomas gradgrind y our deﬁnition of horse quadruped graminivorous forty teeth

bitzer march 30 the t exts of the canterbury t ales it follows i hope from what i said last week that by far the most important service an editor can render to chaucer and to us is to give us pure text through which the native beauty of the poetry may best shine such text professor skeat has been able to prepare in part by his own great industry in part because he has entered into the fruit of other men labors the event in the history of the canterbury tales with which alone we are concerned here was furnivall publication the chaucer society of the famous ext edition dr furnivall set to work upon this in the six texts were these the great ellesmere so called after its owner the earl of ellesmere the ﬁnest and best of all the mss now extant pg 12 pg 13 pg 14 pg the project gutenberg

best copy in any public library this also follows the ellesmere closely the corpus in the library of corpus christi college oxford the petworth belonging to lord leconﬁeld the lansdowne in the british museum not good being certainly the worst of the six but worth reprinting owing to the frequent use that has been made of it by editors in his introduction professor skeat enumerates fewer than mss of the tales but of these the above six and seventh to be mentioned presently are the most important the most important of all is the ellesmere great ﬁnd of the ext edition the best in nearly every respect says professor skeat it not only gives good lines and good sense but is also usually grammatically accurate and thoroughly well spelt the publication of it has been great boon to all chaucer students which furnivall will be ever gratefully remem bered this splendid has also the great merit of being complete requiring supplement from any other source except in few cases when line or two has been missed professor skeat has therefore chieﬂy employed the ext edition supplemented by seventh famous the harleian 7334 in full the chaucer society in of great importance differing considerably from the ellesmere but the professor judges it most dangerous to trust to unless constantly corrected by others and not at all ﬁtted to be taken the basis of text the basis of his text then he takes the ellesmere correcting it freely by the other seven mss mentioned now fate would have it in the year 1888 furnivall invited alfred pollard to collaborate with him in an edition of chaucer which he had many years promised to bring out macmillan the basis of their text of the tales was almost precisely that chosen by professor skeat careful collation of the six texts and the harleian 7334 due preponderance being given to the ellesmere and all variations from it stated in the notes beginning was made says pollard but the giant in the partnership had been used quarter of century to doing nothing all the hard work other people and could not spare from his pioneering the time necessary to enter into the fruit of his own chaucer labors thus the partner who was not giant was left to go on pretty much by himself when i had made some progress professor skeat informed us that the notes which he had been years accumulating encouraged him to undertake an edition on large scale and i gladly abandoned in favor of an editor of so much greater width of reading the library edition which had been arranged in the original agreement of furnivall and myself with macmillan i thought however that the work which i had done might fairly be used an edition on less extensive plan and intended less stalwart class of readers and of this the present issue of the canterbury tales is an instalment b so it comes about that we have two texts before us each based on collation of the text edition and the harleian chief difference being that pollard adheres closely to the ellesmere while professor skeat allows himself more freedom this is how they whán that apríllė with híse shourės soote the droghte of march hath percėd to the roote and bathed every veyne in swich licóur of which vertú engendred is

it at the end of one they are fairly puzzled in 10 the scribe of hn writes lye and that of ln writes yhe and the variations on this theme are curious the spelling ye yë is however common i print it to distinguish it from ye the pl pronoun the other differences are accounted by the varying degrees in which the two editors depend on the ellesmere pollard sticks to the ellesmere professor skeat corrects it by the others obviously the editor who allows himself the wider range lays himself open to more criticism point by point he has to justify himself in each particular case while the other excuse is set down once all in his preface but after comparing the two texts in over dozen passages i have had to vote in almost every case professor skeat the alleged difﬁculty of reading chaucer the differences however are always triﬂing the reader will allow that in each case we have clear intelligible text text that allows chaucer to be read and enjoyed without toil or vexation my part i hope there is presumption in saying that i could very well without pollard accents and dotted remove them and i contend that any englishman with an ear poetry can read either of the two texts without difﬁculty great deal too much fuss is made over the pronunciation and scansion of chau cer after all we are englishmen with an instinct understanding the language we inherit in the evolution of our language we move on the same lines our fathers and chaucer english is at least further removed from us than the lowland dialect of scott novels moreover we have in reading chaucer what we lack in reading assistance of rhythm and the rhythm of chaucer is clearly marked that of tennyson professor skeat might very well have allowed his admirable text to stand alone his rules of pronunciation with their elaborate system of signs and symbols seem to to put it coarsely phonetics gone mad this instance is how he would have us read the tales sóotə pérsed tóo dhə róotə likúur iz dhə ﬂúur pg 19 pg 20 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https so on i think it may safely be said that if man need this sort of assistance in reading or pronouncing chaucer he had better let chaucer alone altogether or read him in german prose translation april 6 why is chaucer so easy to read at ﬁrst glance page of the canterbury tales appears more formidable than page of the faërie queene matter of fact it is less formidable or if this be denied everyone will admit that twenty pages of the canterbury tales are less formidable than twenty pages of the faërie queene i might bring several recent editors and critics to testify that after the ﬁrst shock of the archaic spelling and the ﬁnal an intelligent public will soon come to terms with chaucer but the unconscious testimony of the intelligent public itself is more convincing chaucer is read year after year by large number of men and women spenser in many respects greater poet is also read but by far fewer nobody i imagine will deny this but what is the reason of it the ﬁrst and chief reason is of language change but the great art of narrative appeals eternally to men and its rules rest on principles older than homer and whatever else may be said of chaucer he is superb narrator to borrow phrase from another venerable art he is always on the ball he pursues the story and again the story ward once put this the vivacity of joyousness of chaucer poetic temperament make him amusingly impatient of epical lengths abrupt in his transitions and anxious with an anxiety usually manifested by readers rather than by writers to come to the point the great effect he is wont to call it he says overlade ship or barge and there fore i will skip at once to the effect and let all the rest slip and he unconsciously suggests striking difference between himself and the great elizabethan epic poet who owes so much to him when he declines to make long tale of the chaff or of the straw of the corn and to describe all the details of seriatim fruit of every tale is to say they eat and drink and dance and sing and play this may be the fruit but epic poets from homer downward have been generally in the habit of not neglecting the foliage spenser in particular has that impartial copiousness which we think it our duty to admire in the ionic epos but which if truth were told has prevented generations of englishmen from acquiring an intimate personal acquaintance with the queen with chaucer the danger certainly rather lay in the opposite direction now if we are once interested in story small difﬁculties of speech or spelling will not readily daunt us in the pursuit of what happens next not if we know enough of our author to feel sure he will come to the point and tell us what happens next with the least possible palaver we have deﬁnite want and certainty of being satisﬁed promptly but with spenser this satisfac tion may and almost certainly will be delayed over many pages and though in the meanwhile thousand casual beauties may appeal to us the main thread of our attention is sensibly relaxed chaucer is the minister and spenser the master and the difference between pursuing what we want and pursuing must affect the ardor of the chase even if we take the future on trust and follow spenser to the end we can not look back on book of the faërie queene on part of good story it is admitte dly an unsatisfying and story but my point is that an ordinary reader resents being asked to take the future on trust while the author luxuriates in casual beauties of speech upon every mortal subject but the one in hand the ﬁrst principle of good narra is to stick to the subject the second to carrypg 22 pg 23 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https audience along in series of small expectation and going just little beyond if it were necessary to read ﬁfty pages before enjoying chaucer though the sum of eventual enjoyment were great it now is chaucer would never be read we master small difﬁculties line by line because our recompense comes line by line moreover it is certain can be that we read chaucer more easily than our fathers read him one hundred two hundred three hundred years ago and i make haste to add that the credit of this does not belong to the philologists the elizabethans from spenser onward found chaucer distressingly archaic when sir francis kynaston temp charles translated troilus and criseyde cartwright congratulated him that he had at length made it possible to read chaucer without dictionary and from dryden time to wordsworth he was an uncouthe unkiste barbarian full of wit but only tolerable in polite paraphrase chaucer himself seems to have foreboded this towards the close of his troilus and criseyde when he addresses his litel book and there is so great diversitee in english and in wryting of our tonge so preye i god that noon miswryte thee ne thee mismetre defaute of tonge and red wher thou be

ring of it in our ears after ﬁve centuries of linguistic and metrical development to whom besides chaucer himself we owe this while chaucer has remained substantially the same apparently we have an aptitude that our grandfathers and thers had not the answer surely is we owe it to our nineteenth century poets and particularly topg 25 pg 26 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https swinburne and william morris years ago horne said most acutely that the principle of chaucer rhythm is inseparable from full and fair exercise of the genius of our language in versiﬁcation this full and fair exercise became despised almost lost tradition after chaucer death the rhythms of skelton of surrey and wyatt were produced on alien and narrower lines revived by shakespeare and the later elizabethans it fell into contempt again until cowper once more began to claim freedom english rhythm and after him coleridge and the despised leigh hunt but never has its full liberty been so triumphantly asserted by the three poets i have named above if we are at home we read chaucer it is because they have instructed us in the liberty which chaucer divined the only

shakespear at london printed jaggar d and are to be sold by leake at the greyhound in paules chur chyar this of course was disingenuous some of the numbers were by shakespeare but the authorship of some remains doubtful to this day and others the enterprising jaggard had boldly conveyed from marlowe richard barneﬁeld and bartholomew grifﬁn in short to adapt famous line upon famous lexicon the best part was shakespeare the rest was not this jaggard has been execrated from time to time with sufﬁcient heartiness swinburne in his latest volume of essays calls him an infamous pirate liar and thief humphreys remarks less vivaciously that he was not careful and prudent or he would not have attached the name of shakespeare to volume which was only partly by the was his crime had jaggard foreseen the tantrums and contradictions he caused some payne collier would doubtless have substituted william shakespeare and others william shakespeare thus he might have saved his reputation and this hornets nest which now and then rouses itself afresh around his aged ghost of three centuries ago that ghost can suffer inconvenience from hornets i take to be indisputable but defence of jaggard

misdeeds of the second edition of the passionate pilgrim copy exists nothing whatever is known of it and the whole edition may have been but an ideal construction of jaggard sportive fancy but in 1612 appeared the passionate pilgrime or certaine amor ous sonnets between venus and adonis newly corrected and augmented by shakespear the third edition wher eunto is newly added two love epistles the ﬁrst from paris to hellen and hellen answer back again to paris printed by jaggar these two love epistles were really by thomas heywood this was very quickly cancelled and shakespeare name omitted humphrey hypothesis these are the bare facts now observe how they appear when set forth by humphreys shakespeare who when the ﬁrst edition was issued was aged acted his part great man very well he with dignity took notice of the error on the of the ﬁrst edition attributing to him poems which he had never written but when jaggard went on sinning and the third edition appeared under shakespeare name solely though it had poems by thomas heywood and others well jaggard was promptly pulled up by both shakespeare and heywood upon this the publisher appears very properly to have printed new omitting the name of shakespeare upon this i beg leave to 1 that although it may very likely have been at shakespeare own request that his name was removed from the of the third edition humphreys has right to state this an ascertained fact 2 that i fail to understand if shakespeare acted properly in case of the third edition why we should talk nonsense about his acting the part of great man very well and with dignity taking notice of the error in the ﬁrst edition in the ﬁrst edition he was wrongly credited with pieces that belonged to marlowe barneﬁeld grifﬁn and some authors unknown in the

calls the book worthless little volume of stolen and mutilated poetry patched up and padded out with dirty and dreary doggrel under the senseless and preposterous title of the passionate pilgrim on the other hand humphreys maintains that jaggard at any rate had very good taste this is partly seen in the choice of title few books have so charming name the passionate pilgrim it is perfect title jaggard also set up good precedent this collection was published year before england helicon and of course very many years before any authorized collection of shakespeare was issued we see in the passionate pilgrim forerunner of the golden t reasury and other anthologies now the title if the value of title lie in its application swinburne is right it has little relevance to the verses in the volume on the other hand portly and attractive mouthful of syllables the passionate pilgrim can hardly be surpassed if not perfect title it is surely charming name but humphreys contention that jaggard set up good precedent and produced forerunner of english anthologies becomes absurd when we remember that tottel miscellany was published in june 1557 just years before the passionate pilgrim

text notes and memoir the rev dyce now of the rev alexander dyce it may be fearlessly asserted that his criticism is not all time even had he been less prone to accept the word of john payne collier gospel even had shakespearian criticism made perceptible advance durin g the last quarter of century yet there is that in the rev alexander dyce treatment of his poet which would warn us to pause before accepting his word ﬁnal test of his æsthetic judgment we may turn to the songs from the plays of shakespeare with which this volume concludes it had been well in work of this sort to include all the songs but he gives us selection only and an uncommonly bad selection i have tried in vain to discover single principle of taste underlying it on what principle instance can man include the song come away come away death from twelfth night and omit mistress mine where are you roaming or include amiens two songs from you like it and omit the incomparable it was lover and his lass or what

may attribute this last pair to fletcher take take those lips away certainly occurs with second and inferior stanza in fletcher the bloody brother ﬁrst published in 1639 but dyce gives hint of his belief that fletcher wrote it we are therefore left to conclude that dyce thought it unworthy of place in his collection on the two noble kinsmen ﬁrst published in 1634 dyce is more explicit in footnote to the memoir he says the of the ﬁrst edition of fletcher two noble kinsmen attributes the play partly to shakespeare i not think our poet had any share in its composition but i must add that lamb great authority in such matters inclines to different opinion when lamb and the rev alexander dyce hold opposite opinions it need not be difﬁcult to choose and surely if internal evidence count anything at all the lines maiden pinks of odour faint daisies yet most quaint and sweet thyme true oxlips in their cradles growing not an angel of the air bird melodious or bird fair be absent hence

yellow hue paint the meadows with delight we hear repeated in this bridal song and if this be so it is but another proof us that dyce was not critic all time nor is the accent of ﬁnality conspicuous in such passages this from the memoir wright had heard that shakespeare much better poet than player and rowe tells us that soon after his admission into the company he became distinguished not an extraordinary actor yet an excellent writer perhaps his execution did not equal his conception of character but we may rest assured that he who wrote the incomparable instructions to the player in hamlet would never offend his audience by an injudicious performance i have more to urge against writing of this order than that it has passed out of fashion and that something different might reasonably have been looked in volume that bears the date 1894 on its the public owes bell sons heavy debt but at the same time the public has peculiar interest in such series that of the aldine poets purchaser who ﬁnds several of these books to his mind and is thereby induced to embark upon the purchase of the entire series must feel natural resentment if succeeding volumes drop below the implied standard he can not go back and to omit the offending volumes is to spoil his set and i contend that the action taken by bell sons in improving several of their more or less obsolete editions will only be entirely praiseworthy if we may take it an earnest of their desire to place the whole series on level with contemporary knowledge and criticism nor can anyone who knows how much the industry and enthusiasm of dyce did in his day the study of shakespeare more than urge that while viewed historically dyce criticism is entirely respectable it happens to be triﬂe belated in the year the points of difference between him and charles lamb are perhaps too obvious to need indication but we may sum them up by saying that whereas lamb being genius belongs to all time dyce being but an industrious person belongs to period it was period of rapid development doubt rapid we may learn ourselves by the easy process of taking down volume of chalmers english poets and turning to that immortal passage on shakespeare poems which chalmers put forth in the year 1810 the peremptory decision of steevens on the merits of these poems must not be omitted have not reprinted the sonnets of shakespeare because the strongest act of parliament that could be framed would fail to compel readers into their service had shakespeare produced other works than these his name would have reached us with little celebrity time has conferred upon that of thomas watson an older and much more elegant sonnetteer severe this may appear it only amounts to the general conclusion which modern critics have formed still it can not be denied that there are many scattered beauties among his sonnets and in the rape of lucrece enough it is hope d to justify their admission into the present collection especially the songs from his plays have been added and few smaller pieces selected by mr ellis comment can add to or take from the stupendousness of this and yet it was the criticism proper to its time i have only to hope writes chalmers in his preface that my criticisms will not be found destitute of candour or improperly interfering with the general and acknowledged principles of taste indeed they are not they were the rightpg 43 pg 44 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https chalmers dyce were the right opinions dyce and if we hope ours is larger appreciation of shakespeare we probably hold it by merit of our own but the common possession of our generation derived through the chastening experiences of our grandfathers that however is reason why we should not insist on having such editions of shakespeare fulﬁl our requirements and refuse to study dyce except an historical ﬁgure it is an unwise generation that declines to take all its inheritance i have heard once or twice of late that english poets in the future will set themselves to express emotions more complex and subtle than have ever yet been treated in poetry i shall be extremely glad of course if this happen in my time but at present i incline to rejoice rather in an assured inheritance and when i hear talk of this kind to say over to myself one particular sonnet

though i can not speak on this point with any certainty i imagine that our younger singers hold to the tradition of all their fathers and that daniel still renidet in angulo of their affections one who in his day did very much though quietly to train the growth of english verse and proved himself in everything he wrote an artist to the bottom of his conscience certainly spenser he was poet poet while he lived couple of pages might be ﬁlled almost offhand with the genuine compliments of his contemporaries and he will probably remain poet poet long poets write in english but the average reader of person who is honestly moved by good poetry and goes from time to time to his bookshelves an antidote to the common cares and trivialities of this to neglect daniel almost utterly i judge from the wretched insufﬁciency of his editions it is very hard to obtain anything beyond the two small volumes published in 1718 an imperfect collection and volume of selections edited by john morris and published by bath bookseller in 1855 and even these are only to be picked up here and there i ﬁnd it signiﬁcant too that in palgrave golden treasury daniel is represented by one sonnet only and that by means his best this neglect will appear the more singular to anyone who has observed how apt is the person whom i have called the average reader of culture to be drawn to the perusal of an author works by some attractive idiosyncrasy in the author private life or character lamb is staring instance of this attraction how we all love lamb to be sure though he rejected it and called out upon it gentle remains lamb constant epithet and curiously enough in the gentleness and digniﬁed melancholy of his life daniel stands nearer to lamb than any other english writer with the possible exception of scott his circumstances were less gloomily picturesque but i defy any feeling man to read the scanty narrative of daniel life and think of him thereafter without sympathy and respect life he was born in says in somersetshire not far from taunton others say at beckington near philip norton or at wilmington in wiltshire anthony wood tells us that he came of wealthy family fuller that his father was master of music of his earlier years next to nothing is known but in 1579 he was entered commoner at magdalen hall oxford and left the university three years afterwards without taking degree his ﬁrst translation of paola giovio treatise on peared in 1585 when he was about in 1590 or 1591 he was travelling in italy probably with pupil and doubt busy with those studies that ﬁnally made him the ﬁrst italian scholar of his time in 1592 he published his sonnets to delia which at once made his reputation in 1594 his complaint of rosamond and tragedy of cleopatra and in 1595 four books of his civil wars on spenser death in 1599 daniel is said to have succeeded to the ofﬁce of that wreath which in eliza golden days my master dear divinist spenser wore that which rewarded drayton learned lays which thoughtful ben and gentle daniel wore but history traces the laureateship an ofﬁce further back than jonson and we need not follow southey into the mists it is certain however that daniel was favorite at elizabeth court and in some way partook of her bounty in 1600 he was appointed tutor to the lady anne clifford little girl of about eleven daughter of margaret pg 48 pg 49 pg 50 pg the

written the actions of men i have been constrained to bide with children and contrary to mine own spirit put out of that sense which nature had made my part now there is but one answer to man of really strong spirit does not suffer himself to be put out of that sense which nature had made my part daniel words indicate the weakness that in the end made futile all his powers they indicate certain donnish timidity if i may use the epithet certain distrust of his own genius such timidity and such distrust often accompany very exquisite faculties indeed they may be said to imply certain exquisiteness of feeling but they explain why of the two contemporaries the robust ben jonson is living ﬁgure in most men conception of those times while samuel daniel is rather ﬂeeting ghost and his

sparingly make use of others wit and use his own the mor the pas of parnassus now it has been often pointed out that considerable writers fall into two 1 those who begin having something to say and are from the ﬁrst rather occupied with their matter than with the manner of expressing it and 2 those who begin with the love of expression and intent to be artists in words and come through expression to profound thought it is fashionable just now some reason or another to account class 1 the more respectable judgment to which considering that shakespeare and milton belonged undeniably to class 2 i refuse to assent the question however is not to be argued here i have only to point out in this place that the early work of all poets in classpg 52 pg 53 pg the project gutenberg ebook

imitative but poet of this class to reach the heights of song there must come time when out of imitation he forms genuine style of his own and loses mental fertility in the transformation this if i may use the metaphor is the mauvais pas in the ascent of parnassus and here daniel broke down he did indeed acquire style of his own but the effort exhausted him he was longer proliﬁc his ardor had gone and his innate distrustfulness made him quick to recognize his sterility soon after the accession of james daniel at the recommendation of his brother john florio possibly furthered by the interest of the earl of pembroke was given post gentleman extraordinary and groom of the privy chamber to anne of denmark and few months after was appointed to take the oversight of the plays and shows that were performed by the children of the queen revels or children of the chapel they were called under elizabeth he had thus snug position at court and might have been happy had it been another court but in nothing was the accession of james more apparent than in the almost instantaneous blasting of the taste manners and serious grace that had marked the court of elizabeth the court of james was court of bad taste bad manners and grace whatever and the remnant of another time he calls wistfully back upon the days of elizabeth but whereas he came planted in the spring and had the sun before him of respect we set in th autumn in the withering and sullen season of cold defect must taste those sour distastes the times bring upon the fulness of cloy neglect although the stronger constitutions shall wear out th infection of distemper days and so he stood dejected while the young men of stronger constitutions passed him by in this way it happened that daniel whom at the outset his contemporaries had praised with wide consent and who never wrote loose or unscholarly line came to pen in the dedicatory epistle preﬁxed to his traged y of philotas these the most pathetic ever uttered by an artist upon his work and therefore since i have outlived the date of former grace acceptance and delight i would my lines late born beyond the fate of her spent line had never come to

not alter to fairer judge thou by what i am so shalt thou ﬁnd fairest from which i take it that ebsworth claims his attitude towards carew to be much the same thackeray towards pendennis but in fact he proves himself partisan and anyone less enthusiastic may think himself lucky if dismissed by ebsworth with nothing worse than smile of pity mingled with contempt now so long an editor conﬁnes this belligerent enthusiasm to the defence of his author writings it is at worst but an amiable weakness and every word he says in their praise tends indirectly to justify his own labor in editing these meritorious compositions but when he extends this championship over the author private life he not unfrequently becomes something of nuisance we may easily forgive such talk there must assuredly have been singular frankness and affectionate simplicity in the disposition of carew talk which is harmless though hardly more valuable than the reﬂection beloved of local if these grey old walls could speak what tale might they not unfold it is less easy to give such note this sir john suckling was incapable of understanding carew in his ﬁnal days of sickness and depression he had been and this is conceding much in their earlier days of reckless gallantry his vile address tom i must confess i much admire is nothing more than coarse badinage without foundation in any case not necessarily addressed to carew although they were of close acquaintance but many other toms were open to similar expression since might apply to thomas carey to thomas crosse and other poets it is not pleasant to rake up any man faults but when an editor begins to suggest some new man against whom nothing is known except that he wrote indifferent verse 71 pg 72 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https not even known to have been on speaking terms with the proper target of suckling coarse raillery we have right not only to protest but to point out that even clarendon who liked carew wrote of him that after ﬁfty years of his life spent with less severity and exactness than it ought to have been he died with great remorse that license and with the greatest manifestation of christianity that his best friends could desire if carew thought ﬁt to feel remorse that license it scarcely becomes ebsworth to deny its existence much less to hint that the sinfulness was another correction minor criticism i may point out that the song come my celia let us prove included by ebsworth with the remark that there is external evidence to conﬁrm the attribution of this song to carew was written by ben jonson and is to be found in volpone act sc 7 but with some imperfections this is sound one of the most brilliant lyrical writers of his time it contains charming portrait and the editor enthusiasm when it does not lead him too far is also charming robinson crusoe april 13 robinson crusoe many book has produced wide and beneﬁcent effect and won great reputation and yet this effect and this reputation have been altogether wide of its author aim swift gulliver is one example birrell put it the other day swift gospel of hatred his testament of gulliver upon which he expended the treasures of his wit and into which he instilled the concentrated essence of his become child book and has been read with wonder and delight by generations of innocents how far is the tale parable generations of innocents in like manner have accepted robinson crusoe delightful tale about castaway mariner story of adventure pure and simple without intention of any kind but we know very well that defoe in writing it intended parable parable of his own life in the ﬁrst place he distinctly afﬁrms this in his preface to the serious reﬂections which form part iii of his great story the design of everything is said to be ﬁrst in the intention and last in the execution so i come now to acknowledge to my reader that the present work is not merely product of the two ﬁrst volumes but the two ﬁrst volumes may rather be called the product of this the fable is always made the moral not the moral the fable he goes on to say that whereas the envious and part of the world have accused the story of being feigned and all romance formed and embellished by invention to impose upon the world he declares this objection to be an invention scandalous in design and false in fact and afﬁrms that the story though allegorical is also historical that it is the beautiful representation of life of unexampled misfortunes and of variety not to be met with in the world sincerely adapted to and intended the common good of mankind and designed at ﬁrst it is now further applied to the most serious use possible farther that there is man alive and well known too the actions of whose life are the just subject of these volumes and to whom all or most part of the story most directly alludes this may be depended upon truth and to this i set my name pg 74 pg 75 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https proceeds to assert this in detail of several important passages in the book and obviously intends us to infer that the adventures of robinson crusoe of york mariner were throughout and from the beginning designed story in parable of the life and adventures of daniel defoe gentleman but defoe may have been lying this was never quite ﬂatly asserted even his enemy gildon admitted an analogy between the tale of crusoe and the stormy life of defoe with its frequent shipwrecks more by land than by sea gildon admitted this implicitly in the title of his pamphlet the life and strange surprising adventur es of of london hosier who has lived above fifty years by himself in the kingdoms of north and south britain but the question has always been to what extent are we to accept defoe statement that the story is an allegory does it agree step by step and in detail with the circumstances of defoe life or has it but general allegorical resemblance hitherto critics have been content with the general resemblance and have agreed that it would be mistake to accept defoe statement too literally to hunt minute allusions in robinson crusoe and search exact resemblances between incidents in the tale and events in the author life but this at any rate may be safely afﬁrmed that recent discoveries have proved the resemblance to be great deal closer than anyone suspected few years ago wright hypothesis aitken supplied the key when he announced in the athenæum august 23rd 1890 his discovery that daniel defoe was born not in 1661 had hitherto been supposed but earlier and probably in the latter part of the year the story dates crusoe birth september 30th 1632 or just years earlier now wright defoe latest biographer maintains that if we add these even years to the date of any event in crusoe life we shall have the date of the corresponding event in defoe life by this simple calculation he ﬁnds that crusoe running away to sea corresponds in time with defoe departure from the academy at newington green crusoe early perio d on the island south side with the years defoe lived at tooting crusoe visit to the other side of the island with journey of defoe into scotland the footprint and the arrival of the savages with the threatening letters received by defoe and the physical assaults made on him after the sacheverell trial while friday stands collaborator who helped defoe with his work defoe expressly states in his serious reﬂections that the story of friday is historical and true in it is most real that i had such servant savage and afterwards christian and that his name was called friday and that he was ravished from by force and died in the hands that took him which i represent by being killed this is all literally true and should i enter into discoveries many alive can testify them his other conduct and assistance to also have just references in all their parts to the helps i had from that faithful savage in my real solitudes and disasters it may be added that there are strong grounds believing defoe to have had about this time assistance in his literary work all this is very neatly worked out but of course the really important event in crusoe life is his great shipwreck and his long solitude on the island now of what events in defoe life are these symbolical the well in the very forefront of his serious reﬂections and in connection with his long conﬁnement in the island defoe makes crusoe tell the following story i have heard of man that upon some extraordinary disgust which he took at the unsuitable conversation of some of his nearest relations whosepg 77 pg 78 pg 79 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https he could not avoid suddenly resolved never to speak any more he kept his resolution most rigorously many years not all the tears or entreaties of his not of his wife and prevail with him to break his silence it seems it was their to him at ﬁrst that was the occasion of it they treated him with provoking language which frequently put him into undecent passions and urged him to rash replies and he took this severe way to punish himself being provoked and to punish them provoking him but the severity was unjustiﬁable it ruined his family and broke up his house his wife could not bear it and after endeavouring by all the ways possible to alter his rigid silence went ﬁrst away from him and afterwards from herself turning melancholy and distracted his children separated some one way and some another way and only one daughter who loved her father above all the rest kept with him tended him talked to him by signs and lived almost dumb like her father near years with him till being very sick and in high fever delirious we call it or he broke his silence not knowing when he did it and spoke though wildly at ﬁrst he recovered of his illness afterwards and frequently talked with his daughter but not much and very seldom to anybody else i italicise some very important words in the above story crusoe was wrecked on his island on september 30th 1659 his birthday we are told that he remained on the island years two months and nineteen days compare with duration of the man silence in the story this puts the date of his departure at december 19th now add years we ﬁnd that defoe left his that may have december 19th just at that date all his biographers record defoe was struck down by ﬁt of apoplexy and lay ill six weeks compare this again with the story you divine what is coming astoundin g it may be wright contends that defoe himself was the original of the story that defoe provoked by his wife irritating tongue made kind of vow to live life of kept it more than years so far back 1859 the egregious chadwick nibbled at this theory in his life and times of daniel defoe with remarks digressive and discursive the story he says would be very applicable to defoe himself and again is very likely to have been taken from his own life but at this point chadwick maunders off with the remark that perhaps the domestic ﬁreside of the poet or is not the place we should go to in search of domestic happiness perhaps not but chadwick tallyhoing after domestic happiness misses the scent wright sticks to the scent and rides boldly but is he after the real fox april 20 can we believe it can we believe that on the 30th of september 1686 defoe provoked by his wife nagging tongue made vow to live life of complete silence that years and month or two he never addressed word to his wife or children and that his resolution was only broken down by severe illness in the winter of 1714 aitken on mr wright hypothesis mr aitken b who has handled this hypothesis of wright brings several arguments against it which taken together seem to quite conclusive to begin with several children were born to defoe during this period he paid much attention to theirpg 81 pg 82 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https and in 1713 the penultimate year of this supposed silence we ﬁnd his sons helping him in his work again in 1703 defoe was interceding her husband release from newgate let add that it was an age in which personalities were freely used in public controversy that defoe was continuously occupied with public controversy during these years and managed to make many enemies any man within the four seas and i think the silence of his adversaries upon matter which if proved would be discreditabl in the extreme is the best of all evidence that wright hypothesis can not be sustained nor i see how wright makes it square with his own conception of defoe character of forgiving temper himself says wright on 86 he defoe was quite incapab le of understanding how another person could nourish resentment this of man whom the writer asserts to have sulked in absolute silence with his wife and family years two months and nineteen days an inherent improbability at all events it will not square with our conception of defoe character those of us who have an almost unlimited admiration defoe master of narrative and next to affection him man might pass the heartlessness of such conduct at ﬁrst sight wright admits it may appear monstrous that man should so long time abstain from speech with his own family monstrous i am afraid we could have passed that mr wright who has what i may call purﬂed style tells us to narrate the career of daniel defoe is to tell tale of wonder and daring of high endeavour and marvellous success to dwell upon it is to take courage and to praise god the splendid possibilities of life defoe is always the hero his career is thick with events cornﬁeld with corn his fortunes change quickly and completely the shapes in is up he is down he is courted he is spurned it is shine it is shower it is couleur rose it is stygian night thirteen times he was rich and poor achilles was not more audacious ulysses more subtle æneas more pious that is one way of putting it here is another way the cookery books say t narrate the career of daniel defoe is to tell tale of hosier and pantile maker who had hooked nose and wrote tracts indefatig was up he was down he was in the pillory he was at tooting it was poule soie it was leather and prunella and it was always tracts æneas was not so pious member of the butchers company and there are few milestones on the dover road but defoe life was thick with tracts cornﬁeld with corn these two estima tes may differ here and there but on one point they defoe was an extremely restless pushing voluble person who could soon have stood on his head years two months and nineteen days have kept silence that period with any man or woman in whose company he found himself frequently alone unless we have entirely misjudged his d i may add unless wright has completely misrepresented the rest of his simply was not in the man to keep this foolish vow hours i am afraid wright hypothesis will not and yet his plan of adding seven years to each important date in crusoe history has revealed so many coincident events in the life of defoe that we can not help feeling he is hot they say in the children game that the wreck upon the island and crusoe years odd of solitude really correspond with some great event and important period of defoe life the wreck is dated 30th september add the years and we come to september 30th where was defo at that date and what was he doing wright has to confess that of his movements in 1686 and the two following years we know little that is deﬁnite certainly we know of nothing that can correspond with crusoe shipwreck 84 pg 85 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https wait original editions of robinson crusoe and most if not all later editions give the date of crusoe departure from the island december 19th 1686 instead of wright suggests that this is misprint and to be sure it does not agree with the statement respecting the length of crusoe stay on the island if we assume the date of the wreck to be correct but aitken points out the mistake must be the author not the printer because in the next paragraph we are told that crusoe reached england in june 1687 not i agree with aitken and i suggest that the date of crusoe arrival at the island not the date of his departur is the date misprinted assume moment that the date of departure december 19th 1686 is correct subtract the years two months and nineteen days of crusoe stay on the island and we get september 30th 1658 the date of the wreck and his arrival at the island now add the years which separate crusoe experiences from defoe and we come to september 30th what was happening in england at the close of september 1685 why jeffreys was carrying through his bloody assize like many other dissenters says wright on 21 defoe sympath ised with monmouth and to his misfortune took part in the rising his comrades perished in it and he himself in wright words probably had to lie low there is doubt that the monmouth affair was the beginning of defoe troubles and i suggest that certain passages in the story of crusoe voyage the secret proposal of the three merchants who came to crusoe have peculiar signiﬁcance if read in this connection i also think it possible there may be particular meaning in the several waves so carefully described through which crusoe made his way to dry land and in the simile of the reprieved malefactor 50 in mr aitken delightful edition and in the several visits to the wreck i am specialist in defoe but put this suggestion forward with the utmost difﬁdence and yet right or wrong i feel it has more plausibility than wright defoe undoubtedly took part in the monmouth rising and was survivor of that wreck on the south side of the island and undoubtedly it formed the of his career if we could discover how he escaped kirke and jeffreys i am inclined to believe we should have key to the whole story of the shipwreck i should not be sorry to ﬁnd this hypothesis upset the story of robinson crusoe is quite good enough it stands and without any but whatever be the true explanation of the parable if time shall discover it i confess i expect it will be triﬂe less recondite than wright and triﬂe more creditable to the father of the english

twice stated by defoe and by adding eight years to 1658 we get 1686 the date given crusoe departure it is however questionable whether this rectiﬁcation helps us to interpret the allegory in robinson crusoe it is true that if in accordance with the suggested by wright we add seven years to the date of the shipwreck 1658 in order to ﬁnd the corresponding event in defoe life we arrive at september 1685 when jeffreys was sentencing many of those took part in monmouth rising but we have evidence that defoe suffered seriously in consequence of the part he took in this rebellion and the addition of years to the date of crusoe departure from the island december 1686 does not bring us to any corresponding event in defoe own story those who are curious will ﬁnd the question discussed at greater length in the speaker april 13 and 20 and may 4 1895 la wrence sterne 10 sterne and thackeray it is told by those who write scraps of thackeray biography that youth once ventured to speak disrespectfully of scott in his presence you and i sir said the great man cutting him short should lift our hats at the mention of that great name an admirable rebuke only thackeray had remembered it when he sat down to write those famous lectures on the english humorists or at least before he stood up in willis rooms to inform polite audience concerning his great predecessors concerning their work concerning their genius concerning the debt owed to them by mankind not bit of it concerning their lives ladies and gentlemen and whether their lives were pure and respectable and free from scandal and such men ought to have led whose works you would like your sons and daughters to handle frank marzials thackeray latest biographer ﬁnds the matter of these lectures excellent one feels in the reading that thackeray is peer among his sort of elder brother kindly appreciative and he discourses of addison steele swift pope sterne fielding goldsmith i know of greater contrast in contrast be it said not to the advantage of the french thackeray treatment of pope and that of taine what allowance the englishman makes the physical ills that beset the little cripple with what gentle hand he touches the painful places in that poor twisted body taine irritated apparently that pope will not ﬁt into his conception of english literature exhibits the same deformities almost savagely i am sorry

unsuspectingly 90 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https even though the lives and actions of men who lived too early to know victorian decency must be held up to shock crowd in willis rooms yet it had been but common generosity to tell the whole truth then the story of fielding voyage to lisbon might have touched the heart to sympathy even the purely ﬁctitious low comedian whom thackeray presented and sterne latest letters might have infused so much pity into the polite audience that they like his own recording angel might have blotted out his faults with tear but that was not thackeray way charlotte brontë found ﬁnished taste and ease in the lectures something high bred motley describes their style hovering and their method the perfection of lecturing to audiences marzials quotes this expression hovering admirably descriptive it is by judicious selection by innuendo here pitying aposiopesis there an indignant outburst the

dick steele drank and failed to pay his creditors really i know what club life is ladies and gentlemen and i might tell you thing or two if i would but really speaking gentleman before polite audience i warn you against sterne i not suppose moment that thackeray consciously defamed these men the weaknesses the pettinesses of humanity interested him and he treated them with gusto even he spares us nothing of that horrible scene between mackenzie and colonel newcome and of course poor sterne was the easiest victim the fellow was so full of his confounded sentiments you ring choice few of these on the counter and prove them base metal you assume that the rest of the bag is of equal value you go one better than sir peter teazle and damn all sentiment and lo the fellow is better than smirking jester whose antics you can expose till men and women who had foolishly laughed and wept he moved them turn from him loathing him swindler so it is that although tristram shandy continues one of the most popular classics in the language nobody dares to confess his debt to sterne except in discreet terms of apology but the fellow wrote the book you ca deny that though thackeray may tempt you to forget it what proportion does my uncle toby hold in that amiable lecture the truth is that the elemental simplicity of captain shandy and corporal trim did not appeal to the author of the book of snobs in the same degree the pettiness of the man sterne appealed to him and his business in willis rooms was to talk not of captain shandy but of the man sterne to whom his hearers were to feel themselves superior members of society i submit that this was not worthy task man of letters who was also man of genius i submit that it was an inversion of the true critical method to wreck sterne sentimental journey at the outset by picking sterne life to pieces holding up the shreds and warning the reader that any nobility apparent in his book will be nothing better than sham sterne is scarcely arrived at calais and in conversation with the monk before you are cautioned how you listen to the impostor watch now says the critic he be at his tricks in moment hey paillasse there i tell you and yet i am sure that the opening pages of the sentimental journey are full of genuine feeling i am that if jonathan swift had entered the room while the lecture upon him was going forward he would have eaten william makepeace goliath white waistcoat and all frenchmen who either are less awed than we by lecturers in white waistcoats or understand the methods of criticism somewhat better cherish the sentimental journey in spite of its indifferent french and believe in the genius that created it but the briton reads it with shyness and the british critic speaks of sterne with bated

henley and whibley have made the best of it and given us new edition of the old tristram handsome volumes with shapely pages fair type and an introduction whibley supplies the introduction and that he writes lucidly and forcibly needs not to be said his position is neither that so unfairly taken up by thackeray nor that of allibone who writing heaven knows how many of allibone maiden aunts summed up sterne thus standing reproach to the profession which he disgraced grovelling in his tastes indiscreet if not licentious in his habits he lived unhonoured and died unlamented save by those who found amusement in his wit or countenance in his immorality b but though he avoids these particular excesses though he goes straight the book critic should mr whibley can not get quit of the bad

to dangle before the public gaze those poor shreds of sensibility he calls his feelings though he seldom deceives the reader into sympathy none will turn from his choicest agony without thrill of

he would not hurt ﬂy to this trivial action of his is more than merely sentimental but be this it may i am sure it is honestly characteristic still on the whole whibley has justice sterne is sentimentalist sterne is indecent by reason of his indecent than rabelais because he uses hint where rabelais would have said what he meant and prints dash where rabelais would have plumped out with

his own i not think much of whibley instance of servius sulpicius letter doubt sterne took his translation of it from burton but the letter is very well known one and burton translation happened to be uncommonly good and the borrowing of good rendering without acknowledgment was not far i know then forbidden by custom in any case the whole passage is intended merely to lead up to the beautiful

whibley all the best in sterne is still sterne own but the more i agree with whibley strictures the more i desire to remove them from an introduction to tristram shandy and to read them in volume of whibley collected essays were it not better in reading tristram shandy to take sterne once if only change at his own valuation or at least to accept the original postulates of the story if only the entertainment he provides we owe him the effort there will be time enough afterwards to turn to the cold judgment of this or that critic or to the evidence of this or that the moment he claims to be heard without prejudice he has genius enough to make it worth our while to listen without prejudice and the most lenient appreciation of his sins if we read it beforehand is bound to raise prejudice and infect our enjoyment we read and corollary of this demand let us ask that he shall be allowed to present his book to us exactly he chooses whibley says he set out upon the road of authorship with false ideal said he properly managed is but different name conversation it would be juster to assert that writing is never properly managed unless it be removed from conversation far possible very true or at least very likely but since sterne had this ideal let us grant him full liberty to make his spoon or spoil his horn and let us judge afterwards concerning the result the famous blackened page and the empty pages all omitted in this new edition are part of sterne method they may seem to us ork and foolery but if we consider they link on to his notion that writing is but name conversation they are included in his demand that in writing book man should be allowed to go cluttering away like mad you may take my word is sterne who speaks and in his very ﬁrst you may take my word that nine parts in ten of man sense or his nonsense his success and miscarriages in this world depend upon their motions and activity and the different tracks and trains you put them into so that when they are once set whether right or wrong is not halfpenny they go cluttering like mad and by treading the same steps over and over again they presently make road of it plain and smooth garden walk which when once they are used to the devil himself sometimes shall not be able to drive them of f it this at any rate is sterne own postulate and i had rather judge him with all his faults after reading the book than be prepared beforehand to make allowances 12 sterne let one thing be recorded to the credit of this man he wrote two masterpieces of ﬁction one of them work of considerable length and in neither will you ﬁnd an character or an word on the admission of all critics my father my mother my uncle toby corporal trim and wadman are immortal creations to the making of them there has gone single sour or uncharitable thought they are essentially amiable and the same may be said of all the minor characters and of the author disquisitions sterne has given us thousand occasions to laugh but never an occasion to laugh on the wrong side of the mouth savagery or bitterness you will search his books in vain he is obscene to be sure but who pray was ever the worse having read him

him forward little way our best biographies are all of men and women of it may be added of beautiful johnson scott and charlotte brontë there are certain people whose biograp hies ought to be long who could learn too much concerning lamb and concerning scott who will not agree with lockhart remark in the preface to his abridged edition of 1848 i should have been more willing to produce an enlar ged edition the interest of sir walter history lies i think peculiarly in its minute details you may explore here and explore there and still you ﬁnd pure gold the man was gold right through so in the present volume every line is of interest because we refer it to scott known character and test it thereby the result is always the same yet the employment does not weary in themselves the letters canno t stand mere writing beside the letters of cowper or of lamb they are just the epistles of man who to his last day remained too modest to believe in the extent of his own genius the letters in this collection which show most acuteness on literary matters are not scott but lady louisa stuart who appre ciated the novels on their appearance their faults well their merits with judiciousness quite wonderful in contemporary scott literary observations with the exception of one passage where the attitude of an english gentleman towards literature is stated he asks of it that it shall arouse him from his habitual contempt of what goes on about him are much less amusing and his letters to joanna baillie the dullest in the volume unless it be the answers which joanna baillie sent best of all perhaps is the correspondence scarcely used by lockhart between scott and lady abercorn with its ﬁtful intervals of warmth and reserve this alone would justify douglas volumes but indeed while nothing can be found now to alter men conception of scott any book about him is justiﬁed even if it more than heap up superﬂuous testimony to the beauty of his character june 15 racial disability since about of the number of my particular friends happen to be scotsmen it has always distressed and annoyed that with the best will in the world i have never been able to understand on what principle that perfervid race conducts its enthusiasms mine is racial disability of course and the converse has been noted by less writer than stevenson in the story of his journey across the plains

weighs down with sense of hopeless obtuseness when i consider the deportment of the average intelligent scot at burns banquet or burns conversazione or burns festival or the unveiling of burns statue or the putting up of pillar on some spot made famous by burns all over the all under it too when their time are preparing speeches about burns the great globe swings round out of the sun into the dark there is always midnight somewhere and always in this shifting region the eye of imagination sees orators gesticulating over burns companies of heated exiles with crossed arms shouting auld lang syne lesser haply they be under tables still in honor of burns and the vast continents sweep eastering out of the high shadow which reaches beyond the moon and new nations with their cities and villages their mountains and seashores rise up on the lo fresh troops and still fresh troops and yet again fresh troops wend or are carried out of action with the dawn scott and burns none but churl would wish this enthusiasm abated but why is it all lavished on burns that is what gravels the southron why burns why not sir walter had i the honor to be of scott and had i command of the racial it seems to that i would tund upon it in honor of that great man until i dropped to southron scott is the most imaginative and at the same time the justest writer of our language since shakespeare died to say this is not to suggest that he is comparable with shakespeare scott himself sensible ever wrote in his journal the blockheads talk of my being like ﬁt to tie his brogues but it is also true said swinburne in his review of the journal that if there were or could be any man whom it would not be monstrous absurdity to compare with shakespeare creator of men and inventor of circumstance that man could be none other than scott greater poems than his have been written and to my mind one or two novels better than his best but when one considers the huge mass of his work and its quality in the mass the vast range of his genius and its command over that range who shall be compared with him these are the reﬂections which occur somewhat obviously to the southron character it is enough to say that scott was one of the best men who ever walked on this planet and that burns was not but scott was not merely good he was winningly good of character so manly temperate courageous that men read his life his journal his letters with thrill they might read of rorke drift or chitral how then are we to account the undeniable fact that his countrymen in public at any rate wax more enthusiastic over burns is it that the homeliness of burns appeals to them wandering race is it because in farthest exile line of burns takes their hearts straight back to scotland when luath the collie in the twa

it surprising amount of inferior stuff but such pathos the above scott can not touch i can understand the man who holds that these deeps of pathos should not be probed in literature and am not sure that i wholly disagree with him the question certainly is discutable and worth discussing but such pathos at any rate is immensely popular and perhaps this will account the hold which burns retains on the affections of race which has right to be at least thrice proud of scott however if burns is honored at the feast scott is read by the ﬁreside hardly have the rich drybur gh and border editions issued from the press before archibald constable and are bringing out their reprint of the famous edition of the novels and barrie is supposed to be meditating another with introductory notes of his own upon each novel in my own opinion nothing has ever beaten or come near to beat the waverley of 1829 and constable and were happily inspired when they decided to make this the basis of their new edition they have improved upon it in two respects the paper is lighter and better and each novel is kept within its own covers whereas in the old editions volume would contain the end of one novel and beginning of another the original illustrations by wilkie landseer leslie stanﬁeld bonington and the rest have been retained in order to make the reprint complete but this seems to pity number of them were bad to begin with and will be worse than ever now being reproduced i understand from impressions of the original plates to without illustrations were counsel of perfection but now that the novels have become historical surely it were better to illustrate them with authentic portraits of scott pictures of scenery facsimiles of and so on than with worn reproduction of what stephanof f thought that flora looked like while playing the harp and introducing few irregular strains which harmon ized well with the distant waterfall and the soft sigh of the evening breeze in the rustling leaves of an aspen which overhung the fair stephanof f does not seem to have known the dif ference between an aspen and birch in short did it not contain the same illustrations this edition would

question has puzzled many another englishman besides and yet the explanation is not far to seek burns appeals to the hearts and feelings of the masses in way scott never does admits this and gives quotations in support these quotations however excellent in their way are not those that any scotsman would trust to in support of the above proposition scotsman would at once appeal to wha hae lang syne and man man that the very familiarity of these quotations has bred the proverbial contempt think of the fury of wha hae the glad kind ever fresh greeting of lang syne the manly sturdy independence of man man that and who can wonder at the enthusiasm burns name is there honest poverty that hangs his head and that the coward slave we pass him we dare be poor that rank is but the guinea the man the gowd that nor is it in his patriotism independence and conviviality alone that burns touches every mood of scotsman heart there is an enthusiasm of humanity about burns which you will hardly ﬁnd equalled in any other author and which most certainly does not exist in scott inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn has man this will and power to make his fellow mourn these quotations might be multiplied were it necessary but i think enough has been said to explain what puzzles i have an unbounded admiration of sir great indeed i think him the greatest of all novelists but scot somewhat anglicised by residence in london of more than quarter of century i unhesitatingly say that i would rather be the author of the above three lyrics of burns than i would be the author of all scott novels certain i am that if immortality were my aim i should be much surer of it in the one case than the other i can not conceive wha hae lang syne ever dying are there any of scott writings of which the same could be said i doubt it am yours london june 18th 1895 the hopelessness of the difﬁculty is amusingly if rather distressingly illustrated by this letter here again you have the best will in the world nothing could be kindlier than tone scot he has every reason to be impatient of stupidity on the subject of burns yet he takes real pains to set right alas his explanations leave more than ever at sea more desperate than ever of understanding what exactly it is in burns that kindles this peculiar enthusiasm in scots men and drives them to express it in feasting and oratory after casting about some time i suggested that in so many respects immeasurably inferior to wrote with depth of feeling which scott could not command on second thoughts this was wrongly put scott may have possessed the feeling together with notions of his own on the propriety of displaying itpg 117 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas

delighted my dear little half is turning out beautiful i was at her christening poor soul and took the oaths representing i forget whom that was in the time when dalkeith was dalkeith how changed alas i was forced there the other day by some people who wanted to see the house and i felt if it would have done great deal of good to have set my manhood aside to get into corner and cry like schoolboy

pleasing reﬂection though saddened by the thought that their voices are silent and their halls empty yes indeed scott possessed deep feelings though he did not exhibit them to the public now burns does exhibit his deep feelings i demonstrated by quotations and i suggested that it is just his strength of emotion his command of pathos and readiness to employ it by which burns appeals to the mass of his countrymen on this point expressly agrees with will have nothing to with my quotations however excellent in their way these quotations may be they are not those that any scotsman would trust to in support of the above proposition the above proposition being that burns appeals to the hearts and feelings of the masses in way that scott never does you see i have concluded rightly but on wrong evidence let us see then what evidence scotsman will call to prove that burns is writer of deep feeling scotsman says would at once appeal to scots wha hae auld lang syne and man man that think of the fury of wha hae the glad kind ever fresh greeting of lang syne the manly sturdy independence of man man that and who can wonder at the enthusiasm burns name i would rather says be the author of the

be comforting to authors if true but is it true day or two ago i picked up on railway bookstall copy of chatto windus new sixpenny edition of the cloister and the hearth and capital edition it is i think i must have worn out more copies of this book than of any other but somebody robbed of the pretty elzevir edition soon it came out and so i have only just read walter besant introduction which the publishers have considerately reprinted and thrown in with one of the cheapest sixpennyworths that ever came from the press good wine needs bush and the bush which besant hangs out is very small one but one sentence at least has challenged attention i not say that the whole of life it was at the end of the fourteenth century may be found in the cloister and the hearth but i say that there is portrayed so vigorous lifelike and truthful picture of time long gone by and differing in almost every particular from our own that the world has never seen its like to it is picture of the past more faithful than anything in the works of scott this last i remember called very bold one when it ﬁrst appeared in print to it seems altogether moderate go steadily through scott and which of the novels can you choose to compare with the cloister vigorous lifelike and truthful picture of time long gone by is it ivanhoe gay and beautiful romance doubt but surely the late freeman was at pains to point out not lifelike and truthful picture of any age that ever was is it old mortality well but even if we here get something more like vigorous lifelike and truthful picture of time gone by we are bound to consider the scale of the two books size counts aristotle pointed out and we usually forget it is the whole of western europe that reade reconstructs the groundwork of his simple story besant might have said more he might have pointed out that novel of scott approaches the cloister in lofty humanity in sublimity of pathos the last ﬁfty pages of the tale reach an elevation of feeling that scott never touched or dreamed of touching and the sentiment is sane and honest too the author reaches to the height of his great argument easily and without strain it seems to that an appeal to the feelings the page that tells of margaret death is the ﬁnest thing in ﬁction it appeals score of reasons and each reason is noble one we have brought together in that page extreme love resignation courage religious feeling we have the end of beautiful the end of good woman and the last earthly trial of good man and with all this there is vulgarization of sacred ground cheap parade of the heart secrets but deep sobriety relieved with the most delicate humor moreover the language is charles reade at its is almost good at its worst it is abominable that scott could never reach the emotional height of margaret or of the scene in clement cave is certain moreover in the cloister reade challenges comparison with scott on scott own ground of sustained adventurous the advantage is not with scott once more take all the waverley novels and search them through two passages to beat the adventures of gerard and denis the burgundian 1 with the bear and 2 at the fair star inn by the burgundian frontier i not think you will succeed even then indeed i will go so far to say that to match these adventures of gerard and denis you must go again to charles reade to the homeward voyage of the agra

gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https now we come to the proposition that an author must be judged by his best work if this proposition be true then i must hold reade to be greater novelist than scott but i hold this does anyone hold this why the contention would be an absurdity reade wrote some twenty novels beside the cloister and the hearth and not one of the twenty approaches it one grifﬁth gaunt ﬁt to be named in the same day with it and grifﬁth gaunt is marred by an insincerity in the plot which vitiates and is at once felt to vitiate the whole work on everything he wrote before and after the cloister reade essential vulgarity of mind is written large that he shook it off in that great instance is one of the miracles of literary history it may be that the sublimity of his theme kept him throughout in state of unnatural exaltation if the case can not be explained thus it can not be explained at all other of his writings display the same or at any rate like capacity sustained narrative hard cash displays it parts of it is never too late to mend display it but over much of these two novels lies the trail of that defective taste which makes simpleton instance prodigy of cheap ineptitude but if reade be hopelessly scott inferior in manner and taste what shall we say of the invention of the two men barrie once afﬁrmed very wisely in an essay on robert louis stevenson critics have said it is difﬁcult to write of steven son without alan breck is good anything in scott alan breck is certainly masterpiece quite worthy of the greatest of all who nevertheless it should be remember ed created these rich side characters by the score another befor dinner inventiveness is i suppose one of the ﬁrst qualities of great novelist and to scott invention there was end but set aside the cloister and reade invention will be found to be extraordinarily barren plot after plot turns on the same old tiresome trick two young people are in love by the villainy of third person they are separated while and one of the lovers is persuaded that the other is dead the missing one may be kept missing by various devices but always he is supposed to be dead and always evidence is brought of his death and always he turns up in the end it is the same in the cloister in it is never too late to mend in put yourself in his place in grifﬁth gaunt in simpleton sometimes in hard cash and terrible temptation he is wrongfully incarcerated madman but this is obviously variant only on the favorite trick now the device is good enough in tale of the fourteenth century when news travelled slowly and when by the suppression of letter or by piece of false news two lovers the one in holland the other in rome could easily be kept apart but in tale of modern life trick could well be stagier besides the incomparable margaret whom it does one good to hear besant say heroine in ﬁction is more dear to drew some admirable portraits of women but his men to tell the and especially his priggish young remarkably ill invented again of course i except the cloister omit that book and you would say that such character bailie nicol jarvie or dugald dalgetty

threw the wash about on both sides of the way more like unto trundling mop or wild goose at play than did henry kingsley the decent ﬂow of ﬁction when the mood was on him his notion of constructing novel was to take equal parts of wooden melodrama and low comedy and stick them boldly together in paste of impertinent drollery and serious but entirely irrelevant moralizing and yet each time i read

class of anglican divine at foreign table may perhaps understand the antipathy there was almost always certain sleek offensiveness about charles kingsley when he sat down to write he had knack of using the most insolent language and attributing the vilest motives to all poor foreigners and roman catholics and other folk and would exhibit pained and completely ludicrous surprise on ﬁnding that he had hurt the feelings of these unhappy kind of indignant wonder that providence should have given them any feelings to hurt at length encouraged by popular applause this very man attacked very man

pleasant isle of avès and when all the world is young lad and the ﬁrst two stanzas of the sands of dee neither in prose nor in verse could henry come near such excellence but we may go farther take

delightful and westwar d ho detestable in some parts it is admi rable in others that i have read ravenshoe again and again merely pleasure and that i can never read dozen pages of westwar d ho without wishing to put the book in the ﬁre but if you ask which i consider the greater novel i answer with equal readiness that westwar d ho is not only the greater but much the greater it is truth too seldom

the whole book almost too clever the performance was wonderful the promise triﬂe dangerous the invasion composition indeed proved the curse of the invasion of the crimea kinglake was slow writer and composed with his eye on the page the paragraph the phrase rather than on the whole work force and accuracy of expression are but parts of good prose style indeed are strictly speaking inseparable from perspective balance logical connection rise and fall of emotion it is but an indifferent landscape that contains pedestrian levels and his desire the immediate success of each paragraph it came

least metaphor from the undoubtedly he had the distinction of his class but its narrowness was his surely also the partisanship of the eight volumes grows into weariness the longevity of the english bench is notorious but it comes of hearing both sides of every question after all he was splendid artist he tamed that beautiful and dangerous beast the english sentence with difﬁculty indeed but having tamed worked it to high achievements the great occasion always found him capable and his treatment of it is not of the sort to be forgotten witness the picture of the prince president cowering

say will doubt be set down to tribal malevolence but i confess that if cambridge men appeal to less at one time than another it is when they begin to talk about their poets the grievance is an old one of least old birrell obiter dicta but it has been revived by the little book of verse quo musa tendis that i have just been reading i laid it down and thought of birrell essay on cambridge poets he calls them and then of another zealous gentleman hailing from the same university who arranged all the british bards in tripos and brought out the cambridge men at the top this was very characteristic performance but birrell is hardly less so in these days when to quote the epistolary parent so much prominence is given to athleticism in our seats of learning he picks out team of lightblue singers though he meant to play an match and challenges oxford to come on he gives milton blue and says we ought to play shelley because shelley is in residence now to this is astonishing if my butcher were to brag about kirke white my doctor might retort with keats and my i had knock them both down with the name of milton it would be pretty but i can not see that it would affect the relative merits of mutton and laudanum and the obscure products of scrivenage nor conversely they say at cambridge is it certain or even likely that the difference between butcher or doctor is the difference between kirke white and keats and this talk about university poets seems somewhat otiose unless it can be shown that cambridge and oxford directly encourage poesy or aim to so i am aware that somebody wins the newdigate every year at oxford and that the same thing happens annually at cambridge with respect to the chancellor prize hark back to the butcher and are perennially made upon lipton hams and allen hair restorer obviously some incentive is needed beyond prize stanzas on given subject i can understand cambridge men when they assert that they produce more wranglers than oxford that is justiﬁable boast but how does cambridge encourage poets calverley oxford expelled shelley cambridge whipped milton facit indignatio versus if we press this misreading of juvenal oxford erred only on the side of thoroughness but that notoriously is oxford way she expelled landor calverley and some others my contention is that to expel man you look at his poesy than to make don of him oxford says you are poet therefore this is place you go elsewhere we set your aspiring soul at large cambridge says you are poet let us employ you to fulﬁl other functions be don she made don of gray of calverley cambridge men are ever casting calverley in our teeth whereas in truth he is specially to be quoted against them everybody knows he was at both unive rsities so over him we have fair chance of comparing methods everybody knows he went to balliol ﬁrst and his ample cabin spirit led him to climb wall late at night somethingpg 147 pg 148 pg 149 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in

went to cambridge and cambridge made don of him if anybody thinks this was an intelligent stroke let him consider the result calverley wrote small amount of verse that merely verse is absolutely faultless to comp are great things with little you might well try to alter line of virgil one of calverley forget single epithet and substitute another and the result is certain disaster he has the perfection of the there it ends i can not remember single line of calverley that contains spark of human feeling birrell himself has observed that calverley is just bit inhuman but the cause of it does not seem to have occurred to him nor does the biography explain it if we are to believe the common report of all who knew calverley he was man of simple mind and sincere of quick and generous emotions his biographers tell us also that he was one who seemed to have the world at his feet one who had only to choose calling to excel in it yet he never fulﬁlled his friends high expectations what was the reason of it all the accident that cut short his career is not wholly to blame i think at any rate it will not explain away the exception i have taken to his verse had that been destined to exhibit the humanity which we seek some promise of it would surely be discoverable he was man at the time of that unhappy tumble on the ice but there is none it is all sheer wit impish fairy changeling and always barren of feeling birrell has not supplied the explanatory epithet so i will try to so it is donnish cambridge fondly imagining that she was showing right appreciation of calverley thereby gave him fellowship walter besant another gentleman from calverley college complained the other day that literary distinction was never marke d with peerage it is the same sort of error and now cambridge having made calverley don claims him cambridge poet and the claim is just if the epithet be intended to mark the limitations imposed by that university on his achievement of whose second volume quo musa tendis macmillan bowles has just come from the press it is fashionable to say that he follows after calverley at some distance to be sure he himself has encouraged this belief by coming from cambridge and writing about cambridge and invoking on the ﬁrst page of his earlier volume lapsus calami but except that does his talent some violence by constraining it to imitate calverley form the two men have little in common the younger has very different wit he is more than academical he thinks and feels upon subjects that were far outside calverley scope among the dozen themes with which he deals under the general heading of paullo majora canamus there is not one which would have interested his master in the least calverley appears to have invited his soul after this come let us go into the king parade and view the under graduate he walks about having knowledge of good or evil let us make jest of the books he admires and the schools which he is reading

of the man and the woman who have been married ﬁfty years to assure yourself that if be not calverley equal it is only because his mind is vexed with problems bigger than ever presented themselves to

their general presentment of life or holding up the rajah diamond against aladdin i am merely pointing out that life is presented to us in galland and in stevenson ﬁrst book of tales under very similar chief difference being that stevenson has to abate something of the supernatural or to handle it less frankly but several years divide the new arabian nights from the island nights entertainments and in the interval our author has writte n the master of ballantrae and his famous open letter on father damien that is to say he has grown in his understanding of the human creature and in his speculations upon his creature duties and destinies he has travelled far on shipboard and in emigrant trains has passed through much sickness has acquired property and responsibility has mixed in public affairs has written footnote to history and sundry letters to the times and even his latest letter shows stands in some danger of imprisonment therefore while the title of his new volume would seem to refer us once more to the old arabian models we are not surprised to ﬁnd this apparent design belied by the contents the third story indeed the isle of voices has afﬁnity with some of the arabian sindbad adventures instance but in the longer beach of falesá and the bottle imp we are dealing with debauch of fancy but with the problems of real life what is the knot untied in the beach of falesá if i mistake not our interest centres neither in case dirty trick of the marriage nor in his more trick of the contraptions the ﬁrst but helps to construct the problem the second seems superﬂuity the problem is and the author puts it before us fair and square how is wiltshire fairly loose moralist with some generosity of heart going to treat the girl he has wronged and i am bound to say that soon wiltshire answers that question before the an excellent scene and most dramatically interest in the story which is but halftold at this point begins to droop i said the chapter strikes stiff and the conclusion but umble and i feel certain that the story itself is to blame and neither the scenery nor the persons being one of those who had lief stevenson spake of the south seas of the hebrides so that he speak and i listen let it be granted that the polynesian names are triﬂe hard to distinguish at are easier than russian by many the difﬁculty vanishes you read the song of rahér or the footnote to history and if it comes to habits customs scenery i protest man must be exacting who can ﬁnd romance in these while reading melville typee the story itself is to blame but what is the human problem in the bottle imp imagine scheherazadé with human problem nothing less if you please than the problem of less and even something more in this case when the wife has made her great sacriﬁce of self it is fortuitous god but her own husband who wins her release and at price less fearful than she herself has paid keawe being in possession of bottle which must infallibly bring him to unless he can dispose of it at certain price kokua his wife by stratagem purchases the bottle from him and stands committed to the doom he has escaped she does her best to hide this from keawe but he by accident discovering the truth by another stratagem wins back the curse upon his own head and is only rescued by deus ex machinâ in the shape of drunken boatswain two or three reviewers have already given utterance upon this volume and they seem strangely unable to determine which is the best of its three tales i vote the bottle imp without second doubt and if asked my reasons must answer 1 that it deals with high and universal problem whereas in the isle of voices there is problem at all and in the beach of falesá the problem is less momentous and perhaps though of this i wo be sure more closely restricted by the accidents of circumstance and individual character 2 i have hinted the beach of falesá has faults of construction one of which is serious if not vital while the isle of voices though beautifully composed is tied down by the triviality of its subject but the bottle imp is perfectly constructed the last page ends the tale and the tale is told with light grace sportive

us that he wants to write something by which he may be ever known his attempts in this direction have been in the nature of trying different ways and he always starts off whistling having gone so far without losing himself he turns back to try another road does his heart fail him despite his jaunty bearing or is it because there is hurry but it is quite time the great work was begun i have taken the liberty to italicise word or two because in them barrie supplied an answer to his question the lyf so short the craft so long to lerne is not an exhortation to hurry and in stevenson case at any rate there was not the least need to hurry there was indeed time when stevenson had not persuaded himself of this in across the plains he tells us how at windy anstruther and an extremely early age he used to draw his chair to the table and pour forth literature at such speed and with such intimations of early death and immortality i now look back upon with wonder then it was that i wrote voces fidelium series of dramatic monologues in verse then that i indited the bulk of covenanting so many others never ﬁnished late i sat into the night toiling i thought under the very dart of death toiling to leave memory behind i feel moved to thrust aside the curtain of the years to hail that poor feverish idiot to bid him go to bed and clap voces fidelium on the ﬁre before he goes so clear does he appear to sitting there between his candles in the room and the late night so ridiculous picture to my elderly wisdom does the fool present there was hurry then he now sees and there never was cause to hurry i repeat but how is this is then the great book written i am sure i know probably not human experience goes to show that the great book like the great american novel never gets written but that great story has been written is certain enough and one of the curious points about this story is its title it is not catriona nor is it kidnapped kidnapped is taking title and catriona beautiful in sound and suggestion of romance and kidnapped everyone knows is capital tale though imperfect and catriona the critics began to point out the day after its issue capital tale with an awkward ﬁssure midway in it it is the fate of sequels stevenson begins his to disappoint those who have waited them and it is possible that the boys of merry england who it may be remembered thought more of treasur island than of kidnapped will take but lukewarmly to catriona having had ﬁve years in which to forget its predecessor the title of the great story is the memoirs of david balfour

odyssey was not christened after penelope put kidnapped and catriona together within the same covers with one one dedication here will be the severest loss and one table of contents in which the

ship and having done this be so good to perceive how paltry are the objections you raised agains t the two volumes when you took them separately let raise again one or two of them 1 catriona is just two stories loosely hitched one of david vain attempt to save james stewart the other of the loves of david and catriona and in case the critic should be too stupid to detect this stevenson has been at the pains to divide his book into part and part ii now this which is real fault in book called catriona is fault at all in the memoirs of david balfour which by its very title claims to be constructed loosely in an odyssey the road taken by the wanderer is all the nexus required and the continuity of his presence if the author know his business is warrant enough the continuity of our interest in his adventures that the history of gil blas of santillane consists chieﬂy of episodes is not serious criticism upon lesage novel 2 in catriona more than few of the characters are suffered to drop out of sight just we have begun to take an interest in them there is rankeillor instance whose company in the concluding chapter of kidnapped was too good to be spared very easily and there is lady wonderfully clever portrait and captain tread moment on the verge of but are disappointed and balfour of pilrig and at the end of part away into darkness goes the lord advocate grange with his charming womenkind well if this be an objection to the tale it is one urged pretty often against life we scarce see enough of the men and women we like and here again that whic h may be fault in catriona is fault at all in the memoirs of david balfour though novelists may profess in everything they write to hold mirror up to life the reﬂection must needs be more artiﬁcial in small book than in large in the one very clearness they must isolate few human beings and cut off the currents so to speak bearing upon them from the outside world in the other with larger canvas they are able to deal with life more frankly were the odyssey cut down to one that of must round it off and have everyone on the stage and provided with his just portion of good and evil before we ring the curtain down it is nausicäa goes her way and it is barbara grant must go her way at the end of chapter xx and the pang we feel at parting with her is anything rather than reproach against the author 3 it is very certain the book stands that the reader must experience some shock of disappointment when after 200 pages of the most heroical endeavoring david fails in the end to save james stewart of the glens were the book concerned wholly with james stewart fate the cheat would be intolerable and great deal more than half of catriona points and trembles towards his fate like magnetic needle the cheat is pretty bad if we take catriona alone but once more if we are dealing with the memoirs of david balfour we bear steadily in mind that david balfour is our james disappointment is far more easily forgiven then and then only we get the right perspective of david attempt and recognize how inevitable was the issue when this stripling engaged to turn back the great forces of history it is more than lustre the dedication reminds us since david balfour at the end of the last chapter of kidnapped was left to kick his heels in the british linen company ofﬁce five years have knack of maki ng people ﬁve years older and the word y politic intrigue of catriona is at least ﬁve years older than the intrigue of kidnapped of the fashion of the vicomte bragelonne rather than of the three

but all that she is surprise she begins to be beautiful in chapter she kisses david hand with higher passion than the common kind of clay has any sense of and she is beautiful surprise to the end of the book the loves of these two make moving d yet not old and i pity the heart that is not tender catriona when she and david take their last walk together in leyden and the knocking of her little

men that you have been taking mean advantage of you have been looking it out in the lexicon the pleasant art of reasoning about literature on internal evidence suffers constant discouragement from the

entirely wrong within week you are set right by some fellow with parish register well but meanwhile you have been reading poetry and he has not only the uninstructed judge criticism by its results

and the ide faults may be found in these apart from the criticism that they are freaks in the development of stevenson genius nobody denies that they are splendid tales nobody i imagine can deny that they are tales of singular and original pattern yet reviewer praises them on their own merits or points out their own defects they are judged always in relation to stevenson previous work and the reviewers concentrate their censure upon the point that they are freaks in stevenson he is not continuing the public expected him to continue now there are number of esteemed novel ists about the land who earn comforta ble incomes by doing just what the public expects of them but of stevenson always something might have been predicted from the ﬁrst geniuspg 169 pg 170 pg 171 pg the project

partnership new set of experiments the considering that these what ever their faults are vast improvements on the black all those faults to the new partner but that is rough criticism moreover it is almost demonstrably false the weakness of the wrecker such it was lay in the paris and barbizon business and the author failure to make this of one piece with the main theme with the romantic histories of the curr ency lass and the flying scud but which of the two partners stands responsible this business stevenson beyond doubt if you shut your eyes to stevenson confessed familiarity with the paris and the barbizon of certain if you choose to deny that he wrote that chapter on fontainebleau in across the plains if you go on to deny that he wrote the opening of chapter xxi of the wrecker why then you are obliged to maintain that it was osbourne and not stevenson who wrote that famous chapter on the roussillon is absurd and if in spite of its absurdity you stick to this also

to attwater i own attwater beats osbou rne might say i have use that monstrous person i wish indeed osbourne had said so again i can not help feeling that the offence of attwater lies at stevenson door he strikes bad dream of general gordon out of the arabian nights you remember drawing of du maurier in punch wherein seizing upon locution of miss rhoda broughton he gave us group of magniﬁcently ugly men i seem to see attwater in that group but if stevenson is responsible attwater surely also he contributed the two splendid surprises of the story i am the more certain because they occur in the same chapter and within three pages of each other i mean of course captain davis sudden confession about his little adar and the equally startling discovery that the cargo of the farallone schooner supposed to be champagne is mostly water these are the two triumphant surprises of the book and i shall continue to believe that only one living man could have contrived them until somebody writes to samoa and obtains the assurance that they are among mr osbourne contributions to the tale two small complaints i have to make the ﬁrst is of the rather inartistically high level of profanity maintained by the speech of davis and huish it is natural enough of course but that is excuse if the frequency of the swearing prevent its making its proper impression in the right place and the name robert herrick bestowed on one of the three might have been shunned you may call an ordinary negro julius cæsar out of such extremes you get the legitimately grotesque but the robert herrick loose writer of the lovely hesperides and the robert herrick shameful haunter of papeete beach are not extremes and it was so very easy to avoid the association of ideas 22 in 173 pg 174 pg the project

an intimate journal these samoan letters to his friend sidney colvin form record scarcely interrupted of stevenson thinkings and doings from month to month and often from day to day during the last four romantic years of his life the ﬁrst is dated november 2nd 1890 when he and his household were clearing the ground their home on the of vaea the last october 6th 1894 just two months before his grave was dug on vaea top during his odyssey in the south seas from august 1888 to the spring of 1890 his letters to colvin at any rate were infrequent and tantalizingly vague but soon after settling on his estate in samoa he the ﬁrst time to my inﬁnite gratiﬁcation took to writing long and regular monthly budgets full and particular heart could wish and this practice he maintained until within few weeks of his death these letters occupying place quite apart in stevenson correspondence colvin has now edited with pious care and given to the 180 pg 181 pg 182 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https the great the happy surprise of the vailima letters is neither their continuity nor their fulness of on each of these points they surpass our hopes the great the entirely happy surprise is their intimacy we all could doubt it stevenson was clean and transparent mind but we scarcely allowed the innocent zest innocent because wholly devoid of vanity or selﬁshness which he took in observing its operations or the conﬁdence with which he held out the crystal his friend to gaze into one is at ﬁrst inclined to say that had these letters been less they had made less melancholy last few of them at any rate their editor says the tenor of these last letters of stevenson to and of others written to several of his friends at the same time seemed to give just cause anxiety indeed the reader will have perceived gradual change had during the past months been coming over the tone of his correspondence to judge by these letters his old invincible spirit of cheerfulness was beginning to give way to moods of depression and overstrained feeling although to those about him it seems his charming habitual sweetness and gaiety of temper were undiminished colvin is thinking doubt of passages such this from the very last letter i know i am at climacteric all men who live by their wits so i not despair but the truth is i am pretty nearly useless at literature were it not my health which made it impossible i could not ﬁnd it in my heart to forgive myself that i did not stick to an honest commonplace trade when i was young which might have now supported during these ill years but not suppose to be down in anything else only the nonce my skill deserts such it is or was it was very little dose of inspiration and pretty little

boys with these incipit et explicit my vogue i appeal to all who earn their living by pen or does not know moods such this who has not experience of those dark days when the ungrateful canvas refuses to come right and the artist sits down before it and calls himself fraud we may even say that these ﬁts of incapacity and blank despondency are part of the cost of all creative work they may be intensiﬁed by terror the family exchequer the day passes in strenuous but futile effort and the man asks himself what will happen to and mine if this kind of thing continues stevenson we are allowed to say the letters tell us did torment himself with these terrors and we may say further that by whatever causes impelled he certainly worked too hard during the last two years of his life with regard to the passage quoted what seems to really melancholy is not the baseless that is transitory malady most incident to authorship but that could magic carpet have transported stevenson at that moment to the side of the friend he he an hour or two have visited this apprehension had been at once dispelled he left england before achieving his full conquest of the public heart and the extent of that conquest he in his exile never quite realized when he visited sydney early in 1893 it was to him new and disconcerting not i fancy altogether digito monstrari or he puts it elsewhere to the affable celebrity nor i think he quite realized how large place he ﬁlled in the education in the affections of the younger barries and kiplings the weymans doyles and courses began after he had left these shores an artist gains much by working alone and away from chatter and criticism and adulation but his gain has this corresponding loss that he must go through his dark hours without support even master may take beneﬁt at it be only physical some closer and handier assurance than any letters can give of the place held by his work in the esteem of the boys we must not make too much of what he

colvin assurances the fragment on which he wroug ht during the last month of his life gives to my mind it did to his own the ﬁrst time the true measure of his powers and if in the literature of romance there is to be found work more masterly of more piercing human insight and more concentrated imaginative wisdom i not know it on the whole these letters from vailima give picture of serene

unless it were to bring you here and yet god knows perhaps this intercourse of writing serves well and i wonder were you here indeed would i commune so continually with the thought of you i say i wonder form i know and i know i should not in way the beauty of these letters is this that they tell us so much of stevens on that is new and nothing that is that we have difﬁculty in reconciling with the picture we had already formed in our own minds our mental portraits of some other writers drawn from their deliberate writings have had to be readjusted and sometimes most cruelly readjusted soon their private correspondence came to be published if any of us dreamed of this danger in stevenson case and i doubt if anyone did the danger at any rate is past the man of the letters is the man of the same gay eager strenuous lovable spirit curious ever about life and courageous ever in facing its chances profoundly he deplores the troubles in samoa when he hears that war has been declared he can hardly repress boyish excitement war is huge entraînement he writes in june 1893 there is other temptation to be compared to it not one we were all wet we had been ﬁve hours in the saddle mostly

life than the detonating débâcle the older genius saw life steadily and saw it whole matter how small the tale he draws curtain around it it stands in the midst of real world set in the white and composite light of day zola sees life in sections and by one or another of those colors into which daylight can be decomposed by the prism he is like man standing at the wings with limelight apparatus

interest geor ge moore reviewing la débâcle in the fortnightly last month laments this he reminds us of the splendid opportunity zola has ﬂung away in his latest work jean and maurice says moore have fought side by side they have alternately saved each other lives war has united them in bond of inseparable friendship they have grasped each other hands and looked in each other eyes overpowered with love that exceeds the love that woman ever gave to man now they are ranged on different sides armed one against the other the idea is ﬁne one and it is to be deeply regretted that zola did not throw history to the winds and develop the beautiful human story of the division of friends in civil war never would history have tempted balzac away from the human passion of such subject but it is just ﬁdelity to the human interest of every subject that gives the novelist his rank that take another insta page or two of balzac when balzac is dealing with money of more value than the whole of of burke it has been said by critic with whom it is pleasure once in way to agree that he knew how the whole world lived it was burke peculiarity and his glory to apply the imagination of poet of the ﬁrst order to the facts and business of life burke imagination led him to look over the whole land the legislator devising new laws the judge expounding and enforcing old ones the merchant despatching all his goods and extending his credit the banker advancing the money of his customers upon the credit of the merchant the frugal man slowly accumulating the store which is to support him in old age the ancient institutions of church and university with their seemly provisions sound learning and true religion the parson in his pulpit the poet pondering his rhymes the farmer eyeing his crops the painter covering his canvases the player educating the feelings burke saw all this with the fancy of poet and dwelt on it with the eye of lover now all this which is true of burke is true of the very ﬁrst literary shakespeare and balzac all this and they not only see all this immense activity of life but the emotions that animate each of the myriad actors suppose them to treat of commerce they see not only the goods and money changing hands but the ambitions dangers fears delights the ﬁerce adventures by desert and seas the slow toil at home upon which the foundations of commerce are set like

home moore speaks of zola vast imagination it is vast in the sense that it sees one thing at time and sees it thousand times big it appears to most men but can the imagination that sees whole world

transi tions what crooked reasons what lame conclusions how little is made out and that little how ill yet they are the best i can nevertheless play of shakespeare or painting by reynolds or an essay by hazlitt imperfect though it be is of more rarity and worth than the correctest juggling or rope walking hazlitt proceeds to exami ne why this should be and discovers number of good reasons but there is one reason omitted by him or perhaps left the reader to infer on which we may proﬁtably spend few minutes it forms part of big subject and tempts to much abstract talk on the universality of the fine arts but i think we shall be putting it simply enough if we say that an artist is superior to an artiste becaus he does well what people in hundred are doing poorly all their lives 197 pg 198 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https people compare ﬁction with real life they start with asserting real life to be conglomerate of innumerable details of all possible degrees of pertinence and importance and go on to show that the novelist selects from this mass those which are the most important and pertinent to his purpose i speak here particularly of the novelist but the same is alleged of all practition ers of the ﬁne arts and in way this is true enough but who unless in an idle moment or with view to writing treatise in metaphysics ever takes this view of the world who regards it conglomerate of innumerable details critics say that the artist difﬁculty lies in selecting the details proper to his purpose and his justiﬁcation rests on the selection he makes but where lives the man whose difﬁculty and whose justiﬁcation not lie just here is not consciously or unconsciously selecting from morning until night you take the most ordinary country walk how many millions of leaves and stones and blades of grass you pass without perceiving them at all how many thousands of others you perceive and at once allow to slip into oblivion suppose you have walked four miles with the express object of taking pleasure in country sights i dare wager the objects that have actually engaged your attention two seconds are less than ﬁve hundred and those that remain in your memory when you reach home few dozen all the way you have been quite unconsciously selecting and rejecting and it is the brain bedazzlement over this work i suggest and not merely the rhythmical physical exertion that lulls the more ambitious walker and induces that phleg matic mood so prettily described by the mood in which we can think of this or that lightly or laughingly child thinks or we think in morning doze we can make puns or puzzle out acrostics and triﬂe in thousand ways with words and rhymes but when it comes to honest work when we come to gather ourselves together an effort we may sound the trumpet long and loud we please the great barons of the mind will not rally to the standard but sit each one at home warming his hands over his own ﬁre and brooding on his own private thought again certain critics never seem tired of pelting the novelist with comparisons drawn between painting and photography ﬁdelity to life suggests the camera rather than the brush and palette and the implication is that and the camera resemble each other in their tendency to reproduce irrelevant detail the camera it is assumed repeats this irrelevant detail the photographer does not select but is this true i have known many enthusiasts in photography whose enthusiasm i could not share but i never knew one even among amateurs who wished to photograph everything he saw from every possible point of view even the amateur rule still he selects the mere act of setting up camera in any particular spot implies process of selection and when the deed is done the scenery has been libelled our eyes behold the photograph and go through another process of selection in short whatever they look upon men and women are selecting ceaselessly the artist therefore does well and consciously and particular end what every man or woman does poorly and unconscious ly and casually he differs in the photographer in that he has more licence to eliminate when once the camera is set up it owner power over the landscape has come to an end the person who looks on the resultant photograph must go through the same process of choosing and rejecting that he would have gone through in contemplating the natural landscape the sole advantage is that the point of view has been selected him and that he can enjoy it without fatigue in any place and at any time the truth seems to be that the huma n brain abhors the apparently aimless nature and real life and is ever trying to get away from it by selecting this and ignoring that and it contrives so well that i suppose the average man is not consciously aware twice year of that conglomerate of details which the critics call real life he holds one stout thread at any rate to guide him through the thread of 200 pg 201 pg 202 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https justiﬁcation of the poet or the novelist is that he discovers better thread he follows up universal where the average man follows only particular but in follow ing it he does but use those processes by which the average man arrives or attempts to arrive at pleasure externals 18 story and anecdote i suppose i am more favored than most people who write stories in receiv ing from unknown correspondents variety of suggestions outlines of plots sketches of situations characters and so forth one can not but feel grateful all this spontaneous beneﬁcence the mischief is that in cases out of hundred the fraction is really much smaller these suggestions are of possible use why should this be put brieﬂy the reason is that story differs from an anecdote i take the ﬁrst two instances that come into my head but they happen to be striking ones and they occur in book of kipling are safe to be well known to all my correspondents in kipling fascinating book life handicap on greenhow hill is story the lang men larut is an anecdote on greenhow hill is founded on study of the human heart and it is upon the human heart that the tale constrains one interest the lang men larut is just yarn spun the yarn sake it informs us of nothing and is closely related if i may use some of howells expressive language the occasion to the lies swapped between men after the ladies have left the table and the reason why the when will happen at times his invention runs dry can take comfort in the generous outpourings of his unknown friends is just the plots are merely plots and the anecdotes merely anecdotes and the difference between these and story that shall reveal something concerning men and women is just the difference between bad and good art let us go step further at ﬁrst sight it seems superﬂuous contention that novelist rank depends upon what he can see and what he can tell us of the human heart but matter of fact you will ﬁnd that at least of contemporary criticism is devoted to matters quite what i will call externals or the accidents of and that consequence our novelists are spending quite unreasonable proportion of their labor upon externals i wrote consequence hastily because it is always easier to blame the critics if the truth were known i dare say the novelists began it with their talk about documents the scientiﬁc method observation and experiment and the like the fallacy of documents now you may observe man until you are tired and then you may begin and observe him over again you may photograph him and his surroundings you may spend years in studying what he eats and drinks you may search out what his uncles died of and the price he pays his hats nothing at all about him at least you may know enough to insure his life or assess him income tax but you are not even towards writing novel about him you are still groping among externals his unspoken ambitions the stories he tells himself silently at midnight in his bed the pain he masks with dull face and the ridiculous fancie s he hugs in are the essen tials and you can not get them by observation if you can discover these you are nove list born if not you may well shut up your and turn to some more remunerative trade you will never surprise the secret of soul by

intimately acquainted with the country in which he lays his scene but none the less the study of local color is not of the ﬁrst importance and the critic who lavishes praise upon writer introducing us to an entirely new atmosphere breaking new ground and wafting us to scenes with which the jaded is scarcely acquainted and giving us work which bears every trace of minute local research is praising that which is of secondary importance the works of richard jefferies form considerable museum of externals of one particular kind and this is possibly the reason why the cockney novelist waxes eloquent over richard jefferies he can now import the breath of the ﬁeld into his works at greater expense of time and trouble than taking down the gamekeeper at home from his club bookshelf and perusing chapter or so before settling down to work there is not the slightest harm in his doing this the mistake lies in thinking local color however acquired of the ﬁrst importance in judging ﬁction there is probably safer rule than to ask one self how far does the pleasure excited in by this book depend upon the transitory and trivial accidents that distinguish this time this place this character from another time another place another character and how far upon the abiding elements of human life the constant temptations the constant ambitions and the constant nobility and weakness of the human heart these are the essentials and amount of documents or local color can ﬁll their room 30 the country copy the case of certain small volume of verse in which i take some interest and its treatment at the hands of the reviewers seems to to illustrate in sufﬁciently amusing manner trick that the british critic has been picking up of late in short account of hosken the postman poet written by way of preface to his verses by the way methuen i took occasion to point out that he is not what is called in the jargon of these days that his poetic bent inclines rather to meditation than to description and that though his early struggles in london and elsewhere have made him acquainted with many strange people in abnormal conditions of life his interest has always lain not in these striking anomalies but in the destiny of humanity whole and its position in the great scheme of things these are simple facts i found them easily enough in hosken anybody else may ﬁnd them they also seem to to be critic purpose ultimate facts it is an ultimate fact that publius virgilius maro wore his buskins somewh at higher in the heel than did quintus horatius flaccus and critic to my knowledge has been impertinent enough to point out that since horace had some experience of the tented ﬁeld while virgil was courtier therefore horace should have essayed to tell the martial exploits of trojan and rutulian while virgil contented himself with the gossip of the via sacra compare small things with is the mistake into which our critics have fallen in hosken case and i mention it because the case is typical they try to get behind the ultimate facts and busy themselves with questions they have proper concern with some ask petulantly why hosken is not poet some are gravely concerned that local talent the talent of man who happens to dwell in some locality other than the critic should not concern itself with local af fairs and remind to thine orchard edge belong all the

himself with greek mythology and the answer is that each has perfect right to follow his own bent the assumption of many critics that only within the metropolitan cab radius can comprehensive system of philosophy be constructed and that only through the glass windows of two or three clubs is it possible to see life steadily and see it whole is one that i have before now had occasion to dispute it is joined in this case to another yet more from brief survey of an author circumstances we can dictate to him what he ought to write about and how he ought to write it and i have observed particularly that if writer be countryman or at all well acquain ted with country life all kinds of odd entertainment is expected of him in the way of notes on the habits of birds beasts and ﬁshes on the growth of all kinds of common plants on the proper way to make hay to milk cow and so forth richard jef feries now it is just the true countryman who would more think of noting these things down in book than londoner would think of stating in novel that bond street joins oxford street and piccadilly simply because they have been familiar to him from boyhood and to my mind it is small but signiﬁcant sign of rather lamentable none other indeed than the rural exodus political economists call each and every novelist of my acquaintance while assuming matter of course that his readers are tolerably

strong part in current ﬁction the thing may possibly be overdone looking at it from the artistic point of view dispassionately i may i think we are overdoing it but that the moment is not the point of

gentleman who ﬁfty or hundred years hence will be surveying us and our think we shall ﬁnd this elaboration of locality in ﬁction to be but ack of the pendulum natural revolt from the work of the novelist who takes the whole world his province and imagines he sees life steadily and sees it whole when he has seen great deal of it superﬁcially the still lingers among us we know him with his tourist return ticket and the plot in his head and his and pencil jotting down local color we still ﬁnd him working up the scenery of bolivia in the reading room of the british museum but he is going rapidly out of fashion and it is well to put his features on record and them if only that we may recog nize him on that day when the pendulum shall swing him triumphantly back into our midst and locality shall in its turn pass out of vogue i submit this simile of the pendulum with some difﬁdence to those eager theorists who had rather believe that their art is advancing steadily but at fair rate of speed towards perfection my own less not altogether cheerless that the various fashions in art swing to and fro upon intersecting curves some of the points of intersection are fortunate are obviously the reverse and gene rally the fortunate points lie near the middle of each arc or the mean while the less fortunate ones lie towards the ends that is towards excess upon one side or another i have already said that in the amount of attention they pay to locality just now the novelists seem to be running into excess if i must choose between one excess and the the and the writer of each at

to feel the loss of them and recognize their scientiﬁc and romantic value and that number of writers entered into struggle again st time and the to study these differences and place them upon record before all trace of them should disappear and then i believe our historian though he may ﬁnd that in 1894 we paid too much attention to the minutiæ of dialect and ethnic differences and were inclined to overlay with these the more catholic principles of human conduct will acknowledge that in our hour we did the work that was most urgent our hour doubt is not the happiest but since this is the work

phrases in parabolic curves over the target but slight wildness of aim is easily corrected and to see the target at all is more conspicuous merit than the public imagines now parker sees his target

probably persecute in his own age his is voice crying in the wilderness in the wilderness he speeds the viewless arrows of his thought which ﬂy far and take root they strike earth and blossom and so truth multiplies and in the end most likely after his death the typical poet comes by his own such is the popular conception of the typical poet and i observe that it fascinates even educated people i have in mind the recent unveiling of onslow ford shelley memorial at university college oxford those who assisted at that ceremony were the most part men and women of high culture excesses such affable members of parliament commit when distributing school prizes or opening free public libraries were clearly out of the question yet even here and almost within the shadow of bodley great

comic contemporaries and the disdain of his misfortunes incident to the most respe ctable pindar and virgil were court favorites repaying their patrons in golden song dante indeed suffered banishment

heights of thought he was capable of to the end his thought remained inferior to his style and to the end the two in him were separable whereas in poets of the very ﬁrst rank they are inseparable but that towards the end his style lifted his thought to heights of which even in memoriam gave promise can not i think be questioned by any student of his collected works tennyson belongs if ever poet

that he attained the glorious manner of seasons return but not to returns day or the sweet approach of even or morn so on to be short it was not at the age of or thereabouts he deliberately proposed

through fayre vineyard at the ﬁrst give you cluster of grapes that full of that taste you may long to passe further he beginneth not with obscure deﬁnitions which must blur the margent with interpretations and load the memory with doubtfulnesse but he cometh to you with words set in delightful proportion either accompanied with or prepared the well inchanting skill of musicke and with

nature an upholder and preserver carrying everywhere with him relationship and love in spite of difference of soil and climate of language and manners of laws and customs in spite of things silently gone out of mind and things violently destr oyed the poet binds together by passion and knowledge the vast empire of human society it is spread over the whole earth and over all time it is wordsworth

quotes tasso proud non c è in mondo chi merita nome di creatore non iddio ed il poeta and himself says the jury which sits in judgment upon poet belonging he does to all time must be composed of his peers it must be impanelled by time from the selectest of the wise of many generations sidney exalts the poet above the historian and the philosopher and coleridge asserts that man was ever yet great poet without being at the same time profound philosopher ben jonson puts it characteristically every beggarly corporation affords the state mayor or two bailif fs yearly but solus rex aut poeta non quotannis nascitur the longer one lives the more cause one ﬁnds to rejoice that different men have dif ferent ways of saying the same thing inspiration not improvisation the agreement of all these poets on some other matters is more remarkable most of them claim inspiration the great practitioners of their art but wonderful is the unanimity with which they dissociate this from improvisation they are sticklers the rules of the game the poet does not pour his full heart in profuse strains of unpremeditated art on the contrary his rapture is the sudde n result of long premeditation the ﬁrst and most conspicuous lesson of this volume seems to be that poetry is an art and therefore has rules next after this one is struck with the carefulness with which these practitioners when it comes to theory stick to their aristotle poetry not mere metrical composition instance they are practically unanim ous in accepting aristotle contention that it is not the metrical form that makes the poem verse says sidney is an orname nt and cause to poetry since there have been many most excellent poets that never versiﬁed and now swarm many versiﬁers that need never answer to the name of poets wordsworth apologizes using the word poetry synonymous with metrical compositio much confusion he says has been introd uced into criticism by this contradisti nction of poetry and prose instead of the more philosophical one of poetry and matter of fact or science the only strict antithesis to prose is metre nor is this in truth strict antithesis because lines and passages of metre so naturally occur in writing prose that it would be scarcely possible to avoid them even were it desirable and it is by means essential that poet should accom modate his language to this traditional form so that the harmony which is its spirit be observed the distinction between poets and prose writers is vulgar error shelley goes on to instance plato and bacon true poets though they wrote in prose the popular division into prose and verse he repeats is inadmissible in accurate philosophy its philosophic function then again upon what wordsworth calls the more philosophical distinction between poetry and matter of of course the famous φιλοσοφώτερον καὶ σπουδαιότερον passage in the poetics is wonderful with what hearty consent our poets pounce upon this passage and paraphrase it and expand it the great justiﬁcation of their art which indeed it is sidney gives the passage at length wordsworth writes aristotle i have been told hath said that poetry is the most philosophic of all writings it is so coleridge quotes sir john davies who wrote of poesy surely with an eye on the poetics from their gross matter she abstracts their forms and draws kind of quintessence from things which to her proper nature she transforms to bear them light on her celestial wings thus does she when from individual statespg 250 pg 251 pg 252 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir

heart of the public i observe that our hoary friend the great heart of the public has been taking his annual outing in september thanks to the german emperor and the new head of the house of orleans he has had the opportunity of stroll through the public press arm in arm with his old crony and adversary the divine right of kings and the two have gone once more by the light of the moon to drop tear perchance on the graves of the thin end of the wedge and the stake in the country you know the unhappy story how the wedge drove its thin end into the stake with fatal results and how it died of remorse and was buried at the with the stake in its inside it is pathetic tale and the great heart of the public can always be trusted to discriminate true pathos from false miss marie corelli opinion of it it was burgin in the september number of the idler who let the great heart loose this i am sure burgin when he thinks himself he usually does writes sound sense and capital english but in the service of journalism burgin called on miss marie corelli the authoress of barabbas and asked what she thought of the value of criticism miss corelli idealised the subject by the poeti c manner in which she mingled tea and criticism together she i think authors not sufﬁciently bear in mind the important fact that in this age of ours the public thinks itself much more extensively than we give it credit it is cultured public and its great brain is fully capable of deciding things it rather objects to be treated like child and told to read and what to avoid and moreover we must not fail to note that it mistrusts criticism generally and seldom reads and why simply it is perfectly aware instance that theodore watts is logroller to swinburne that le gallienne greatly norman gale and that andrew lang tumbles his logs along over everything many his humour ﬁts know the proportion of tea to criticism in all this but miss corelli can hardly be said to idealise the subject here the public is the supreme critic and though it does not write in the quarterly or the nineteenth century it thinks and talks independently of everything and everybody and on its thought and word alone depends the fate of any piece of literature hall caine v 254 pg 255 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https burgin called on hall caine who had just ﬁnished breakfast hall caine gave reasons which compelled him to believe that good or bad criticism is tremendous force but he too confessed that in his opinion the public is the ultimate critic it often happens that the public takes books on trust from the professed guides of literature but if the books are not right it drops them and he proceeded to make an observation with which we may most cordially agree i am feeling he said increasingly day by day that rightness in imaginative writing is more important than subject or style or anything else if story is right in its theme and the evolution of its theme it will live if it is not right it will die whatever its secondary literary qualities in what sense the public is the ultimate critic i say that we may agree with this most cordially and it need not cost us much to own that the public is the ultimate critic if we mean more than this that since the public holds the purse it rests ultimately with the public to buy or neglect to buy an author books that surely is obvious enough without the aid of ﬁne language but if hall caine mean that the public without instruction from its betters is the best judge of book if he consent with miss corelli that the general public is cultured public with great brain and by the exercise of that great brain approves itself an infallible judge of the rightness or wrongness of book then i would respectfully ask evidence the poets and critics of his time united in praising campion writer of lyrics the great brain and heart of the public neglected him utterly three centuries then scholar and critic arose and persuaded the public that campion was great lyrical writer and now the public accepts him such shall we say then the great heart of the public is the ultimate judge of campion lyrics perhaps but we might well praise his cleanliness boy who has been held under the pump when martin farquhar tupper wrote the great heart of the public expanded towards him at once the public bought his effusions by tens of thousands gradually the small voice of skilled criticism made itself heard and the public grew ashamed of itself and at length laughed at tupper shall we then call the public the ultimate judge of tupper perhaps but we might well praise the continence of man who turns in disgust from drink on the morning after drunken ﬁt what is the public the proposition that the man in the street is better judge of literature than the the man who knows little than the man who knows to my mind at least slightly imbecile air on the face of it it also appears to that people are either confusing thought or misusing language when they confer the title of supreme critic on the last person to be persuaded and again what is the public i gather that miss corelli story of barabbas has had an immense popular success but so i believe has the deadwood dick series of penny dreadfuls and the gifted author of deadwood dick may console himself i daresay he does the neglect of the critics by the thought that the great brain b of the public is the supreme judge of literature but obviously he and miss corelli will not have the same public in their mind if the great brain of the public we substitute the great brain of that part of the public which subscribes to mudie we may lose something of impressiveness but we shall at least know what we are talking about june 17 mr gosse v iew

anything of the kind be there her poetry has been one of england divinest treasures but of her population very few understand it and the shrine has always been guarded by the elect who happen to possess in varying degrees certain qualities of mind and ear it is gosse puts it by sustained effort of bluff on the part of these elect that english poetry is kept upon its high pedestal of honor the worship of it one of the glories of our birth and state is imposed upon the masses by small aristocracy of intelligence and taste gissing t estimony what the masses care poetry in an appendix gosse prints letter from geor ge gissing who everyone knows has studied the popular mind assiduously and with startling results here are few sentences from his letter 1 after ﬁfteen years observation of the poorer classes of english folk chieﬂy in london and the south i am pretty well assured that whatever civilising agencies may be at work among the democracy poetry is not one of them 2 the custodian of free library in southern city informs that once in month does volume of verse pass over his counter that the exceptional applicant seeking byron or longfellow is generally wife of tradesman and that an offer of verse to man or woman who comes simply book is invariably rejected wo even look at it 3 it was needless folly to pretend that because one or two of tennyson poems became largely known through popular recitation therefore tennyson was dear to the heart of the people subject of their pride whilst he lived of their mourning when he died my point is that poet holds this place in the esteem of the english lower orders 4 some days before the funeral i was sitting in public room where two men retired shopkeepers exchanged an occasional word they read the morning news great deal here about lord tennyson said one the was signiﬁcant i listened anxiou sly his companion reply yes the man moved uneasily and added at once you think about this ride in that room i frequented it on successive days with this object not syllable did i hear regarding tennyson save the sentence faithfully recorded poetry not beloved by any one 262 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https gissing be it observed speaks only of the class which he has studied but in talking of demos or more loosely of democracy we must be careful not to limit these terms to the lower and lower classes poetry who draws her priests and warders from all classes of society is generally beloved of none the average country magnate the average church dignitary the average professional man the average commer cial all these she is alike unknown at least the insensibility of each is differentiated by shades so ﬁne that we need not trouble ourselves to make distin

after hearing the news of browning death i stopped an acquaintance in the street professional man of charming manner and repeated it to him he stared moment and then murmured that he was sorry to hear it clearly he did not wish to hurt my feelings by confessing that he had the vaguest idea who browning might be and if anybody think this an extreme case let him turn to the daily papers and read the names of those who were at newmark et on that same afternoon when our great poet was laid in the abbey with every pretence of national grief the pursuit of one horse by another is doubtless more elevating spectacle than the pursuit of ﬂea by but on that afternoon even tepid lover of letters must have found an equal incongruity in both entertainments i not say that the general public hates poetry but i say that those who care about it are few and those who know about it are fewer nor these assert their right of interference often they might just once or twice in the last ten or ﬁfteen years they have pulled up some exceptionally coarse weed on which the general public had every disposition to graze and have pitched it over the hedge to lethe wharf to root itself and fatten there and terrible those of polydorus have been the shrieks of the avulsed root but rule they have sat and piped upon the stile and considered the good cow grazing conﬁdent that in the end she must bite of f more than she can chew the outsiders still the aristocracy of letters exists and in it if nowhere else titles social advantages and commercial success alike count nothing while royalty itself sits in the court of the gentiles and i am afraid we must include in the crowd not only those affable politicians who from time to time open public library and oblige us with their views upon literature little realizing what hecuba is to them and still less what they are to hecuba but also those affable teach ers of religion philosophy and science who condescend occasionally to amble through the garden of the muses and rearrange its labels us while drawing our attention to the rapid deterioration of the ﬂowerbeds the author of the citizen of the world once compared the profession of letters

expressed myself exactly it is impossible to work up any enthusiasm the service done to literature by criticism whole i have doubt the unenviable advantage over you of having wasted three mortal months in reading all the literary criticism extant of the ﬁrst quarter of this century it would be difﬁcult to express my sense of its imbecility its blundering and its bad passions but the good books it assailed are not lost and the bad ones it gloriﬁed not survive it is not that the public has been the better judge but that good work has the seeds of life while bad work carries with it the seeds of dissolution this is the key to the story of wordsworth on the one hand and to the story of tupper on the other tupperpg 264 pg 265 pg 266 the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in

mockery ﬁve hundred james hannays would not have brought it down the truth is that it is not the who knows or the public which does not know that determines the ultimate fate of immediate fate they may both inﬂuence the book must that itself if it is right it lives if it is wrong it dies and the critic who neglected poet is merely articulating the growing sense there have always been few good critics thank god but the ﬁnest critic is the untutored sentiment of the public not of or or the next day but of all days sentiment which tells if thing is right or wrong by holding on to it or letting it drop of course i agree that book must ultimately depend its fate upon its own qualities but when hall caine talks of growing sense i ask in whom does this sense ﬁrst grow and i answer in the cultured few who enforce it upon the in this very case of wordsworth and i hold the credit of the result apart from the author share belongs rather to those few persistent advocates than to those judges who are only ultimate in the sense that they are the last to be convinced if the reader object that i am using the great heart and great brain of the public interchangeable terms i would refer

of grant allen book and we are more and more conﬁ rmed in the belief that its inﬂuence has been and is most pernicious grant allen is not much heard of in ireland and the laudations you pronounce on him writer so far we know him appear wholly unmerited at any rate he appears in your review the advocate free love and it seems to us strange that you should place his work in the exaggerated importance of book of the month accompanied by eighteen pages of comment and quotation in which there is publicity given to the work out of all proportion to its merits i not doubt that the topic of free love engages the attention of the corrupt londoner there are plenty of such persons who are only too glad to get the sanction of writers the maintenance and practice of their evil thoughts but the purest and best lives in all parts of the ﬁeld of christian philanthropy will mourn the publicity you have given to this evil book it is not even improbable that the perusal of grant allen book which you have lifted into importance book of the month may determine the action of souls to their spiritual ruin the problem of indirect inﬂuence is full of mystery but the hour of our departure

modiﬁed upon perusal of letter received by stead from james of 18 cope street dublin and printed in the westminster gazette of march 11th mr writes eason in t wo attitudes dear s ir following may interest you and your readers i was subscriber to the library owned by eason limited and in december asked them napoleon and the fair sex by masson the librarian informed eason had decided not to circulate it it contained improper details which eason considered immoral copy was also refused to one of the pressmen in dublin man of mature years and experience three days afterwards i saw young man ask the librarian the same book and eason manager presented it to him with low bow i remarked on this circumstance to charles eason who told that he had issued it to this one subscriber only because he was prince francis of teck i told him it was likely from the description he had given of it to be more injurious to young man such prince francis of teck than to but he replied these people are differ ent besides they are so inﬂuential we can not refuse them however if you wish you can now have the book i told eason that i did not wish to read it ever since he had told when i ﬁrst applied it that it was quite improper the two excuses produced by eason not agree very well together the ﬁrst gives us to understand that in eason opinion ordinary moral principles can not be applied to persons of royal blood the second gives us to understand that though in eason opinion ordinary moral principles can be applied to princes the application would involve more risk than eason cares to undertake each of his excuses taken apart is intelligible enough taken together they can hardly be called consistent but the effects of royal and splendor upon the moral eyesight are well known and need not be dwelt on here after all what concerns us is not eason attitude towards prince francis of teck but eason attitude towards the reading public and in this respect from one point of happens to be his eason attitude seems to irreproachable he is clearly alive to his responsibility and is honestly concerne d that the goods he purveys to the public shall be goods of which his conscience approve here is grocer who sands his sugar before hurrying to family prayer here is man who carries his religion into his business and stakes his honor on the purity of his wares i think it would be wrong in the extreme to deride eason action in the matter of the woman who did and stead review he is doing his best stead cheerfully allows the reasonable objection to bookstall censorship but i said above he is doing his best under circumstances he imperfectly understands let add here in position which is unfair to him that eason imperfectly understands his position will be plain i think to anyone who studies his reply to stead but let make the point clear it is the crucial point in the discussion of thepg 271 pg 272 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https bookstall censorship great deal may be said against setting up censorship of literature great deal may be said in favor of censorship but if censorship there must be the censor should be deliberately chosen his ofﬁce and in exercising his power should be directly responsible to the public conscience if censorship there must be let the community choose man whose qualiﬁcations have been weighed man in whose judgment it decides that it can rely but that tom or dick or harry or tom dick harry limited by the process of collaring commercial monopoly from the railway companies should be exalted into the supreme arbiters of what men or women may or may not be allowed to surely is unjustiﬁable by any argument eason may on the whole be doing more good than harm he is plainly very meaning man of business if he knows good book from the public has reason to suppose that he can very well believe that when his moral and literary judgment came into conﬂict with his business interests he would sacriﬁce his business interests but the interests of good literature and proﬁtable business can not always be identi cal and whenever they conﬂict they put eason into false position managing director of eason son he must consider his shareholders supreme arbiter of letters he stands directly answerable to the public conscience i protest therefore that these functions should never be combined in one man readers of the s peaker know i range myself on the side of those who would have literature free but even our opponents who desire control must desire form of control such reason approves the poor little penny dreadful 5 our crusaders the poor little penny dreadful has been catching it once more once more the british press has stripped to its massive waist and solemnly squared up to this hardened young offender it calls this remarkable performance crusade i like these crusades they remind one of that merry passage in pickwick 254 in the ﬁrst edition whether winkle was seized with temporary attack of that species of insanity which originates in sense of injury or animated by this display of weller valour is uncertain but certain it is that he sooner saw grummer fall

not be well to inquire triﬂe more deeply into cause and effect in the ﬁrst place matricide is so utterly unnatural crime that there must be something abominably peculiar in form of literature that persuades to it but year or two back on the occasion of former crusade i took the pains to study considerable number of penny dreadfuls my reading embraced all those believe i am right in saying were reviewed few days back in the daily chronicle and some others i give you my word i could ﬁnd nothing peculiar about them they were even rather ostentatiously on the side of virtue the bloodshed in them it would not compare with that in many of the adventure stories at that time read so eagerly by boys of the middle and upper classes the style was ridiculous of course but bad style excites nobody but reviewer and does not even excite him to deeds of the kind we are now trying to account the reviewer in the daily chronicle thinks worse of these books than i but he certainly failed to quote anyth ing from them that by the wildest fancy could be interpreted sanctioning such crime matricide the cause to be sought in the boy rather than in the book let us moment turn our attention from the penny dreadful to the from the éponge á laver les cabriolets to notre pauvr humanité speak quite it is well known to every doctor and every schoolmaster and should be known if it is not to every parent that all boys sooner or later pass through crisis in growth during which absolutely nothing can be predic ted of their behavior at such times honest boys have given way to lying and theft gentle boys have developed an unexpected savagery ordinary the small g urchins whom we know fallen into morbid brooding upon unhealthy subjects in the immense majority of cases the crisis is soon over and the boy is himself again but while it lasts the disease will draw its sustenance from all manner of it may be in themselves quite innocent i avoid particularizing many reasons but any observant doctor will conﬁrm what i have said now the moderately afﬂuent boy who reads stories of adventure has many advantages at this period over the poor boy who reads penny dreadfuls to begin with the crisis has tendency to attack him later secondly he meets it fortiﬁed by better training and more deﬁnite ideas of the difference between right and wrong virtue and vice thirdly and this is very important he is probably under school discipline at the means that he is to some extent watched and shielded when i think of these advantages i frankly confess that the difference in the literature

indeed it is not possible to name any book out of which perverted mind will not draw food its disease the whole fallacy lies in supposing literature the cause of the disease evil men are not evil because they read bad books they read bad book s because they are evil and being evil or diseased they are quickly able to extract evil or disease even from very good books there is talk of disseminating the works of our best authors at cheap rate in the hope that they will drive the penny dreadful out of the market but has good literature at the cheapest driven the middle classes from their false gods and let it be remembered to the credit of these poor boys that they buy their books the middle classes take their poison on hire or exchange but perhaps the full enormity of the cant

in the least absurd because the story rests on problems which are neither old nor new but eternal and on emotions which are neither older nor newer than the breast of man to be sure the true devotee of ibsen will not be content with this you will be told by herr jaeger ibsen biographer that peer gynt is an attack on norwegian romanticism the poem by the way is romantic to the romantic indeed that

ethical problem the main ethical problem of the poem is what is self and how shall man be himself wicksteed puts it in his four lectures on henrik ibsen what is it to be one self god meant something when he made each one of us man to embody that meaning of god in his words and deeds and so become in degree word of god made ﬂesh is to be himself but thus to be himself he must slay himself that is to say he must slay the craving to make himself the centre round which otherspg 289 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https and must strive to ﬁnd his true

you have it the devil has stancher ally than want of per ception and its solution this is fair statement of ibsen proble m and his solution of it in the poem he solves it by the aid of two characters two diagra ms we may say diagram is peer gynt man who is always striving to make himself the centre round which others revolve who never sacriﬁces his self generously anothe r good nor surrenders it to decided course of action diagram ii is solveig woman who has dread of who surrenders self and is in short peer perfect antithesis when peer is an outlaw she forsakes all and follows him to his hut in the forest peer deserts her and roams the world where he ﬁnds his theory of self upset by one adventure after another and at last reduced to absurdity in the madhouse at cairo but though his own theory is discredited he has not yet found the true one to ﬁnd this he must be brought face to face in the last scene with his deserted wife there the ﬁrst time he asks the question and receives the answer where he asks has peer gynt true self been since we parted where was i myself the whole man the true man where was i with god sigil upon my brow and solveig answers in my faith in my hope in my love in these words we have the main ethical problem solved and peer perception of the truth vide wicksteed remarks quoted abov is the one necessary climax of the poem we not care least i not care peer escape the or not it may be too late him or there may be yet time to live another life but whatever the case may be it does alter what ibsen set out to prove the problem which ibsen shirks if indeed he does shirk it is subsidiary rider so to speak can solveig by her love redeem peer gynt can the woman save the man soul will she after all cheat the of his victim the poet by giving solveig the last word seems to think it possible according to archer the ibsen of would know it to be impossible he knows none better that man can save his brother soul or pay his brother debt nor women neither adds mr archer is peer redemption romantic fallacy but is this so peer gynt was published in i turn to doll house written twelve years later and i ﬁnd there woman preparing to redeem man just solveig prepares to redeem peer i ﬁnd in archer translation of that play the following page of dialogue linden there happiness in working oneself nils give somebody and something to work krogstad that

better self with you i fear nothing ibsen hopes of enfranchised women again we are not told if linden experiment is successful but ibsen certainly gives hint that she is likely to fail this was in in 1885 ibsen paid visit to norway and made speech to some workingmen at drontheim in which this passage occurred democracy by itself can not solve the social question we must introduce an aristocratic element into our life i am not referring of course to an aristocracy of birth or of purse or even of intellect i mean an aristocracy of character of will of mind that alone can make us free from two classes will this aristocracy i desire come to from our women and our workmen the social revolution now prepari ng in europe is chieﬂy concerned with the future of the workers and the women on this i set all my hopes and expectations i think it would be easy to multiply instances showing that though ibsen may hold that man can save his brother soul he does not extend this disability to women but hopes and believes on the contrary that women will redeem mankind on men he builds little hope to speak roughly men are all in peer gynt case or torvald helmer they are swathed in timid conventions blindfolded with selﬁshness so that they can not perceive and unable with their own hands to tear off these bandages they are incapable of the highest renunciation man says torvald helmer sacriﬁces his honor even one he loves those who heard miss achurch deliver nora reply will not easily forget it millions of women have done so the effect in the theatre was tremendous this sentence clinched the whole play millions of women are like solveig capable of renouncing all love of surrendering self altogether and i read ibsen it is precisely on this power of renunciation that he builds his hope of man redemption so that unless i err greatly the scene in peer gynt which archer calls shirking of the ethical problem is just the solution which ibsen has been persistent in presenting to the world let it be understood of course that it is only your solveigs and lindens who can thus save brother soul women who have made their own way in the world thinking themselves working themselves freed from the conventions which man would impose on them i know archer will not retort on with nora who leaves her husband and children and claims that her ﬁrst duty is to herself nora is just the woman who can not redeem man her doll house training is the very opposite of solveig and linden she is silly girl brought up amid conventions and awakened by one blow to the responsibilities of life that she should at once know the right course to take would be incredible in real life and impossible in play the action of which has been evolved inevitably real life many critics have supposed ibsen to commend nora conduct in the last act of the play he neither sanctions nor condemns but he does contrast her in the play with lind en and i not think that contrast can be too carefully 294 pg 295 pg the project

swinburne remarkably small success waited on their efforts still their numbers and their youth and while also their persistency seemed to promise new school of poesy with swinburne its head and great exemplar exemplar rather than head swinburne attitude amid all this devotion was rather that of the god than of the priest he sang and left the worshippers to work up their own enthusiasm and to this attitude he has been consta nt unstinting and occasionally unmeasured in praise and dispraise of other men he has allowed his own reputation the noble liberty to look after itself nothing instance could have been ﬁner than the careless almost disdainful dignity of his bearing in the months that followed tennyson death the cats were out upon the tiles then and his was the luminous expressive silence of sphere one felt whether he received it or here is the man who can wear the crown and her t endency towards abstractions it was not however the aloofness of swinburne bearing that checked the formation of swinburnian school of poetry the cause lay deeper and has come more and more into the light in the course of swinburne poetic say his thoroughly normal development we can see now that from the ﬁrst such school such successful following was an impossibility the fact is that swinburne has not only genius but an extremely rare and individual genius the germ of this individuality may be found easily enough in atalanta and the ballads but it luxuriates in his later poems and throughout and leaf and stem it was hardly more natural in 1870 to confess the magic of the great chorus before the beginning of years or of dolores than to embark upon the vain adventure of imitating them i can not imagine youth in all great britain so green or unknowing to attempt an imitation of nympholept perhaps the ﬁnest poem in the volume before i say in great britain because peculiar swinburne genius would be in any country it is doubly peculiar the endowment of an english poet if there be one quality beloved above others by the inhabitants of this island it is concreteness and i suppose there never was poet in the world who used less concreteness of speech than swinburne palgrave once noted that the landscape of keats falls short of the landscape of shelley in its comparative lack of the larger features of sky and earth keats was foreground work the most part but what shall be said of shelley universe after the immense vague regions inhabited by swinburne muse she sings of the sea but we never behold sail never harbor she sings of the stars we seem never to touch earth page

and all that night assembles of stars at dawn lie dead faint hope that smiles and trembles may tell not well dread but faith has heard it said very beautiful says the briton but why call this song

the particular and concrete to the general and abstract and in this direction swinburne muse has steadily marched in his erechtheus he tells how the gods gave pallas the lordship of the lordship and

and more deﬁnite poems are the edge of his blade and such volumes astrophel the heavy metal behind it the former penetrated the affections of his countrymen with ease the latter followed more

made desperate the windows of the room in which i sit face and consequently deal of sunshine comes in upon my table in cases out of the hundred this makes idleness in this the hundredth case it

daily one turns piece of this is not criticism of mr davidson plays his style full of imagination and wit now it would be easy and pleasant to express my great admiration of davidson muse and justify it by score of extracts and so make an end and nobody except perhaps davidson himself would know my dishonesty indeed and out of doubt he is in some respects the most of all our younger poets of wit and of imagination he has almost plethora they crowd this book and all his books from end to end and his frequent felicity of phrase is hardly less remarkable you may turn page after page and with

an unhistorical pastoral was ﬁrst printed so long ago 1877 and the last scaramouch in naxos pantomime in they are the work therefore of very young man who must use models while feeling his way to style and method of his own lack of architectonic quality is but and i am coming at length to my difﬁculty with davidson work oddly enough this difﬁculty may be referred to the circumstance that davidson poetry touches shakespeare great circle at second point wordsworth it will be remembered once said that shakespeare could not have written an epic wordsworth by the way was rather fond of pointing out the things that shakespeare could not have done shakespeare could not have written an epic he would have died of plethora of thought substitute wit thought and you have my difﬁculty with davidson it is given to few men to have great wit it is given to fewer to carry great wit lightly in davidson case it luxuriates over the page and seems persistently to choke his sense of form one image suggests another one phrase springs under thepg 317 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https shadow of another until the fabric of his poem is completely hidden beneath luxuriant ﬂowers of speech either they hide it from the author himself or conscious of his lack of architectonic skill he deliberately trails these creepers over his walls i think the former is the true explanation but am not sure let be cautious here or some remarks i made the other day upon another hosken author of phaon and sappho and verses by the be brought up against defending hosken against certain critics who had complained of the lack of dramatic power in his tragedies i said be it allowed that he has little dramat ic power and that since the poem professed to be tragedy dramatic power was what you reasonably looked but an alert critic considering the work of beginner will have an eye the well the main ones and if the author while missing the main prove effective with the hosken while failing to construct satisfactory drama gave evidence of strength in many ﬁne meditative at the worst he stands convicted of youthful error in choosing literary form unsuited to convey his thought not in the plays only these observations i believe to be just and having entered the caveat in hosken case i should observe it in davidso n also did these ﬁve youthful plays stand alone but davidson has published much since these plays ﬁrst s both in prose and fleet street eclogues ninian jamieson practical novelist random itinerary baptist lake and because i have followed his writings i think from his ﬁrst coming to london with the greatest interest i may possibly be excused speaking word of warning i am quite certain that davidson will never bore but i wish i could be half so certain that he will in time produce something in true perspective fabric duly proportioned each line of which from the beginning shall guide the reader to an end which the author has in view something which servetur ad imum qualis ab incepto pr ocesserit et sibi sibi constet be it remarked work of art may stand very far from nature provided its own parts are consistent heaven forbid that critic should decry an author being fantastic so long he is true to his fantasy but davidson wit is so brilliant within the circles of its temporary coruscation to leave the outline of his work in constant penumbra indeed when he wishes to unburden his mind of an idea he seems to have less capacity than many men of half his ability to determine the form best suited conveying it if anything can be certain which has not been tried it is that his story practical novelist should have been cast in dramatic form his vastly clever perfervid or the career of ninian jamieson is cast in two parts which neither unite to make whole nor are sufﬁciently independent to stand complete in themselves i ﬁnd it characteristic that his random itinerary fresh and agreeable narrative of suburban conclude with crashing poem magniﬁcent in itself but utterly out of key with the rest of the book turn to the compleat angler and note the exquisite congruity of the songs quoted by walton with the prose in which they are set and the difference will be apparent at once fate seems to dog davidson even into his illustrations random itinerary and this book of plays both published by mathews and lane have each conspicuous ly clever frontispiece but the illustrator of random itinerary has chosen his subject the very poem which i have mentioned out of harmony with the book and i must protest that the vilely sensual faces in beardsley frontispiece to these plays are hopelessly out of keeping with the sunny paganism of scaramouch in naxos there is nothing greek about beardsley ﬁgures their only relationship with the olympians is derived through the goddess aselgeia with all this i have to repeat that davidson is in some respects the most richly endowed of all the younger poets the grand manner comes more easily to him than topg 319 pg 320 pg 321 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https other and if he can cultivate sense of form and use this sense curb upon his wit he has all the qualities that take poet far 24 1984 ballads and songs at last there is mistake about it john davidson has come by his own and by his own i not

remember brown ﬁne verses on poets and poets he ﬁshes in the night of deep sea pools him the nets hang long and low and strong the silver schools come with the ebb and ﬂow of universal tides and all the channels glow or holding with his hand the weighted line he sounds the languor of the neaps or feels what current of the springing brine the cord diver gent sweeps the throb of what great heart bestirs the middle deeps thou also weavest meshes ﬁne and thin and all the forest ways but of that sea and the great heart therein thou knowest nought whole days thou and hast thy store of pies and jays davidson has never allowed us to doubt to which of these two classes he belongs him the nets hang long and low but though it may satisfy the pumblechook within us to recall our pleasant prophesyings we shall ﬁnd it more salutary to reme mber our fears we watched davidson struggling in the thicket of his own fancies and saw him too often break his shins over his own wit we asked will he in the end overcome the defect of his qualities will he remain unable to see the wood the trees or will he some day be giving us poems of which the whole conception and structure shall be beautiful

stanzas tennyson depicts confused and moving dream davidson wide earthly prospect the point to notice in each is the superlative skill with which the poet chooses the essential points of the picture and presents them so to convey their full meaning appealing at once to the senses and the intelligence tennyson who is handling mental condition in which the sensations are less sharply and logically separated than in waking vision can enforce this second appeal to the introducing the indeﬁnite divers woes between the deﬁnite sheets of water and the deﬁnite ranges of glimmering vaults with iron grates just wordsworth to convey the vague unanalyzed charm of singing combines the indeﬁnite old unhappy things with the deﬁnite battles long ago davidson on the other hand is describing what the eye sees and conveying what the mind suspects in their waking hours and is therefore restricted in his use of the abstract and indeﬁ nite notice therefore how he qualiﬁes that which can be sun the clouds

comprehend the divine and inexplicable gift of song the ballad of the making of poet but beautiful it is in detail this poem and at least one other in the little volume have the great merit which has hitherto been lacking in the best of davidson work they are thoroughly considered seen solid wholes seen not only in front but round at the back in fact they are natural growths of davidson philosophy of life in his ballad of the making of poet davidson lets us know his conception of the poet proper function i am man apart mouthpiece the creeds of all the world soulless life that angels may possess or demons haunt wherein the foulest things may loll at ease beside the loveliest martyr all mundane moods to tear the slave of every passion and the slave of heat and cold of darkness and of light trembling lyre every wind to sound within my heart i gather all the universe and sing sweetly the spheres and i shall be the ﬁrst of men to understand himself making of course full concessions to the demands of poetical treatment we may assume pretty conﬁdently that davidson intended this ballad in blank verse of the making of poet soul autobiography of kind if so i trust he will forgive doubting if he is at all likely to fulﬁl the poet ofﬁce he conceives it here or even to approach within measurable distance of his 326 pg 327 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir

ﬁxed purpose to be an æolian harp the winds of the world is of all men the least likely to be merely æolian the ﬁrst demand of æolian sound is that the instrument should have theories of its own and explicitly to proclaim yourself æolian is implicitly to proclaim yourself didactic matter of fact both the ballad of the making of poet and the ballad of nun contain sharply pointed morals very

björnson june 1 björnson first manner i see that the stories promised in heinemann new series of translations of björnson are synnövé solbakken arne happy boy the fisher maiden the bridal march magnhild and captain mansana the ﬁrst synnövé solbakken appeared in the others are dated thus arne in 1858 happy boy in 1860 the fisher maiden in 1868 the bridal march in 1873 magnhild in 1877 and captain mansana in there are some very signiﬁcant gaps here the most important being the eight years gap between happy boy and the fisher maiden again after 1879 björnson ceased to write novels while returning to the charge in 1884 with flags are flying in town and haven and following up with in god way translations of these two novels have also been published by heinemann the former under an altered title the heritage of the kurts and to use gosse words are the works by which björnson is best known to the present generation of englishmen they possess elements which have proved excessively attractive to certain sections of our public indeed in the case of in god way novel which was by means successful in its own country at its original publication has enjoyed an aftermath of popularity in scandinavia founded on reﬂected warmth from its english admirers taking then björnson ﬁction apart from his other writings with which i confess myself unacquainted we ﬁnd that it falls into three periods pretty sharply divided the earliest is the idyllic period pure and simple and includes synnövé arne and happy boy then with the fisher maiden we enter on stage of transition it is still the idyll but it grows elaborate confused by the realism that was coming into fashion all over europe and the trouble and confusion grow until we reach magnhild with flags are flying and in god way we reach third stage of realism some readers would say i should not agree but these tales certainly differ remarkably from their predecessors they are much longer to begin with in them too realism at length preponderates and they are probably near to pure realism björnson will ever get if asked to label these three periods i should call them the periods of 1 simplicity 2 confusion 3 dire confusion i speak of course foreigner oblig ed to read björnson in translations but perhaps the disability is not so important it seems at ﬁrst sight translations can not hide björnson genius nor obscure the truth that his genius is essentially idyllic now if one form of literary expression suffers more than another by translation it is the idyll its bloom is peculiarly delicate its freshness peculiarly quick to disappear under much handling of any kind but all the transla tions leave arne masterpiece and synnövé and the happy boy 331 pg 332 pg 333 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https many artists have been twisted from their natural bent by the long vogue of naturalism we shall never know we must make the best of the great works which have been produced under its inﬂuence and be content with that but we may say with some conﬁdence that björnson genius was unfortunate in the date of its maturity he was born on the 8th of december 1832 in lonely farmhouse among the mountains at the head of the long valley called osterdalen his father being priest of kvikne parish one of the most savage in all norway after six years the family removed to naesset in the romsdal spot enchanting and genial kvikne is the reverse gosse who prefaces heinemann new series with study of björnson writings quotes curious passage in which björnson records the impression of physical beauty made upon his childish mind by the physical beauty of naesset here in the parsonage of of the loveliest places in norway where the land lies broadly spreading where two fjords meet with the green braeside above it with waterfalls and farmhouses on the opposite shore with billowy meadows and cattle away towards the foot of the valley and far overhead along the line of the fjord mountains shooting promontory after promontory out into the lake big farmhouse at the extremity of each in the parsonage of naesset where i would stand at the close of the day and gaze at the sunlight playing over mountain and fjord until i wept though i had done something wrong and where i descending on my into some valley would pause though bewitched by loveliness by longing which i had not the power to explain but which was so great that above the highest ecstasy of joy i would feel the deepest apprehension and in the parsonage of naesset were awakened my earliest sensations the passage is obviously important and björnson shows how much impo rtance he attaches to the experience by introducing it or something like it time after time into his stories readers of in god latest of the novels under remember its opening chapter well it was good fortune indeed that boy of such gifts should pass his early boyhood in such surroundings nor did the luck end here while the young björnson accumulated these impressions the or idyll of country life was taking its place and growing into favor one of the most beautiful forms of modern immermann wrote der ober hof in weill and auerbach took up the running in 1841 and geor ge sand followed and fritz reuter björn son began to write in synnövé solbakken and arne came in on the high ﬂood of this movement these two stories writes gosse seem to to be almost perfect they have an enchanting lyrical quality without bitterness or passion which i look elsewhere in vain in the prose literature of the second half of the century to my mind without any doubt they and happy boy are the best work björnson has ever done in ﬁction or is ever likely to they are simple direct congruous all of one piece ﬂower is of piece with its root and never since has björnson written tale altogether of one piece his later manner here the luck ended all over europe there began to spread inﬂuences that may have been good some artists but were we may say peculiarly injurious to so naïf and at the same time so personal writer björnson i think another age will ﬁnd much the same cause to mourn over daudet when it compares his later novels with the promise of lettr es mon moulin and le petit chose naturalism demands nothing more severely than an impersonal treatment of its themes of three very personal and romantic writers our own stevenson escaped the pit into which both björnson and daudet stumbled you may say the temptation came later to him but the temptation to follow an european fashion does rule befall briton last of all men reasons of which we need not feel proud and the date of hardy stumbling is fairly recent after all björnson at any rate began very soon to be troubled between 1864 and 1874 from his 335 pg 336 pg 337 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https his year his invention seemed to some extent paralyzed the fisher maiden the one story written during that time starts beautifully arne but it grows complicated and introspective the psychological experiences of the heroine are not in the same key the opening chapters passing over nine years we ﬁnd magnhild much more vague and here he is visibly affected by french models and by the methods of the naturalists but he is trying to combine them with his own simpler traditions of rustic realism the author felt himself greatly moved by fermenting ideas and ambitions which he had not completely mastered there is kind of uncomfortable discrepancy between the scene and the style breath of paris and the boulevards blowing through the of puritanical norwegian village but the book is most interesting link between the early and the great novels of his latest period well of these same great novels flags are flying and in god must speak they think they seem to the laborious productions of man forcin g himself still further and further from his right and natural bent in them says gosse björnson returns in measure to the poetical elements of his youth he is now capable again instance in the episode of ragni symbolical walk in the woodlands in god way of passages of pure idealism yes he in measure he is capable of idyllic passages in other words his nature reasserts itself and he remains an imperfect convert he has striven hard to be realist and at times he has seemed to acquiesce altogether in the naturalistic formula but in truth he has never had anything essential in common with m zola in other words he has fallen between two stools he has tried to expel nature with pitchfork and still she runs back upon him he has put his hand to the plough and has looked back or if you take my view of the naturalistic formula he has sinned but has not sinned with his whole heart to produce homogeneous story either the acquired zola or the native björnson must have been cast out utterly value of early impressions to novelist i have quoted an example of the impr essions of björnson childhood i not think critics have ever quite realized the extent to which writers of those who use personal upon the remembered impressions of childhood such matter how are an author ﬁrsthand stock and in using them he comes much closer to nature than when he collects any number of scientiﬁcally approved data to maintain some view of life which he has derived from books compare flags are flying with arne and you will see my point the longer book is ten times realistic in treatment and about true to life george moore march 31 1894 esther waters it is good after all to come across novel written by man who can write novel we have been much in the company of the amateur of late and i one am very weary of of his preposterous and of his smart inept itudes of his solemn zeal in reforming

aspirations out of count i am weary of him and of his deceased wife sister and of their fell determination to discover each other soul in bottle of hay above all i am weary of his writings because he can not write neither has he the humility to sit down and 339 pg 340 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https geor ge moore on the other hand has steadily labored to make himself ﬁne artist and his training has led him through many strange places i should guess that among living novelists few have started with so scant an equipment far one can tell he had to begin with neither fertile invention nor subtle dramatic instinct nor an accurate ear language week ago i should have said this very conﬁdently after reading esther waters i say it less conﬁdently but believe it to be true nevertheless moore has written novels that are full of faults these faults have been exposed mercilessly moore has made many enemies but he has always possessed an artistic conscience and an immense courage he answered his critics briskly enough at the time but an onlooker of common sagacity could perceive that the really convincing answer was held in they say in america moore allowed he was going to write big novel one of these days and meanwhile we had better hold our judgment upon mr moore capacity open to revision what then is to be said of esther waters this volume of modest 377 pages upon which mr moore has been at work at least two years esther and mr hardy t ess well in the ﬁrst place i say without hesitation that esther waters is the most important novel published in england during these two years we have been suffering from the amateur during that period and doubt though it seems hard every nation has the amateur it deserves to ﬁnd book to compare with esther waters we must go back to december 1891 and to hardy tess of the it happens that certain similarity in the motives of these two stories makes comparison easy each starts with the seduction of young girl and each is mainly concerned with her subsequent adventures from the beginning the advantage of probability is with the younger novelist moore william latch is thoroughly natural ﬁgure and remains natural ﬁgure to the end of the book an uneducated man and full of failings but man always and therefore to be forgiven by the reader only little less readily than esther hersel f forgives him hardy alec is grotesque and violent lay ﬁgure wholly incredible cad hardy by killing tess child takes away the one means by which his heroine could have been led to return to without any loss of the reader sympathy moore allows esther child to live and thus has at hand the material one of the most beautiful stories of maternal love ever imagined by writer i dislike extravagance of speech and would run my pen through these words could i remember in any novel i have read more heroic story than this of esther waters poor work without money friends or charact er ﬁghting her child against the world and in the end dragging victory out of the struggle in spite of the æschylean gloom in which hardy wraps the story of tess i contend that esther ﬁght is from end to end the more heroic also esther story seems to informed with saner philosophy of life there is gloom in her story and many of the circumsta nces are sordid enough but throughout i see the recognition that man and woman can at least improve and dignify their lot in this world many people believe tess to be the ﬁnest of its author achievements devoted admirer of hardy genius i decline altogether to consent to my mind among recent developments of the english novel nothing is more lamentable than the manner in which this distinguished writer has allowed himself of late to fancy that the riddles of life are solved by pulling mouths at providence or whatever men choose to call the supreme power and depicting it savage and omnipotent bully directing human affairs after the fashion of practical joker fresh from village to this teaching his more recent writings plainly tend and alike in tess and life little ironies the part played by the president of the immortals is in the amount of force that of lout who pulls chair suddenly from under an old woman now by wedding necessity with uncouth jocularity hardy may have found an hypothesis that solves him all the difﬁculties of life i am not concerned in this place to deny that it may be the true explanation i have merely to point out that art and criticism must take some time in getting accustomed to it and that meanwhile the traditions of both are so farpg 342 pg 343 pg 344 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https in allowing certain amount of free will to direct the actions of men and women that tale which should be all necessity and free will would in effect be necessity own merely wanton freak in effect it comes to this story of tess in which attention is so urgently directed to the hand of destiny is not felt to be inevitable but freakish the story of esther waters in which poor is allowed to grapple with her destiny and after fashion to defeat it is felt or has been felt by one reader at any rate to be absolutely inevitable to reconcile us to the black ﬂag above wintoncester prison to the appointed end of tess career curse at least deep that of pelops should have been laid on the family tess curse does not lie by nature on all women nor on all dorset women nor on all dorset women who have illegitimate children very few even of these are hanged we feel that we are not concerned with type but with an individual case deliberately chosen by the author and amount of talk about the president of the immortals and his sport can persuade us to the contr ary with esther waters on the other hand we feel we are assisting in the combat of human life against its natural destiny we perceive that the woman has chance of winning we are happy when she wins and we are the better helping her with our sympathy in the struggle that is why using the word in the aristotelian sense i maintain that esther waters is more philosophical work than tess the atmosphere of the gambl ing in which moore characters breathe and live is doubt result of his careful study of zola it is everyone knows zola habit to take one of the many pursuits of war and religion down to haberdashery and veterinary expand it into an atmosphere novel but in moore case it may safely be urged that gambling on racehorses actually is the atmosphere in which million or two of londoners pass their lives their hopes their very chances of satisfying meal hang from day to day on the performances of horses they have never seen i can not profess to judge with what accuracy moore has reproduced the niceties of handicapping bookmaking and the rest the ﬂuctuations of the gambling market and their causes i gather that extraordinary care has been bestowed upon these details but criticism here must be left to experts i only know that not once or twice only in the course of his narrative moore makes us study the odds against horse almost eagerly if it carried our own money because it does indeed carry while the destiny of esther yet while only we feel that whichever horse wins the ultimate issues are inevitable it will be gathered from what i have said that moore has vastly outstripped his own public form even shown in mummer wife but it may be well to set down beyond possibility of misapprehension my belief that in esther waters we have the most artistic the most complete and the most inevitable work of ﬁction that has been written in england at least two years its plainness of speech may offend many it may not be favorite in the circulating libraries or on the bookstalls but i shall be surprised if it fails of the place i predict it in the esteem of those who know the true aims of ﬁction and respect the conscientious practice of that great art margaret woods 28 1891 esther

https paix the abbot and john inglesant in history louis xiv and napoleon are the most salient men of their time in ﬁction they fall back and give prominence to and the prince andré they may be admirably painted but unless they take subordinate place in the composition the artist scores failure disability of historical fiction the reason of this is of course very simple if an artist is to have full power over his characters to know their hearts to govern their emotions and sway them at his will they must be his own creatures and the life in them derived from him he must have an entirely free hand with them but the personages of history have an independent life of their own and with them his hand is tied thackeray has freehold on the soul of beatrix esmond but he takes the soul of marlborough furnished on short lease and has to render an account to the muse of history he is lord of one and mere occupier of the other nor will it to say that an artist by sympathetic and intelligent study can master the motives of any group of historical characters sufﬁciently his purpose since they have anticipated him and lived their lives without his help they leave him but choice between two poor courses if he narrate their lives and adventures they really befel he is writing history if on the other hand he disregard historical accuracy he might just well have used another set of characters or have given his charac ters other names indeed it would be much better if alcibiades went matter of fact to sparta and matter of ﬁction you make him stay at home you merely advertise to the world that there was something in alcibiades you understand and if you are writing about an alcibiades whom you quite understand you will save your readers some risk of confusion by calling him charicles now jonathan swift and esther johnson and esther vanhomrigh really lived and by living became historical but woods sets forth to translate them back into ﬁction not subordinate characters but protagonists she has chosen to work within the difﬁcult limits i have indicated but there are others which might easily have cramped her hand even more closely tale of passion to be told in t erms of reason the story of swift and esther vanhomrigh is story of passion and runs on the conﬁnes of madness but it happened in the age of reason doubtless men and women felt madness and passion in that age doubtless too they spoke of madness and passion but not in their literature and now that the lips are dust and the ﬁery conversations lost woods has only their written prose to turn to help to satisfy the pedant she must tell her story of passion in terms of reason in one respect thackeray had more difﬁcult task in esmond he aimed to make his book reﬂection in every page and line of the days of queen anne not only had he like woods to make his characters and their talk consistent with that age but every word of the story is supposed to be told by gentleman of that age whereas woods in her narrative prose may use the language of her own century on the other hand the story of esmond deals with comparatively temperate emotions there is nothing in thackeray masterpiece to strain the prose of the age of reason it is pitched in the key of those times and the prose of those times is sufﬁcient and exactly sufﬁcient it that it should be so is all the more to thackeray honor the artist is to be praised in the conception duly in the execution of his work but the conception being granted i think esther vanhomrigh must have been harder book than esmond to write even the prose of swift himself is inadequate to swift he was great and glaring anomaly who never fell into perspectiv with his age while he lived and can hardly be pulled into perspective now with the drawing materials which are left to us men of like abundant genius are rarely measurable in language used by their contemporaries and this is perhaps the reason why they disquiet their contemporaries so confoundedly where in the books written by gentlemen or in the letters written by swift himself can you ﬁnd words to explain that turbulent and potent man he bursts the capacity ofpg 350 pg 351 pg 352 pg the

he splits them down the back it is in meeting this difﬁculty that woods seems to to display the courage and intelligence of true artist she is bound to be praised by many her erudition but perhaps she will let thank her having trodden upon her erudition in the ﬁrst volume it threatened to overload and sink her but sooner does she begin to catch the wind of her subject than she tosses all this superﬂuous cargo overboard from the point where passion creeps into the story this learning is carried lightly and seems to be worn unconsciously instead of cataloguing the age she comprehends it to the warmth and pathos she packs into her conversation without modernizing it thereby is something amazing this alone the book would be notable and it can be proved to come of divination simply because nothing exists from which she could have copied it more obvious though not more wonderful is her feminine gift of rendering scene vivid us by describing it not it is but it excites her own intelligence or feelings let explain myself it is the sorry fate of book so interesting and suggestive esther vanhomrigh to divert the critic from praise of the writer to consider dozen problems which the writer raises women and le don pittoresque well then jules lemaître has said with considerable women when they write have not le don pittor esque by this he means that they not strive to depict scene exactly it strikes upon their senses but they perceive it after testing its effect upon their emotions and experience suppose now we have to describe moonlit night in may woods begins man might begin the few and twinkling lights disappeared from the roadside cottages the full white moon was high in the cloudless deep of heaven and the sounds of the warm summer night were all about their path the splash of leaping ﬁsh the sleepy chirrup of birds disturbed by some creature the song of the the persisten t churring of the night jar and the occasional hoot of the owl far of f on some ancestral tree now all this except perhaps the ancestral tree is direct picture and with it some men might stop but woman could stop here and woods does not she goes on it was such an exquisite may night full of the mystery and beauty of moonlight and the scent of hawthorn makes the earth an eden in which none but lovers should lovers or young poets whose large eyes so blind in the daylight world of men can see god walking in the garden you see it is sensation longer but reﬂection and emotion now i am only saying that women can not avoid this i am not condemning it on the contrary it is beautiful in woods hand and sometimes luminously true take this instance of the interior of city church it had none of the dim impressiveness of mediæval church that seems reared with view to heaven rather than earth and whose arches massive or soaring neither gain nor lose by the accidental presence of ephemeral human creatures below them the building seemed to cry out congregation and the mind eye involuntarily peopled it with its sunday complement of substantial citizens and their families this is not picturesque but reﬂective description yet how it illuminates if we had never thought of it before we know now once and all the essential difference between gothic church and one of wren building and further since woods ispg 354 pg 355 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https of an age that slighted gothic the architecture of wren and his follo wers we get brilliant to help our comprehension it is hint only but it assures us we read that we are in the eighteenth century when men and women were of more account than soaring aspirations and the conclusion is that if woods could not conquer the difﬁculties which beset any attempt to make protagonists of two historical characters if she was obliged to follow the facts to the detriment of composition she has vitalized and recreated dead age in fashion to make us all wonder esther vanhomrigh is great feat and its authoress is one of the few of whom almost anything may be expected 26 1895 the v agabonds in her latest book woods returns to that class of far life may be she handled so memorably in village tragedy there are differences though the titles indicate the life in the earlier story was stationary in the latter it is characters are artistes in travelling show this at once suggests comparison with edmond goncourt les frères zemganno or rather contrast the two stories conceived in very similar surroundings differ in at least two vital respects compared with les frères zemganno what in short is the story of les frères zemganno two brothers gianni and nello tumblers in show that travels round the village fairs and small country towns of france are seized with an ambition to excel in their calling they make their way to england where they spend some years clowning in various circuses then they return to make their debut in paris gianni has invented at length trick act feat that will make the brothers famous they are performing it the ﬁrst time in public when circus girl who has spite against nello causes him to fall and break both his legs he can perform more and henceforward he watches his brother performing strange jealousy awakes and grows in him causing him agony whenever gianni touches trapèze gianni discovers this and renounces his art now here in the ﬁrst place it is to be noted that the whole story depends upon the circus profession and the brothers love it and desire to excel in it the catastrophe nello jealousy gianni are inseparable from the atmosphere of the book the catastrophe is professional catastrophe the jealousy professional jealo usy the sacriﬁce sacriﬁce of profession and in the second place we know even if we had not his own word it that to his etherealized the atmosphere of the and idealized the surroundings he calls his tale an essay in poetic realism je suis trouvé dans une ces heures la vie vieillissantes maladives lâches devant le travail poignant et angoisseux mes autres livres en un état où la vérité trop vraie antipathique moi aussi fait cette fois dans du rêve mêlé du souvenir we know from the goncourt journals exactly what is meant by du souvenir we know that edmond goncourt is but translating into the language of the and symbolizi ng in the story of gianni and nello the story of his own literary collaboration with his brother jules collaboration of quite singular intim acy that ceased only with jules death in possibly zola once suggested edmond goncourt did at ﬁrst intend to depict the after his wont in true naturalistic manner softening and extenuating nothing but par une délicatesse qui il reculé devant le milieu brutal cirques devant certaines laideurs et certaines monstruosités des personnages the two facts remain that in les frères zemganno goncourt 1 made professional life in circus the very blood and tissue of his story and 2 that he softened the details of that life and to certain degree idealized 357 pg 358 pg 359 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https to woods book and taking these two points in reverse order we ﬁnd to begin with that she idealizes nothing and softens next to nothing where she does soften she softens only literary give word its due force or picture its proper values she does not instance accurately report the oaths and blasphemies the tents and booths of the show were disappearing rapidly like stage scenery the manager joe and several others in authority ran hither and thither shouting their orders to crowd of workmen in jackets and fustian trousers who were piling rolls of canvas and heavy chests and mountains of planks and long vibrating poles on the great waggons others were harnessing the big powerful horses to the carts horses that were mostly white and wore large red collars the scene was so busy so full of movement that it would have been exhilarating had not the fresh morning air been full of senseless blasphemies and other deformities of speech uttered casually and constantly without any apparent consciousness on the part of the speakers that they were using strong language probably the lady who dropped toads and vipers from her lips whenever she opened them came in process of time to consider them the usual accompaniments of conversation there are great many reasons against copious profanity of speech here you have the artistic reason and by implication that which forbids its use in its ineffectiveness but though she selects woods does not reﬁne she exhibits the life of the travelling show in its habitual squalor well in its occasional brightn ess how she has managed it passes my understanding but her book leaves the impression of conﬁdent familiarity with this kind of life of knowledge not merely accumulated but assimilated knowing we that woods was not brought up in circus we infer that she must have spent much labor in research but taken by itself her book permits such inference the truth is that in the case of genuine artist line can be drawn between knowledge and imagination woods has to remarkable degree that gift which henry james describes the faculty which when you give it an inch takes an ell and which an artist is much greater source of strength than any accident of residence or of place in the social scale the power to guess the unseen from the seen to trace the implication of things to judge the whole piece by the pattern the condition of feeling life in general so completely that you are well on your way to knowing particula r corner of it be this it may woods has written novel which mastery of an unfamiliar milieu is almost ﬁt to stand beside esther waters i say almost although woods mastery is easier and less conscious than moore it neither goes so deep to the springs of action nor bears so intimately on the conduct of the story but of this later if one thing more than another convinces that woods has thoroughly realized these queer characters of hers it is that she makes them so much like other people whatever our profession may be we are generally silent upon the instincts that led us to adopt indeed we happen to be writers and make living out of so these strollers are silent upon the attractiveness of their calling but they crave openly any of us distinction and they worship respectability heartily and outspokenly any of the whose amusement they tumble and pull faces it is small merit in this book that it reveals how much and yet how very little divides the performers in the ring from the audience in the sixpenny seats i wish i had space to quote particularly ﬁne will ﬁnd it on pp which woods describes the progress of these motley characters through midland lanes on fresh spring morning the shambling white horses with their red collars the painted vans the cages where bears paced uneasily and strange birds thrust uncouth heads out into the sunshine the two elephants and the camel padding through the dust and brushing the dew off english hedges the hermetically sealed omnibus in which the artistes bumped and dozed while the thompson held forth undeterred on those advantages of birth and furniture which made her discomforts of real importance whatever those of the other ladies in the show might be pg 361 pg 362 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https in bringing her vagabonds into relation with ordinary english life woods loses all or nearly all of that esoteric professional interest which at ﬁrst sight would seem the chief reason choosing circus people to write about the story of les frères zemganno has i have said this esoteric profess ional interest the story of the vagabonds is the story of husband and of young wife who does not love him but discovers that she loves another story old the hills and common to every rank and every calling woods has made the husband clown the wife girl with strict notions about respectability and the lover fritz handsome young german gymnast but there was fundamenta l reason this choice of professions the tale might be every bit true of grocer and grocer wife and grocer assistant once or twice indeed in the earlier chapters we have promise of more peculiar story when we read of morris objection to seeing her husband play the clown woman she says that had been brought up to the business would like to see her husband look like that and of joe morris we read that he took an artistic pride in his clowning but there follows serious struggle betwee n love and such struggle instance zola has worked out to tragic issues in his morris shame at her husband ridiculous appearance merely heightens the contrast in her eyes between him and the handsome young gymnast but though the is not essential woods makes most effective use of it i will select one notable illustration of this when morris at length makes her is in the wagon and at unhappy husband

entered he could hear the noise of the chain which had been fastened to the elephant legs being suddenly dragged he spoke to chang and the noise ceased then running up short ladder which was close to

manxman hall caine new novel the manxman london william heinemann is big piece of work altogether but on ﬁnishing the tale i turned back to the beginning and read the ﬁrst 125 pages over again and then came to stop i wish that portion of the book could be dealt with separately it can not it but sets the problem in human passion and conduct which the remaining 300 pages have to solve nevertheless the temptat ion is too much one who thought he knew how good hall caine can be at his best i must confess to shock of delight or rather growing sense of delighted amazement while reading those 125 pages yet the story is very simple story of two friends and woman the two friends are philip christian and pete quilliam philip talented accomplished ambitious of good family and eager to win back the social position which his father had lost by an imprudent marriage pete nameless bastard son of philip uncle and gawky brave and incurably generous the boys have grown up together and in love are almost more than brothers when the time comes them to part ilip leaving home school while pete goes to one cæsar cregeen who combined the occupations of miller and landlord of the manx fairy and now enters the happy child when ﬁrst we make her the shape of katherine cregeen the daughter of pete employer with her poor simple pete falls over head and ears in love philip too when home his holidays is drawn by the same dark eyes but stands aside his friend naturally the miller will not hear of pete landless moneyless nameless lad suitor his daughter and so pete sails kimberley to make his fortune conﬁding kitty to philip care it seems that the task undertaken by of watching over his friend sweetheart familiar one in the isle of man and he who dischar ges it is known by familiar name they call him the dooiney molla the and his primary function is that of an informal unmercenary purely friendly and philanthropic introduced by the young man to persuade the parents of the young woman that he is splendid fellow with substantial possessions or magniﬁcent prospects and entirely ﬁt to marry her but he has secondary function less frequent though scarcely less familiar and it is that of lover by proxy or intended husband by deputy with duties of pg 368 pg 369 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https guardianship over the girl while the man himself is off the herrings or away the mackerel or abroad on wider voyages and now of course begins philip christian ordeal kitty discovers that she loves him and not pete and he that he loves kitty madly on the other hand there is the imperative duty to keep faith with his absent friend and more than this his future is full of high hope the eyes of his countrym en and of the governor himself are beginning to fasten on him the most promising youth in the island it is even likely that he will be made deemster and so win back all the position that his father threw away but to marry if he can bring himself to break faith with be to marry beneath him to repeat his father disaster and estrange the favor of all the high society of the island therefore even when the ﬁrst line of resistance is broken down by report that pete is dead philip determines to cut himself free from the temptation but the girl who feels that he is slipping away from her now takes fate into her own hands it is the day of melliah her father farm philip has come to put an end to her hopes and she knows it the melliah is cut and the usual frolic begins then the young fellows went racing over the ﬁeld vaulting the stooks stretching straw rope the girls to jump over heightening and tightening it to trip them up and slackening it and twirling it to make them skip and the girls were falling with laugh and leaping up again and ﬂying off like the dust tearing their frocks and dropping their if the grains they had been reaping had got into their blood in the midst of this maddening frolic while cæsar and the others were kneeling by the kate snatched philip hat from his head and shot like gleam into the depths of the glen philip dragged up his coat by one of its arms and ﬂed after her here then in sulby glen the girl stake s her last last throw of every wom an wins it is the truly celtic wooes the man and secures her love and in the end her shame when good woman falls from honour is it merely that she is the victim of momentary intoxication of stress of passion of the fever of instinct it is mainly that she is the slave of the sweetest tenderest most spiritual and pathetic of all human fallacy that by giving herself to the man she loves she attache s him to herself ever this is the real betrayer of nearly all good women that are betrayed it lies at the root of tens of thousands of the cases that make up the merciless story of man sin and woman weakness alas it is only the woman who clings the closer the impulse of the man is to draw apart he must conquer it or she is lost such is the old cruel difference and inequality of man and woman nature made old trick the old tragedy and meanwhile pete is not dead but recovered and coming home here on 125 ends the second

humor and set it to shine on his page the secret i suppose is their common possession manxmen and like all the best art theirs is true to its country and its material pete comes home suspecting harm still childish of heart and loud of triﬂe too loud by the way his shouts begin to irritate the reader and the reader begins to feel how sorely they must have irritated his wife the unhappy kate is forced after all into marrying pete and so the tragedy begins i wish with my heart i could congratulate hall caine warmly upon the remainder of the book upon its ﬁrst two parts he is too sure an artist to miss the only adequate the problem the puriﬁcation of philip christian and kitty must come if at all by ﬁre and hall caine is not afraid to take us through the deepest ﬁre suffering daunts the anguish of kitty writhing against her marriage with pete nor the desperate pathos of pete after his wife has run away pretending to the neighbors that she has only gone to liverpool her health and actually writing letters and addressing parcels to himself and posting them from towns to deceive the local postman nor the moral ruination of philip with whom kitty is living in hiding nor his ﬁnal redemption by the ordeal of public confession before the great company assembled to see him reach the height of worldly ambition and be appointed governor of his native island and have suspicion that hall caine who deals by preference with the elemental emotions would rejoice in the epithet æschylean applied to his work the epithet would not be unwarranted but it is precisely when most consciously æschylean that hall caine in my poor judgment comes to grief this is but to say that he possesses the defects of his qualities there is altogether too much of the go to let be titanic about the book æschylus has grown triﬂe too well aware of his reputation has taken to underscoring his points and tends to prolixity in consequence hall caine has not little of hugo audacity but with it not little of hugo diffuseness standing like destiny with scour ge lifted over the naked backs of his two poor sinners he spares them single so much little one every detail that can possibly heighten their suffering is brought out in its place until we feel that life after all is more careless and tell ourselves that fate does not measure out her revenge with an inch rule we see the machinery of pathos at work and we are rather made incredulous than moved when the mach inery works so accurately that philip is made to betray pete on the very night when pete goes out to beat big drum in philip honor nor is this by any means the only harrowing coincidence of the kind worse than its effect upon us work of emotions are so ﬂogged and by detail after detail that they can not rise at the last big fence and so the scene of philip confession in the courthouse misses half its effect it is ﬁne scene i am bigoted admirer of very cold one should be the last to say that the famous scene in the scarlet letter can not be improved upon nor i make any doubt that originally conceived by hall caine the story had its duly effective climax here but still less i doubt that the climax and therefore the whole story would have been twice impressive had the book from 125 onwards contained just half its present number of words but whether this opinion be right or wrong the book remains big book and its story

that i suggest only combination of the of the two stories hope has written them these move on levels altogether different the constant reader of the speaker causeries will be familiar with the two in

such that being produced in either direction and to any extent they never meet the distance between the parallels does not count or rather it is just matter the author to choose it is here that howells makes his mistake who speaks contemptuously of romance puss in boots puss in boots is masterpiece in its way and in its way just true to to its distance from that very different masterpiece silas lapham when howells objects to the ﬁgure of vautrin in le père goriot he criticizes well vautrin in that tale is out of drawing and therefore monstrous but to bring similar objection against porthos in le vicomte bragelonne would be very bad criticism it would ignore all the postulates of the story in real life vautrin and porthos would be equally monstrous in the stories vautrin is monstrous and porthos is not but though the distance from real life at which an author conducts his tale is just matter his own choice it usually happens to him after while either from taste or habit to choose particular distance and stick to it or near it henceforth in all his writings thus scott has his own distance and jane austen hers balzac hugo charlotte brontë dickens tolstoi howells these have their favorite distances and all are different and can not be confused but young writer usually starts in some uncertainty on this point he has to ﬁnd his range and will quite likely lead off with miss or ricochet hardy led off with desperate remedies before ﬁnding the target with under the greenwood tree now application of these profound remarks is coming at young writer hovers in choice

is practice at short range it moves very close to real life real people of course not converse briskly and wittily hope characters but these have nothing of the impossible in them and even in the whole business of omofaga there is nothing more fantastic than its delightful name the book is genuinely tragic but the tragedy lies rather in what the reade r is left to imagine than in what actually occurs upon the stage that it never comes to more explicit and vulgar issue stands not so much to the credit of the heroine i suppose we must call dennison to the force of circumstances manipulated in the tactful grasp of hope nor is it to be imputed to him fault that the critical chapter xvii reminds us in half dozen oddly indire ct ways of certain chapter in richar d fever el the place the situation the reader suspense are similar but the actors their emotions pg 378 pg 379 pg 380 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https purposes are vastly different it is ﬁne chapter and the page with which it opens is the worst in the solitary purple patch of ﬁne writing i observe without surprise that the admiring attention is seldom caught but by something out of been fastening upon it and quoting it ecstatically the indiscr etion of the duchess is the tale in hope second manner of the prisoner of zenda story story it falls triﬂe sort of the prisoner of zenda f the telling is ﬁrmer surer more accomplished in each an aimless superﬁcially cynical but naturally amiable english gentleman ﬁnds himself casually involved in circumstances which appeal ﬁrst to his sportsmanlike love of adventure and so by degrees to his chivalry his sense of honor and his passions at ﬁrst amused then perplexed then nettled then involved heart and soul he is left to ﬁght his way through with the native weapons of his tact honesty wit strength of sacriﬁce aptitude affairs the donnée of these tales their spirit their postulates are nakedly romantic in them the author deliberately lends enchantment to his view by withdrawing to convenient distance from real life but once more the enchantment is everything and the distance nothing if i must ﬁnd fault with the later of the stories it will not be with its general or extravagance is part of the secret of romance with the sordid and very nasty madame delhasse she would be repulsive enough in any case but marie mother she is peculiarly repulsive and let add improbable nobody looks heredity in tale of this sort but even in the fairy tales it is always the heroine who ends very ﬁtly with roll downhill in barrel full of spikes but great are the differences between the god in the car and the indiscr etion of the duchess i ought to say that the former carries it ought more weight of they have their points of similarity both illustrate conspicuously hope gift of advancing the action of his story by the sprightly conversation of his characters there is touch of dumas in their talk and more than touch of sterne of the sentimental journey i beg your pardon madame said i with whirl of my hat i beg your pardon sir said the lady with an inclination of her head one is so careless in entering rooms hurriedly i observed oh but it is stupid to stand just by the door insisted the lady to sum up these are two most entertaining books by one of the writers whose next book one searches eagerly in the

write too much his own health trilby 14 hypnotic fiction number of i am can not abide hypnotism in ﬁction in my own case the dislike has been merely instinctive and i have never yet found time to examine the instinct and discover whether or not it is just and reasonable the appearance of edition of trilby the most successful tale that has ever dealt with the success of the dramatic version of trilby presented few days ago by tree invite one to apply the test clearly there are large numbers of people who enjoy hypnotic ﬁction or whose prejudices have been effectively subdued by du maurier tact and talent must we then confess that our instinct has been unjust andpg 382 pg 383 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https and give it up we must like trilby and there is help shall we enjoy the tale under protest and in spite of its hypnotism analysis of an aversion i think my ﬁrst objection to these hypno tic tales is the terror they inspire i am not talking of ordinary human terror which of course is the basis of much of the best tragedy we are terriﬁed by the story of macbeth but it is with rational and salutary terror we are aware all the while that the moral laws are at work we see hideous calamity looming approaching imminent but we can see that it is the effect of causes which have been duly exhibited to us we can reason it out we know where we stand our conscience approves the punishment even while our pity calls out against it and when the blow falls it shakes away none of our belief in the advantages of virtuous conduct it leaves the good old impregnable position be virtuous and you will be happy stronger than ever but the terror of these hypnotic stories resembles that of child in dark room artistic reasons too obvious to need pointing out the hypnotizer in these stories is always the villain of the piece the same or similar reasons the subject is always person worthy of our sympathy and is usually woman let us suppose it to be good and beautiful that is the comm onest case the gives us to understand that by hypnotism this good and beautiful woman is while completely in the power of man who is ex hypothesi beast and who ex hypothesi can make her commit any excesses that his beastliness may suggest obviously we are removed outside the moral order altogether and in its place we are presented with state of things in which innocence honesty love and the rest are entirely at the disposal and under the rule of malevolent brutality the result presented to us being qualiﬁed only by such tact the author may choose to display that du maurier has displayed great tact is extremely creditable to du maurier and might have been predicted of him but it does not alter the fact that form of ﬁction which leaves us at the mercy of an author tact is very dangerous form in world which contains so few du mauriers it is lamentable enough to have to we must over so much of human ah what avails the sceptred race and what the form divine but it must be quite intolerable when story leaves us demanding what avail native innocence truthfulness chastity when all these can be changed into guile and uncleanliness at the mere suggestion of dirty mesmerist the answer to this i suppose will be but hypnotism is scientiﬁc fact people can be hypnotized and are hypnotized are you one of those who would exclude the novelist from this and that ﬁeld of human experience and then i am quite prepared to hear the old tag homo sum once more misapplied limitation of hypnotic fiction let us distinguish hypnotism is proved fact people are hypnotized hypnotis m is not delimited fact nobody yet knows precisely its conditions or its effects or if the discovery has been made it has certainly not yet found its way to the novelists them it is yet chieﬂy ﬁeld of fancy they invent vagaries it they invent ghosts and the humananum nihil alienum defence my strongest objection to hypnotic ﬁction is its inhumanity an experience is not human in the proper artistic sense with which alone we are concerned merely because it has befallen man or woman there was an irishman the other day who through mere inadvertence cut off his own head with scythe but the story is rather inhuman than not still less right have we to call everything human which can be suppos ed by the most liberal stretch of the imagination to have happened to man or woman story is only human in so far it is governed by the laws which are recognized determining human action now according we regard human action its two great determinants will be free will or necessity but hypnotism entirely does away with free will and necessity fatal or circumstantial itpg 385 pg 386 pg 387 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https the lawless and irresponsible imperative of casual individual man who in ﬁction usually happens to be scoundrel story may be human even though it discard one or more of the recognized conditions of human life thus in the confessedly supernatural story of jekyll and hyde the conﬂict between the two jekylls is human enough and morally signiﬁcant because it answers to conﬂict which is waged day by rule less the soul of every human being but the double trilby signiﬁes nothing she is naturally in love with little billee she is also in love with svengali but quite unnaturally and irresponsibly there is real conﬂict gecko says of he had but to say and she suddenly became an unconscious trilby of marble who could produce wond erful the sounds he wanted and nothing think his thoughts and wish his love him at his bidding with strange unreal factitious love just his own love himself turned inside reﬂected back on him from mirror un écho un simulacre quoi pas autre chose it was not worth having i was not even jealous this last passage i think suggests that du maurier would have produced much less charming story indeed but vastly more artistic one had he directed his readers attention rather upon the tragedy of svengali than upon the tragedy of trilby svengali position complete master of woman will and yet unable to call forth more than factitious just his own love himself turned inside out and reﬂected back on him from mirror really tragic one and ﬁne variation on the old frankenstein motif the tragedy of frankenstein resides in frankenstein himself not in his creature an incongruous story in short trilby peter ibbetson fall into two parts the natural and supernatural which will not join they might possibly join if du maurier had not made the natural so exceedingly domes tic had he been less successful with the trilby and little billee and taffy and the laird all of whom he has taught us so extravagant liking but his very success with these domestic if oddly domestic ﬁgures and with the very domestic tale of little billee affair of the heart proves our greatest when we are invited to follow the machinations of the superlative svengali that the story of svengali and of trilby voice is good story only duffer would deny so is gautier la morte amour euse perhaps the best story of its kind ever written but suppose thackeray had taken la morte amour euse and tried to write it into pendennis st ockt on 21 stevenson t estimony in his chapter of personal memories printed in the century magazine of july last gosse speaks of the peculiar esteem in which frank stockton stories were held by robert louis stevenson when i was going to america to lecture he was particularly anxious that i should lay at the feet of frank stockton his homage couch ed in the following lines my stockton if i failed to like it were sheer depravity i went down with the hyke and up with the gravity 389 pg 390 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https adored these tales of mr stockton taste which must be shared by all good men it is shared at any rate by some thousands of people on this side of the atlantic only one is not quite sure how far their admiration extends far can be i have never come across any british attempt at serious appreciation of general disposition is to regard him an amusing kind of cuss with queer kink in his fancy who writes puzzling little stories that make you smile taking him seriously why he does even profess to write seriously absurd objection of course but good enough the reviewer who sits up all night in order that the public may have his earliest possible opinion on the reminiscences of bishop or the personal recollections of b or tour taken in ireland by the honorable criticism just now mere matter of business convenience provides relative importance books before they appear and in this classiﬁcation the space allotted to ﬁction and labelled important is crowded the moment with works dealing with religious or sexual difﬁculties everyone has read rudder grange the lady or the tiger and borrowed month but somehow few people seem to think of them subjects serious criticism classical qualities and yet these stories are almost classics that is to say they have the classical qualities and only need time to ripen them into classics nothing but age divides story of the quality of the lady or the tiger instance from story of the quality of rip van winkle they are full of wit but the wit never chokes the style which is simple and pellucid their fanciful postulates being granted they are absolutely rational and they are in high degree original originality good temper good sense moderation these are classical qualities and he is rare benefactor who employs them all the amusement of the world comparison at ﬁrst sight it may seem absurd to compare stockton with defoe you can scarcely imagine two men with more dissimilar notions of the value of gracefulness and humor or with more diver gent aims in writing stockton is nothing if not fanciful and defoe is hardly fanciful at all nevertheless in reading one i am constantly reminded of the other you must remember stockton habit is to conﬁne his eccentricities of fancy to the postulates of tale he starts with some wildly rule not conjuncture of circumstances this being granted however he deduces his story logically and precisely appealing never to our passions and almost constantly to our common sense his people are full of defoe they may have more pluck than the average man or woman and they usually have more adaptability but they apply to extraordinary circumstances the good unsentimental reasoning of ordinary life and usually with the happiest results the shipwreck of lecks and aleshine was extraordinary enough but their subsequent conduct was rational almost to preci sion and in rationality does fancy what economy of emotional utterances does emotion we may apply to stockton tales remark which saintsbury let fall some years ago upon he was speaking particularly of flaubert tentation saint antoine the capacities of dreams and hallucinations literary treatment are undoubted but most writers including even quincey who have tried this style have erred inasmuch they have endeavoured to throw portion of the mystery with which the waking mind invests dreams over the dream itself anyone experience is sufﬁcient to show that this is wrong the events of dreams they happen are quite plain and matter and it is only in the intervals and so to speak the of dreaming that any suspicion of strangeness occurs to the dreamer dream however wild is quite plain and matter to the dreamer therefore verisimilitude the narrative of dream should be quite plain and matter in thepg 392 pg 393 pg 394 pg the project gutenberg ebook of adventures in criticism by sir arthur thomas https way the narrator of an extremely fanciful tale verisimilitu is the ﬁrst aim of to exclude all suspicion of the unnatural from his reader mind and this is only done by persuading him that suspicion of the unnatural occurred to the actors in the story and this again is best managed by making his characters persons of sound common sense if these are not upset by what befalls them why the unconscious why in the world should i be upset so in spite of the enormous difference between the two writers there has been one since defoe who so carefully stockton regulates the actions of his characters by strict common sense nor i at the moment remember any writer who comes closer to defoe in mathematical care detail in the case of the englishman this carefulness was sometimes when he makes colonel jack remember with exactness the lists of articles he stole boy and their value in the adventur es of captain horn the machinery which conceals and guards the peruvian treasure is so elaborately described that one is tempted to believe stockton must have constructed working model of it with his own hands before he sat down to write the book in way this accuracy of detail is part of the character of the narrative and undoubtedly helps the verisimilitude enormously genuine american but to my mind stockton characters are even more original than the machinery of his stories and in their originality they reﬂect not only stockton himself but the race from which they and their author spring in fact they seem to about the most genuinely american things in american ﬁction after all when one comes to think of it lecks and captain horn merely illustrate that ready adaptation of pluck and businesslike common sense to savage and unusual circumstances which has been the real secret of the colonization of the north american continent captain horn discovery and winning of the treasure may differ accidentally but not differ in essence from thousand true tales of commercial triumph in the great central plain or on the paciﬁc slope and in the heroin of the book we recognize those very qualities and aptitudes which we have all learnt to admire and esteem the american girl they are hero and heroine and so of course we are presented with the better side of national character but then it has been the better side which has done the business the bitterest critic of things american will not deny that stockton characters are typical americans and could not belong to any other nation in the world nor can he deny that they combine sobriety with pluck and businesslike behavior with good feeling that they are full of honor of resource and sportsmanlike sagacious that people with such characteristics should be recognizable by us typical americans is sufﬁcient answer to half the nonsense which is being talked just now propos of recent silly contest

in the world to proﬁt by the criticisms of his books he has never proﬁted in the least by any of them now leonard has at least this much in common with archdeacon farrar that before him criticism must sit down with folded hands in the lightness of his heart he accepts every fresh argument against such and such course an added reason following it while this collection of poems was being made he tells us known author and critic took occasion to gently ridicule sic anthologies and anthologists he suggested if the force of foolishness could further go that the next anthology would deal with dogs undismayed by this to use his own words leonard proceeded to prove it now it is obvious that man can set term to literary activity if it depend on the briton notorious unwillingness to recognize that he is beaten i might dare instance scotsman to compile an anthology on the eel in british poetry but of what avail is it to challenge an indomitable race i am sorry leonard has not given the name of this critic but have notion it must be andrew lang though i am sure he is innocent of the split inﬁnitive quoted above it really ought to be lang if only the humor of the means by which leonard
