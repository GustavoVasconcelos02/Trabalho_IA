variation of emma and sometimes spelt emmot sens is corruption of sancha natur alised among us in the thirteenth century and collet or colette the dimin utive of nichola common and favourite name in the middle ages chapter two christabel alice benden had reached cranbrook and was busied with her various errands her position was slightly superior to that of emmet and collet she was the wife of man who lived upright which enigmatical expression signified that he had not to work his living edward benden s father had made little money and his son who had children to whom to leave his propert y chose to spend all well by emily sarah holt https than bequeath it to distant relativ es who were strangers to him he owned some houses at staplehurst one of which was occupied by the pardues and he lived on the rents of these and the money saved by his thrifty father the rents he asked were not unreasonable but if tenant failed to pay out he must go he might well appeal to the door to edw ard benden this agreeable gentleman treated his wife much he did his tenants he gave sum of money into her hands certain purchases and with that sum those purchases must be made it was not of the least use to explain failure by an unexpected rise in prices or the fact that the article required could not be had at given time mr benden expected every one but himself excuses many and often very poor were admitted that favoured individual but other had chance to offer an on the present occasion alice had ten shillings her marketing with which she was expected to provide six rabbits dozen pigeons twent eggs five yards of buckr am black satin cap and brown silk doublet her husband pair of shoes herself and sundry things at the spicer s the grocer or grosser the word was originally spelt only sold wholesale and his stock we have it was divided among the spicer pepperer and that her money would not stretch thus far alice well knew and she knew also that if she were to avoid scolding mr benden s personal wants must be supplied whatev er became of her own her first call therefore was at the capper s the satin cap which cost one shilling and eightpence then at the tailor s the doublet which took four and sixpence then she paid ninepence the pigeons which were mr benden s personal eating and next she went to the spicer s sugarloaf she must have expensiv it was her tyrant required his dishes sweet and demanded that the result should be effected by dainty sugar not like common people by honey or treacle nor did she dare to omit the currants since he liked currant cake with his cheese and ale two pounds of prunes and four of rice she meant to add but those were not especially him and must be left out if needful when she had reached this point alice paused and counted up what money she had left doublet 4 shillings 6 pence cap 1 shilling 8 pence pigeons 9 pence sugarloaf 7 pence currants 1 shilling total 8 shillings 6 pence thus ran alice s calculations only eighteenpence left the other things i wanted will come to 6 shillings 9 pence what can i without the buckr am must go that was the heaviest article in the list five yards at ninepence yard alice s sunda y gown must be worn without new lining while longer two rabbits instead of six at twopence piece three pennyworth of eggs at eight penny these she could scarcely without the shoes too were badly wanted rice and prunes could not be had alice bought pair of cheaper shoes than she intended paying tenpence instead of shilling purchased the two rabbits and the eggs and found that she had one penny left she decided that this would answer her y it must so mr benden was not likely to ask if she had all she neede d so long she did not fail to supply his own requirements she arranged with the poulterer to put by the rabbits pigeons and eggs which she would send boy in the afternoon and carrying the rest of her parcels with which she w well laden she took the road to staplehurst she turned the corner of the last house in cranbrook she was brought to b y voice behind her alice all well by emily sarah holt https light sprang to alice s eyes she turned quickly round to greet man few years older than herself man with grave dark eyes and brown beard passing all her parcels into the left hand she gave him the action which at that time was an indication of intimate friendship the kiss and the have changed places since then why roger i look not to see thee now how goes it this morrow with christie the lord will good sister and that mefeareth is but evil nay i will not lay that name on aught the lord doth but she suffers sorely poor darling wilt come round our w ay and look in on her alice i would i might roger said alice with rather distressed look but this morrow thou hast not good conveniency thereto roger finished the sentence her then let be till thine occasion serveth only when it so doth bethink thee that look on unt alice is r are comfort to the little maid be thou sure i shall not forget it tom came in last night roger he and tabitha and the childre said he fare well that s good hearing and edw ard hath his health oh y edw ard doth r arely well mr benden was not apt to lose his health which partly accounted the very slight sympath y he was wont to show with those who were it was noticeable that while other people were spoken of by affectionate diminutiv es both from alice and her brother edw ard and t abitha receiv ed their names in full well then alice i shall look when thou shalt be able to come the lord have thee in his k eeping the lord be with thee dear r oger and roger hall turned down side street while alice went on toward staplehurst they were deeply attached to each other this brother and sister and all the more they found little sympath y outside their mutual affection roger was quite aware of alice s home troubles and she of his they could see but little of each other while mr benden had not absolutely forbidden his brother w to enter his house it was familiar fact to all parties that his sufficiently sharp temper was not softened by visit from roger hall and alice s sufferings from the temper in question were gener ally enough to prevent her from trying it further it was not only sharp but also uncertain what pleased him few things did please was by means sure to please him alice trod on perpetual volcano which was given to opening and engulfing her just at the moment when she least expected it roger s home troubles were of another sort his wife was dead and his one darling was his little christabel whose few years had hitherto been passed in pain and suffering the apothecary was not able to find out what hidden disorder sapped the spring of little christie s health and made her from her very babyhood frail weak pallid invalid scarcely fit to anything except lie on sofa learn all well by emily sarah holt https little lessons from her father and amuse herself with fancy work playfellow she could seldom bear her cousins the three daughters of her uncle thomas who lived about mile away were too rough and noisy the frail child with one justine who was lame and could not keep up with the rest but justine was not comfortable companion she possessed grumbling temper or it would perhaps be more correct to say she was possessed by it she suffered far less than christie yet christ ie was always bright and sunny while justine was dark and cloudy yet not ev en justine tried christie did her unt tabitha aunt tabitha was one of those women who wish and mean to great deal of good and can not tell how to it not that she realised that inabilit y by any means she was absolutely convinced that nearly all the good done in the weald of kent was done by tabitha hall while the real truth was that if tabitha hall had been suddenly transported to botan y bay or any other distant region the weald of kent would have got along quite well without her according to aunt tabitha the one grand duty of every human creature was to rouse himself and other people and measured by this rule aunt tabitha certainly did her duty she earnestly impressed on alice that mr benden would develop into perfect angel if only she stood up to him and she was never tired of assuring christie that her weakness and suffering were entirely the result of her own idle disinclination to rouse herself thus urged christie did sometimes try to rouse herself the result being that when depriv ed of the stimulating presence of aunt tabitha she was fit nothing but bed some time afterw ards it was good thing her that aunt tabitha s family kept her busy at home the most part so that her persecutions of poor christie were less frequent than they would otherwise have been mr thomas hall the younger brother of roger and alice had the air of man who had been stood up to until he had lost all power or desire of standing up himself he remark ed that it was fine morning with an aspect of deprecation that would have made it seem quite cruel to disagree with him even if it were raining hard he never contradicted his tabitha poor man he knew too well what would come of it it would have been easy him to walk up to the mouth of loaded cannon when the gunner was applying the match to remark to her in howev er mild tone that he preferred his mutton boiled when he knew she liked it roasted yet he was good man in his meek unobtrusiv way and christie liked her uncle thomas next best to her father and unt alice christie i marvel you are not weary said her lively robust cousin friswith corruption of fridea wide one not weary ah how little friswith knew about it i am b y times friswith said christie meekly mother saith she is assured you might have better health an you would you lie and lie there like log of wood

closed the door on christabel and ran off lightly down the cr anbrook road chapter three the comfortable justice mr justice roberts sat in his after supper with tankard of ale at his elbow had the pernicious weed been discovered at that date he would probably also have had pipe in his hand but tobacco being yet calamit y of the future the justice w not smoking he was howev er very comfortable he sat in big leather chair which rested his portly figure he had just had good supper consisting of partridge pie and dish of juicy pears he had sold horse that morning at consider able profit his mind w easy his body there was only one thing the occurrence of which mr roberts would have thought it worth his while to deprecate at that moment this was anybody coming to bother him the worth y justice did not like to be bothered good many people are of the same opinion he had that evening but one enem y in the world and that w the man who should next r ap at his house door go to jericho said the justice to the unseen individual who was thus about to disturb his rest i want none of you why on earth can t you let man alone what is it martha please y master tis master benden would ha ve word with y what can the companion want mildly growled the justice well let him in and bring another tankard good ev ening master benden fine autumn ev trow all well by emily sarah holt https benden s face said that he had come to talk about something of more moment than autumn evenings he sat down opposite the justice buttoned his long gown up to the neck if to gird himself action and cleared his throat with an air of importance master r oberts i am come on gr ave matter and sad can t deal with grave matters after supper said the justice come again in the morning t ake pear sir this is serious business business hours are ver i nev er business out of hours master r oberts and only shall serv this business i business out of hours solemnly repeated the officer of the law take two pears and come again in the morning mr benden shook his head in tr agic manner and let the pears alone they are good pears said the justice if you love pears put one in your pocket with my commendations to good mistress benden how doth she well i hope were i able sir replied the visitor impressiv ely to bear your commendations to good mistress benden i were the happier man but alas i am not at that pass what come you hither to complain of your wife fie master benden go you home and peace her like wise man you are and cast her half suffering some woman s gear mr benden might most truthfully have made reply that he had ere that evening bestowed on his wife not half suffering only but many whole ones but he knew that the justice meant half sovereign which was then pronounced exactly like suffering sir he said rather angrily it pleases you to reckon lightly of this matter but what i pray you if you have to make account thereon with the queen s grace s laws not to speak of holy church sir i give you to wit that my wife is an ill hussy and an heretic belike and lacketh sharp pulling than i can give her she will not go to church neither hear mass nor hath she shriven her this many day you are set in office methinks to administer the laws and have right thus to shuffle off your duty by hours and minutes i summon you to perform it in this case mr justice roberts was grave enough now the tone which he had hitherto worn was cast aside entirely and the expression of his face grew almost stern but the sternness was not all the culprit thus arraigned before him much of it was the prosecutor he was both shock ed and disgusted with the course mr benden had tak en which course is not fiction but fact master benden said he i am two queen s officer of her laws and plain anthon y roberts of cranbrook you speak this even but to anthon y roberts and such good master i would have you bethink you that if your wife be brought afore justice i must deal with her according to law you know moreo ver that in case she shall admit her guilt and refuse to amend there is all well by emily sarah holt https open to save to commit her to prison and you know i suppose what the end of that may be consider well if you are avised to go through with it man need count the cost of building an house ere he la yeth in load of bricks you are not wont master justice to be thus tender over women said benden derisiv ely methinks ere now i have heard you to thank the saints you never wedded one and may so yet again master benden i covet little to have wife to look like many men in his day mr roberts looked upon wife not somebody who would look after him in the sense of making him comfortable but rather one whom he would have the trouble of perpetually keeping out of all sorts of ways that were naught y and wrong but that is not your case he continued in the same stern tone you set you resolv to persev ere ball rolling that may not tarry till it reach the fire are y avised thereon i am y our dut y was the sa vage reply then you yours said mr roberts coldly and bring mrs benden before next sessions there is time to forethink y ere it come unconscious of the storm thus lowering over her alice benden

educated people were there more books than about dozen an invalid confined to bed or sofa whether child or adult there was little resource save needlework alice had come to bring her little niece roll of canvas and some bright d silks having so much time to spare and so little variety of occupation christie was more skilful embroideress than many older women new pattern was great pleasure and there were few pleasures open to the invalid and lonely child her sole home compan y was her father their one servant nell was too busy with the whole work of the house upon her hands to more christabel than necessit y required and mr hall who was manager of one of the large factories in cranbrook was obliged to be away nearly the whole day other compan aunt alice was rather trial than pleasure to christabel the young people were rough and noisy even when they tried not to be so and the child s nerves were weak aunt tabitha worried her to rouse herself and not be burden on her poor father and how gladly would christabel have done it uncle thomas was also harassing visitor though in another way he never knew what to say when he had once asked how the invalid felt he only sat and gazed at her and the window alternately now and then though b y mental jerk bringing out few words he causes to feel so naught y aunt said christie dolefully and i want to be good he sits and looks on till i i aunt alice i can t find the words if all my brains would come out of my finger if he went on and now and then he says word or rain afore night likely or bought drove of pigs yesterda y and i can only

prepared combat mr benden apparently did not see her till he was nearly close to her when he at once spurred forward to get away pursued by the vindictiv tabitha whose shrill voice was audible she ran though the words could not be heard they were not howev er difficult to imagine of course the horse soon distanced the woman aunt tabitha with shake of her head and another of her clenched fist at the retreating culprit turned back her basket which she had set down on the bank to be rid of its weight in the pursuit mr benden s reflections were not so pleasant they might have been and they were pleasanter having receiv ed curt and cold welcome that morning from several of his acquaintances in cranbrook people manifestly disappro ved of his recent action there were many who sympathised but little with alice benden s opinions and would even have been gratified by the detection and punishment of heretic who were notwithstanding disgusted and annoyed that quiet gentle and gener ally respected gentlew oman should be denounced to the authorities by her own husband he of all men should have shielded and screened her even justice roberts had nearly much told him so mr benden felt himself martyr the world was hard on disinterested virtue and had sympath y with it is true the world did not know his sufferings at the hands of mary who could not send up decent and who was privately of opinion that an improper hash or hash at all was quite good enough the man who had accused her dear mistress to the authorities mr benden was growing tired of disinterested virtue which w its own rew ard and v ery poor all well by emily sarah holt https i can t stand this much longer i must have alice back was his reflection he alighted from the ba y horse but nemesis had intention of letting him off thus easily mistress tabitha hall had carried home her geese and and after roasting and eating the former with chestnut sauce churning the week s supply of butter setting the bread to rise and indicating to friswith and joan her elder daughters what would be likely to happen to them if the article were either over or under baked she changed her gown from working woollen to an afternoon camlet and took her way to briton s mead mr benden had supped best he might on very tough chicken pie with crust not much softer than crock ery and neither his digestion nor his temper was in happy condition when mary rapped at the door and much to her own satisfaction informed her master that mistress hall would fain have speech of him mr benden groaned almost audibly could he by an act of will have transported tabitha to the further side of the mountains of the moon nobody in staplehurst would have seen much more of her that year but alas he had to run the gauntlet of her comments on himself and his proceedings which he well knew would not be complimentary full hour they were closeted together mary in the kitchen could faintly hear their voices and rejoiced to gather from the sound that to use her own expression the master was supping his broth right well peppered at last mistress tabitha marched forth casting parthian dart behind her see you edward benden without you want another basin hot water and i ll set the k ettle on to boil this time i promise y good even mary she added she came through the kitchen he without any antecedent has promised he ll all he can to fetch her forth and if he doesn t and metely soon too he ll wish he had that s all so saying mistress tabitha marched home to inspect her bread and if need were to set the k ettle on there also note is the highest note in the musical system of guido d aretino which was popular in the sixteenth century strain beyond therefore signified something impossible or unreasonable chapter seven wherein alice comes home partly moved by faint sense of remorse partly by mrs tabitha s sharp speeches and partly most of y his private discomfort in respect of mary s culinary unskilfulness mr benden set himself to eat his dose of humble pie he waited on mr horden of finchcocks and mr colepeper of bedgebury park two of the chief men of position and influence in his neighbourhood to entreat them to exert themselv es in persuading the bishop to release alice soon possible the diocese of course was that of cardinal pole but this portion of it was at that time in the hands of his suffragan dr richard thornton bishop of dover whom the irreverent populace familiarly termed dick of dover this right reverend gentleman was not of the quiet and reasonable type of mr justice roberts on the contrary he had keen scent heretic and took great delight in bringing one into tribulation on receiving the letters wherein messrs horden and all well by emily sarah holt https alice benden his lordship ordered the prisoner to be brought before him the archbishop s gaoler went down to the prison where alice benden gentlewoman by birth and education shared one large room with women of the worst character and lowest type some committed slight offences some heavy crimes these women were able to recognise in an instant that this prisoner was of different order from themselv es those who were not fallen into the depths treated her with some respect but the lowest either held aloof from her or jeered at the latter alice took all meekly did what she could the one or two that were ailing and the three or four who had babies with them spoke words of gospel truth and kindly sympath y to such would let her speak them and when sleep closed the eyes and quieted the tongues of most meditated and communed with god the gaoler opened the door little way and just put his head into the women s room the prisoners might have been thankful that there were separ ate chambers men and women such luxuries were unknown in man y gaols at that date alice benden he said gruffly alice rose gave back to its mother baby she had been holding and went towards the gaoler who stood at the top of the stone steps which led down from the door here i am master gaoler what would y with tie on y our hood and follow y are to come afore m y lord of alice s heart beat somewhat faster she took down her hood from one of the pegs around the room and followed the gaoler through long passage up flight of steps across courtyard and into the hall where the bishop was holding his court she said nothing which the gaoler could hear but the god in whom alice trusted heard an earnest cry lord i am thine save thine handmaid that trusteth in thee the gaoler led her forward to the end of long table which stood before the bishop and announced her name to his lordship alice benden of briton s mead staplehurst an it lik your lordship ah said his lordship in an amiable tone she it is touching whom i had letters come hither to i pray you mistress will you now go home and go to church in time coming that meant would she consent to worship images and to reverence to the bread of the lord s supper if

nothing but priest who stood by whether mistak enly thinking that she spoke or kind enough to wish to help her answered her she sa ys she will m y lord enough go thy ways said the bishop who seemed to wish to set her at liberty perhaps he was little afraid of the influential men who had interceded her alice thus dismissed walked out of the hall free woman she came out into palace street hand w laid upon her shoulder well alice said edward benden s voice i wrought hard to fetch you forth i trust y be rightly thankful come home not word did he say of the pains he had taken originally to drive her into the prison neither did alice allude to that item she only said in the meek est manner i thank you edward and followed her lord and master down mercery lane towards wincheap gate she did not even ask whether he had made any prepar ations her journey home or whether he expected her to follow him on foot through the y miles which lay betwee n canterbury and staplehurst but when they reached the western corner of the lane mr benden stopped at the old chequers inn and in stentorian voice demanded that the old bay horse which alice knew so well and which her husband had not succeeded in selling more than its worth he desired was brought forth laden with saddle and pillion on the latter of which alice took her place behind mr benden not word was spoken by either during the journey they were about mile from staplehurst and had just turned corner in the road when they were greeted by words in consider able number glad to see you said brown the face inside it was not visible i reckoned you

emily sarah holt https eight repenting his repentance it was saturda y evening and three days after alice returned home mr benden sat in the chimney having just despatched much more satisfactory supper than mary had ever allowed him to see during her mistress s imprisonment and alice her household duties finished the day came and sat in the opposite corner with her work the chimney at that date was literally chimney there were grates and the fire of logs blazed on wide square hearth around which and inside the chimney was stone seat comfortably cushioned and of course extremely warm this was the usual evening seat of the family especially its elder and more honour able member how they contriv ed to stand the very close quarters to the blazing logs and how they managed never to set themselv es on fire must be left to the imagination alice s work this evening was knitting stockings certainly not the idea of knitted stockings had not yet dawned stockings were still they had been centuries cut out of woollen cloth and sewn together like any other garment the woman who was to immortalise her name by the brilliant invention of knitting stockings was then little girl just learning to use her needles what alice was knitting this evening was soft woollen cap intended the comfort of mr benden s head the inside of the head in question was by means so comfortable alice was preparing to make the outside mr benden was pulled two ways and not knowing which to go he kept trying each in turn and retracing his steps he wanted to make alice behave herself by which he meant conform to the established religion queen mary had romanised it and go silently to church without making insubordinate objections to idolatry or unpleasant remarks afterw ards this was only to be attained it seemed to him by sending her to prison but also he wanted to keep her out of prison and to ensure the continuance of those savoury suppers on which his comfort and contentment depended and the existence of which appeared to depend on her remaining at home how were the two to be harmoniously combined reflections of this kind resulted in making mr benden very uncomfortable man and he was man with whom to be uncomfortable was to be unreasonable alice he said at last after period of silent thought alice looked up from her work the morrow shall be sunda alice assented to that indisputable fact you ll come to church with one instant alice was silent her husband thought she was wavering in her decision but on that point he was entirely mistak en she was doing what nehemiah did when he prayed to the god of heaven between the king s question and his answer well she knew that to reply in the negativ might lead to reproach prison torture even death yet that was the path of god s commandments and flowery meadow must tempt her to stray from it in her heart she said to him who had redeemed her all well by emily sarah holt https saviour where er th y steps i see dauntless

not have him and you plotting to win you away ere the catchpoll constable come to carry you hence you ll tarry here without you make up your mind to be conformable and go to church the idea of escape from the toils drawing close around her had never entered alice s brain till then now one moment it surged in wild excitement through her mind the next moment it w gone v oice seemed to whisper to her the cup which th y father hath giv en thee wilt thou not drink it then she said tranquilly be it you will because i can not rightly obey you in one matter i will be the more careful in all other to order y desire mr benden answered only by sneer he did not believ in meekness in his estimation women who pretended to be meek and submissiv were only trying to beguile man in his heart he knew that this gentle obedience was not natur al to alice who had high spirit and plenty of fortitude and instead of attributing it to the grace of god which was its real source he set it down to desire to cheat him in some unrev ealed fashion he went to church and alice stayed at home she was bidden finding that she had done so mr benden tried hard to discover that one of her brothers had been to see

looked in his face to see if he meant it then he shook his head dipped his hand into his purse and pulled out which he passed to mr benden who pocketed this price of blood alice had walked on down the market place and was out of hearing mr benden strode after her with the in his pock et chapter nine alice decides herself not that road mistress alice had nearly reached the end of the market place when her husband s harsh call arrested her she had been walking slowly on so that he might overtake her on hearing this she paused and w aited him to come up that s not the way to canterbury said mr benden seizing her by the wrist and turning her round i thought we were going home said alice quietly methinks mistress there s somewhat wrong with your hearing this morrow heard y not the justice commit y to gaol truly i so did edward but i heard also the constable to say that he would come when it should stand with his conveniency and i reckoned it was thus settled then you reckoned without your host the constable hath given money to carry y thither without y and that will i with v ery good will given you money through six years of unhapp y married life alice benden had experienced enough of her husband s constant caprice and frequent brutalit y but this new development of it astonished her she had not supposed that he would descend so far to take the price of innocent blood the tone of her voice not indignant but simply astonished increased mr benden s anger the more gently she spoke the harsher his voice grew this is not unusual when man is engaged in wilfully doing what he knows to be wrong verily your hearing must be evil this morrow mistress he said with some wicked words to emphasise his remark the constable hath paid royal farthing and here it is his pocket he and i have yet to earn it come step out we ha ve time to lose all well by emily sarah holt https came to sudden edward she said firmly you shall not carry to gaol i will have care of your character though you little regard mine i pray you unhand and i will go mine own self to the constable and entreat him to take his office and duty this part of the story howev er extr aordinary is pure fact in sheer amaz ement mr benden s hand unloosed from alice s arm and seizing her opportunit y she walked rapidly back to the court house moment he stood considering what to he had little more concern his own reputation than hers but he felt that if he followed her to the constable he could scarcely avoid refunding that thing he by means desired to this reflection decided him he went quickly to the inn where he had left his horse mounted and rode home leaving alice to her own devices to walk home or get taken to canterbury in an y way she could the constable was not less astonished than mr benden he was not accustomed to receiv visits from people begging to be taken to gaol he scratched his head put it on one side and looked at alice if she were curiosit y in an exhibition then took off his cap again and scr atched his head on the other side well to be sure he said at last to tell truth my mistress i know not what to with you i can not mine own self win this day to canterbury and i have place to tarry y here nor ha ve i an y to send withal sa ve yon lad he pointed he spoke to his son lad of about twelv years old who sat on the bench by the court house door idly whistling and throwing up pebble to catch it again then i pray you master constable said alice eagerly send the lad with i am loth to put you to this labour but verily i am forced to it and methinks you may lightly guess i shall not run way from custody the constable laughed but look ed undecided in very deed said he i see not wherefore you should not go home and tarry there till such time i come to fetch you but if it must be it must i will go saddle mine horse and he shall carry y to canterbury with george while the constable went to saddle the horse and alice sat on the bench waiting till it was ready she fought with very strong temptation her husband would not receiv her so much she knew certaint y but there were others who would how welcome roger would have made her and what perfect haven of rest it would be to live even few days with him and christabel her old father too at frittenden who had told her not many days before with tears in his eyes how bitterly he repented ever giving her to edward benden it must be remembered that in those days girls were never permitted to choose themselv es whether they wished to marry man or not the parents always decided that point and sometimes in this instance they came to sadly mistak en decision alice had not chosen her husband and he had never given her any reason to love him but she had done her best to be good wife and even now she would not depart from it the temptation was sore and she almost gave way under it but the constant habit of referring everything to god stood her in good stead in this emergency to go and stay with her brother whose visits to her mr benden had forbidden would be sure to create scandal and to bring his name into even worse repute than it was at present she must either be at briton s mead or in canterbury gaol all well by emily sarah holt https now the gaol was the only possible place her be it so god would go with her into the more certainly than into roger s home and the place where she could be sure of having god with her was the place where alice chose and wished to be her heart sank heavily she heard the great door of the gaol clang to behind her alice was made of materials more than flesh and blood she could enjoy rest and pleasantness quite well other people and she wondered drearily she went down the steps into the women s room how long she was to stay in that unrestful and unpleasant place why are you come again said one of the prisoners alice descended the steps what y wouldn t conform w ell more would i alice recognised the face of decent woman who had come in the same day that

confess himself in the wrong he was not going to humble himself he said gruffly there was nobody to hear to that spiteful cat tabitha to alice he was at once very angry with her and very much put out by her absence it was all her fault he said again why could she not behave herself at first and come to church like reasonable woman and everybody else did if she had stood out new dress or velvet hood he could have understood it but these nonsensical fancies nobody could understand who could by any possibilit y expect sensible man to give in to such rubbish so mr benden reasoned himself into the belief that he was an martyr alice most unreasonable woman and tabitha wicked fury having all well by emily sarah holt https that any one else should have them was both unneces sary and absurd in his eyes he simply could not imagine the possibilit y of woman caring so much the precepts or the glory of god that she was ready their sakes to brave imprisonment torture or death mean while alice and her fellow rachel potkin were engaged in trying their scheme of living on next to nothing we must not forget that even poor people at that time lived much better than now so far eating is concerned the spanish noblemen who came over with queen mary s husband were greatly astonished to find the english peasants they said living in hovels and faring like princes the poorest then never contented themselv es with plain fare such we think tea and bread which are now nearly all that many poor people see from one year s end to another meat eggs butter and much else were too cheap to mak it necessary so alice and rachel arranged their provisions thus every two days they sent two pounds of mutton which cost some days farthing and some halfpenn y twelv little loaves of bread at 2 pence pint and half of claret or quart of ale cost 2 pence more the halfpenn y which was at times to spare they spent on four eggs few rashers of bacon or roll of butter the price of which was y the gallon sometimes it went salt an expensiv article at that time now and then they varied their diet from mutton to beef but of this they could get only half the quantit y their halfpenn on then rigidly observ ed of course they bought fish instead of meat fortnight they kept up this practice which to them seemed far more of hardship than it would to us they were accustomed to number of elabor ate dishes with rich sauces in most of which wine was used and mere bread and meat or even bread and butter seemed very poor rough eating perhaps if our ancestors had been content with simpler cookery their children in the present day would have had less trouble with doctors bills roger hall visited his sister he had said on saint edmund s day the sixteenth of november he found her calm and even cheerful very much pleased with her father s message and gift and concerned that mary should follow her directions to make mr benden comfortable that she forgave him she never said in words but all her actions said it strongly roger had to curb his own feelings he promised to take the message to this effect which alice sent to mary but alice could pretty well see through his face into his heart and into mary s too and she looked up with smile she added few words tell mall she said that if she love and would have yet again at home methinks this were her wisest plan roger nodded and said more chapter eleven tabitha s basket of all the persons concerned in our story at this juncture the least unhapp y was alice benden in canterbury gaol and the most miser able was edward benden at briton s mead his repentance was longer this time in coming but his suffering and restlessness certainly were not so he tried all sorts of ways to dispel them in vain first he attempted to lose himself in his library he was the rich possessor all well by emily sarah holt https volumes eight of which were romances of chivalry wherein valiant knights did all kinds of impossibilities at the behest of fair damsels rescued enchanted princesses slew giants or wandered months over land and sea in quest of the holy grail which few of them were sufficiently good even to see and none to bring back to arthur s court but mr benden found that the adventures of sir isumbr or the woes of the lady blanc hefleur were quite incapable of making him forget the very disagreeable present then he tried rebuilding and newly furnishing part of his house but that proved even less potent to divert his thoughts than the books next he went into compan y laughed and joked with people played games sang and amused himself in sundry ways and came home at night to feel more solitary and miser able than before then in desper ation he sent the barber to bleed him our forefathers had curious idea that unless they were bled once or twice year especially in spring they would never keep in good health we perhaps owe some of our frequent poverty of blood to that fancy the only result of this process was to make mr benden feel languid and weak which was not likely to impro ve his spirits lastly he went to church and was confessed his sins and was absolv ed by the priest he certainly ought to have been happy after that but somehow the happiness would not come he did not know what to next all these performances had taken some time christmas came and christmas with its morning mass and evening carols its nightly waits its mummers or mask ed itiner ant actors its music and dancing its games and sports its and there were none of these things alice benden in her prison save to which she treated herself and rachel and

what s her name aunt an it like you didn t but i would like to pray her said christie with disappointed look and i can t say bless that woman why not said aunt tabitha bluntly art feared the lord

of woman s hood the number of her pearls and the breadth of her lace and fur were carefully regulated by sumptuary laws and woe betide the esquire s daughter or the knight s wife who presumed to poach

holland and mistress p andor roberts to visit the little mistress if anything could have cowed or awed tabitha hall it would certainly have been that vision of mistress grena in her dress of dark blue velvet edged with black fur and her tawny velvet hood with its pearl border she recognised instinctiv ely the presence of woman whose individualit y was almost equal to her own with the education and bearing of gentlewoman added to it christabel was astonished at the respectful way in which aunt tabitha rose and courtesied to the visitors told them who she was and that the master of the house was away at his daily duties ay said mistress grena gently we wot that master hall must needs leave his little maid much alone my brother master roberts of primr ose croft is owner of the works whereof he is manager this announcement brought yet lower courtesy from tabitha who now realised that members of the family of r oger hall s master had come to visit christabel and young folks love well to converse together apart from their elders and my niece s discretion may well be trusted added mistress grena if it serve you mistress hall we will tak our lea ve which road go y i will attend y m y mistress an y road if that stand with y our pleasure in good sooth i would gladly speak with you little i have an errand to cranbrook and if it answer with your conveniency then shall you mount my niece s horse and ride with thither i returning hither her when mine occasion serv tabitha having intimated that she could make this arrangement very well suit her convenience she wished to go to cranbrook some day that week the elder women took their departure and p andor was left alone with christie some girls would have been very shy of one another in these circumstances but these two were not thus troubled pandor because she was too well accustomed to societ y and christie because she was too much excited by the unwonted circumstances pandor drew christie out by few short questions and many minutes had not passed before she knew much of the child s lonely life and often sorrowful fancies father s the best father that ever was or ever could be said christie lovingly but look you mistress he is bound to leave can t tarry with and i ve sisters and mother and aunt tabitha can t be here often and aunt alice is at present thou art somewhat like little christie though i have one sister i also have mother you miss her mistress asked christie struck by the pathos of pandor s tone oh so much the girl s eyes filled with tears i can t remember my mother said christie simply she was good everybody says but i can t recollect her whit i was only baby when she went to heaven to live with the lord jesus all well by emily sarah holt https ah but i remember mine was pandor s answer my sister was thirteen and i was eleven when our mother died and i fretted so much her they were feared i might go into waste and i was sent away five years to dwell with my grandmother all the length of england off i have but now come home so thou seest i can feel sorry lonesome folks little christie christie s face flushed slightly and an eager wistful look came into her eyes she was nerving herself to make confession that she had never made before even to her father or her aunt alice she did not pause to ask herself why she should choose pandor its recipient she only felt it possible to say it to the one and too hard to utter it to the others it isn t only lonesomeness and that isn t the worst either but everybody says that folks that love god ought to work him and i can t any work it doth him good that i should work in coloured silks and wools and the like and i can t nothing else so i can t work god i would i could something i wouldn t care how hard it was s one of my because she says her work is so hard but if i could work i wouldn t grumble howev er hard it w only it were work god little christie said pandor softly stroking the fair hair shall i tell thee secret if it please you mistress the answer did not come with any eagerness christie thought the confession which had cost her something was to be shelved matter of interest and her disappointment showed itself in her face pandor smiled when i was about thy years christie one day i came downstairs i made false step and slid down to the bottom of the flight it was not very an steps or more but i fell with my ankle doubled under and nigh fortnight i could not walk the pain i had to lie all day on and though divers young folks were in the house and many sports going i could not share in any but lay there and fretted er my misfortune i was not patient i was very impatient but there was in the house good man friend of my grandmother that came one even into the parlou r where i lay and found in tears he asked questions he did but lay his hand upon my brow i lay there with my kerchief to mine eyes and quoth he my child to the work of god is to his will hast thou y et learned m y lesson christie christie s eyes were eager enough now she saw that the answer was coming not put aside something more entertaining to p andor many and many time christie hath that come back to when i have been called to that which was unpleasing to that which perchance seemed lesser work god than the thing which i was doing and i have oft found that what i would have done instead thereof was not the work god set but the work i set then can i work god if i only lie here if god bid thee lie there and bear pain and weakness and weariness dear child then that is his work because it is his will thee it would not be work god if thou wert to arise and scour the floor when he bade thee bide still and suffer ah christie we are all of us sore apt to make that blunder think that the work we set ourselv es is the work god setteth us and tis very oft he giveth us all well by emily sarah holt https the eager active soul is set to lie and bear while the timid ving nature is bidden to arise and but so long it is his will it is his work it did not strike christie anything peculiar or surpris ing that her new acquaintance should at once begin to talk to her in this strain she had lived exclusiv ely with people older than herself and all whom she knew intimately were christian people aunt tabitha sometimes puzzled her but christie s nature was not one to fret and strain over point which she could not comprehend it seemed to her therefore not only right but quite matter of course that p andor roberts should be of the same t ype her father and her unt alice i thank you mistress she said earnestly i will mine utmost to bear it in mind and then ma ybe i shall not be so impatient oft i am art thou impatient christabel oh dreadfully said christie drawing long sigh not always look you there be times i am content or if not i can keep it all inside mostly but there be times it will not tarry within but comes right out and then i m so shamed of myself afterw ard i marvel how it is that peevishness isn t like water and other when they come pouring out they are out and they are done but the more peevishness comes out of you the more there seems to be left in tis not oft look you it really comes right outside that would be shocking but tis deal too often and i want to be lik the lord jesus something bright and wet dropped on christabel s forehead pandor stooped to kiss her little christie she said tenderly i too right earnestly desire to be like the lord jesus but the best of all is that the lord himself desires it us he will help us both and we will pr ay each other chapter fourteen unexpected tidings when roger hall came home that evening he was greeted by christie with an amount of excited enthusiasm which he did not often hear from his little invalid daughter oh f ather father i ha ve new friend and such good pleasant maid she is christie did not term her new friend nice she certainly would have done in the present day to her ear that word had meaning except that of particular and meaning which we still attach to its relativ nicet new friend forsooth said christie s father with smile and who is she sweet heart is it mistress final s niece that came to visit her this last week oh father tis somebody er so much grander only think the master s daughter mistress pandor roberts came with her aunt mistress holland and mistress holland went on to cranbrook and took aunt tabitha with was here when she and mistress pandor tarried with and talked till her aunt came back to fetch her oh she is sweet maid and i love her all well by emily sarah holt https hall looked rather grave he had kept himself and even more his christie from the societ y of outsiders safety s sake either of them to be known gospeller the name then given to the true protestants would be dangerous thing their liberties if not their lives pandor roberts was the daughter of man who once protestant had conformed to the romanised form of religion restored by queen mary and her uncle was one of the magistr ates on the cranbrook bench roger was sorry to hear that one so nearly allied to these dangerous people had found his little violet under the leaves where he had hoped that she was safely hidden sharp pang shot through his heart the dread possibilit y rose before him of his delicate little girl being carried away to share the comfortless prison of his sister such treatment would most likely kill her very soon f or himself he would ha ve cared far less but christie he was puzzled how to answer christie s praises of pandor he did not wish to throw cold water on the child s delight nor to damage her newly found friend in her eyes but neither did he wish to drag her into the thorn y path wherein he had to walk himself hedge her round with perpetual cautions and fears and terrors lest she should let slip some word that might be used to their hurt an old verse ye gentlemen of england that sit at home at ease ye little know the miseries and dangers of the seas and it might be said with even greater ye men and women ye boys and girls of free peaceful protestant england ye little know the dangers of life in lands where popish priests rule nor the miseries that you will have to endure if they ev er gain the ascendancy here again roger hall had never heard dr aberneth y s wise when you don t know what to nothing but in this emergency he acted on that principle i trust my dear heart he said quietly that it may please the lord to make thee and this y oung gentlewoman blessing to each other oh it will i know father said christie quite unsuspicious of the course of her father s thoughts only think father she told first thing pretty nigh that she loved the lord jesus and wanted to be like him so you see we couldn t each other an y hurt could we roger smiled r ather sadly i am scarce so sure of that my christie satan can set snares even them that love the lord but tis true they be not so like to slip they that not is this young mistress she that dwelt way from home some y ears back or she is father she hath dwelt away in the shires with her grandmother these five years and there was good man told not his gave her counsel and he said to god s work is to god s that is good father isn t it good and v ery true sweeting roger hall had natur ally all the contempt of trueborn man of kent the dwellers in the shires which practically meant everybody in england who all well by emily sarah holt https native of kent but he knew that god had said he that despiseth his neighbour sinneth so he said in his heart get thee behind satan to the bad feeling and went on to wonder who the good man might be had pandor told the name of that man half roger s doubts and terrors would have taken flight the name of master john bradford of manchester martyr who eighteen months before had glorified the lord in the would have been an immediate passport to his confidence but pandor knew the danger of saying more than was needful and silently suppressed the name of her good counsellor some days elapsed before roger was again able to visit canterbury they were very busy just then at the works and his constant presence was required but when february began the pressure was past and on the first in that month which was candlemas day he rode to the metropolitan city of his count y on another visit to alice on his arm he carried basket which held bottle of thick cream dozen eggs and roll of butter and he came through canterbury he added to these country luxuries the town dainties of bag of dates and half pound each of those costly spices much used and liked at that cloves nutmeg and cinnamon on these articles he spent 7 shillings 8 pence the dates 3 shillings cinnamon 2 shillings 6 pence cloves and 1 shilling 6 pence nutmegs lastly he bought sugarloaf then an unusual luxury which cost him 7 pence the basket was now quite full and leaving his horse at the star inn he went up to the prison and struck with his dagger on the great bell which was then the gener al mode of ringing it every man except labourers carried dagger the porter had become so accustomed to the sight of roger that he usually opened the door him at once with nod of greeting but this morning when he looked from the wicket to see who it was he did not open the door but stood silently behind it roger wondered what this new style of conduct meant may i within b y your good lea ve to see m y sister he ask ed you may within if you desire to tarry here by my lord s good leave said the porter but y ll not see y our sister why what s ado ask ed roger in consternation removed answered the porter shortly whither ask questions and i ll tell y lies was the pro verbial reply lack can i find out the porter elev ated his ey ebrows and shrugged his shoulders come within moment said he roger obeyed and the porter drew him into his lodge where he spoke in cautious whisper master hall you be an honest man and though i am here found yet i trust so am if you be likewise wise man you will find somewhat to keep you at home the future whither mistress benden is now taken i could not tell you if i would but this can i say you ll follow if you have not care be ruled by that am dealing by you by friend and keep out of canterbury when you are out and let that be soon you may your good stuff leave it an you will all well by emily sarah holt https potkin but if you tarry here or return and be taken say not you were not w arned now void your bask et and go like man dazed or in dream roger hall slowly emptied his basket of the good things which he had brought alice he was willing enough that rachel potkin should have those or any other comforts he could bring her but that basket had been packed under christie s eyes and in part by christie s hands and the child had delighted herself in the thought of aunt alice s pleasure in every item and when at last the roll of butter was lifted out and behind it the eggs which it had confined in safe corner and roger came to the two tiny eggs which christie had put in with special care saying now father you ll be sure to tell aunt alice those eggs were laid by my own little hen and she must eat them her own self because i sent them to her roger took out the eggs of christie s hen he could hardly restrain sob which was partly the child s coming disappo intment and partly caused by his own anxious suspense and distress the porter had not spoken very plainly had probably avoided doing so on it was sufficiently manifest that the authorities had their eyes on roger himself and that he ran serious risk of arrest if he remained in canterbury but what had they done with alice he must find her whatev er became of him he must look alice roger turned away from the gate of the gaol sick at heart he scarcely remembered even to thank the friendly porter and turned back to repair the omission if you be thankful to was the porter s significant answer look you take my counsel slowly if he were walking in dream and scarcely knew where he was going roger made his way back to the star there all was bustle and commotion some people of high rank had just arrived on pilgrimage to the shrine of saint thomas of canterbury or rather to the place where the shrine had stood in past ages king henry the eighth had destro yed the shrine and soldier had rattled down proud becket s glassy bones but the spot where it had been was considered holy and the poor deluded people even yet sometimes came to worship there and to make their painful way up the pilgrims stairs which they had to ascend on their knees those stairs are now to be seen in canterbury cathedr al worn by the thousands of knees which went up them the poor creatures fancying that by this means they would obtain pardon of their sins or earn seat in hea ven the bustle in the inn rather favoured roger s escape he mounted his horse tied the basket to his saddle and rode out of wincheap gate wondering all the while how he could discover the place to which alice had been removed and how he should tell christie he met several people on the road but noticed none of them and reached his own house without having exchanged word with any one he knew he let himself in and with sinking heart opened the parlour door dear heart master hall said the voice of collet pardue who was seated by christie s couch but there s ill news in y our face what s ado prithee oh f ather is aunt alice sick cried christie roger came round to the couch and knelt down one hand clasping that of his little girl and the other tenderly laid upon her all well by emily sarah

done her work but aunt tabitha urged christie her father sat in silence and she felt herself bound to defend him have you forgotten what the porter said to father if they pack nonsense snorted aunt tabitha he would fain keep him from continual coming and he spake out the first thing that came in his head that s all none but babe like thee should take any note of such rubbish can t you speak up roger hall or did y drop y our tongue where y left y our wits methinks you have sufficiency us both tabitha said roger quietly leaving it uncertain whether he alluded to the tongue or the wits mean y to go again that can not i y et say i lack time to think to pr ay likewise lack time to think gramercy how long doth man want to gather up his wits together i should have thought of fifty things whilst i rode back from canterbury so i did t abitha but i wis not y et which w the right ay you re br ave hand at thinking but i w ant to that will i likewise so soon i have thought out what is best

i ll give him some at he ll enjoy if he skrike not afore i ve done with leaving her sentence the more expressiv its incompleteness mistress tabitha stalked out of the room and the house not pausing an y farewells father said christie little fearfully aren t you feared aunt tabitha shall get into prison the w ay she talks and runs right at things nay christie i scarce am said r oger he knew that faithful is brought to the stake in vanity fair more frequently than talkativ in the at briton s mead mr benden was sitting down to his solitary supper of the result of his application to the bishop he had not yet heard he really imagined that if roger hall could be kept out of her way alice would yield and all that he wished he gave her credit principle indeed like many in his day he would have laughed at the bare idea of woman having any principle or being able to stand calmly and firmly without being instigate d and supported by man roger therefore in his eyes was the obstacle in the way of alice s submission he did not in the least realise that the real obstacle against which he was striving w the holy spirit of god to man in mr benden s position who moreo ver had always been an epicure his meals were relief and an enjoyment he was then less troubled by noxious thoughts than at any other time it was with sigh of something like satisfaction that he sat down to supper unfolded his napkin and tucked it into his doublet muttered hurried grace and helped himself to the buttered eggs which mary had sent up light and hot he was just putting down the pepper when he became aware of something on the settle in the corner which he could not fairly see and did not understand mr benden was rather he peered with eyes half shut at the unknown object what s that he said half aloud that responded by neither sound nor motion it looked very like human being but who could possibly be seated on his settle at this late hour without his knowing it mr benden came to the conclusion that it would be foolish to disturb himself and spoil an excellent supper the sake of ascertai ning that mary had forgotten to put away his cloak which was most likely the thing in the corner he would look at it after supper he took up his spoon and was in the act of conveying it to his mouth when the uncann y object suddenly changed its attitude saints bless us and lo ve us ejaculated mr benden dropping the spoon he really was not at all concerned about the saints loving him otherwise he would have behaved differently to his wife but the words were the first to occur to him the unknown thing was still again and after another long stare which brought him information mr benden picked up the spoon and this time succeeded in conveying it to his lips at that moment the apparition spok all well by emily sarah holt https edward benden it said y call y ourself christian mr benden s first gasp of horror that the hobgoblin should address him by name was succeeded b y second of relief he recognised the v oice bless the saints he said to himself it s only t his next sensation was one of resentment what business had tabitha to steal into his house in this way startling him half out of his wits he began his supper these mixed sentiments lent sulky tone to his voice he answered that he was under the impression he had some claim to that char acter because said the apparition coolly i don never thought you were said mr benden grimly turning the tables on the enem y who had left him chance to it tabitha rose and adv anced to the table where is alice she demanded how should i know answered mr benden hastily shovelling into his mouth another spoonful of eggs without notion what they tasted like in the gaol i reckon you are best to go and see if y d fain know i m not her k eeper you re not did i not hear you swear an oath to god almight y to keep her in sickness and in health that s how you keep your vows is it i ve kept mine better than so but being thus ignorant of what you should know better than other folks may be it shall serve you to hear that she is not in the gaol nor none wist where she is saving i guess yon dotipole men call dick dover he and satan know very lik i count they took counsel about it mr benden laid down his spoon and looked up at tabitha tabitha i wist nought of this i ensure y neither heard i of it aforetime i he took another mouthful to stop the words that were coming it would hardly be wise to let t abitha know what he had said to the bishop sit you down and give leave to help you to these eggs he said hospitably in appear ance politically in fact i ll not eat nor drink in your house was the stern reply must i then take it that dick dover hath acted of his own head and without any incitement from you poor mr benden he felt himself fairly caught he did not quite want to tell point blank falsehood they be good eggs tabitha and mall wist well how to dress them he urged you were best you were best answer my question edward benden did you in any wise excite yon mitred scoundrel to this act your language tabitha doth verily shame mitred scoundrel in good sooth fear you not to be brought afore the justices all well by emily sarah holt https i fear nought so much i fear you are slippery snake well roaring lion said tabitha in grim defiance of natur al history answer my question or i ll make you until that moment mr

succade to follow y our eggs which y shall ha ve if you demerit it what mean y sister t abitha let be y our slim y coaxing w ays answer m y question like all bullies mr benden was coward with woman of tabitha s type he had never before had to deal at such close quarters alice either yielded to his wishes or stood quietly firm and gener ally silent he began to feel consider able alarm tabitha was powerful woman and he was man of only moder ate strength briton s mead was not within call of any other house and its master had an unpleasant conviction that to summon mary to his aid would not impro ve his case it was desirable to compromise with tabitha the only way that he could see to it was to deny his action if he did commit sin in speaking falsely he said to himself it was tabitha s fault forcing him to it and father bastian would absolv him easily considering the circumstances tabitha i did not sa y word to the bishop you expect to believ you after all that fencing and skulking under hedges then i don t if you d said it fair out at first y be i might may be i mightn but i don t now never whit and i think you d best eat the succade i brought you i believ you demerit it and if you

thyself say i pay dues to the priest and take thought thine own soul the speak er was mr justice roberts and he sat at supper in his brother s house one of small family party which consisted beside the brothers of their sister mistress collen wood mistress grena holland gertrude and pandora the speech was characteristic of the speak er the justice was by means bad man men all of them not go very straight in the right he made one mistak which many are making in our own day he valued peace more highly than truth his decalogue was monologue consisting but of one commandment your duty what man s duty was the justice did not pause to define had he been required to so his dissection of that difficult subject would probably have run in three groo to church giv alms k eep out of quarrels it were verily good world master justice wherein every man should his duty was the answer of mistress grena delivered in that slightly prim and didactic fashion which w char acteristic of her what is duty concisely asked mistress collen wood who was by some ten years the elder of her brothers and therefore the eldest of the compan gertrude s eyes were dancing with amusement p andor only look ed interested duty said mr r oberts the host is that which is due to whom inquired his sister to them unto whom he oweth it was the reply first to god after him to all which of us doth that said mistress collen wood softly looking round the table mistress grena shook her head in w ay which said v ery few i had gertrude lived three hundred years later she would have said what now she only thought i am sure i my but in 1557 young ladies were required to hear see and say nought and one of them to join unask ed in the conversation of her elders would have been held to be shockingly indecorous the rule girls behaviour was too strict in that day but if little of it could be infused into the very lax code of the present time when little misses offer their opinions on subjects of which they know nothing and unblushingly differ from or even contradict their mothers too often without rebuk it would be decided impro vement on social manners which of the folks in these parts be not doing their duty asked mr roberts of his brother you know benden of briton s mead replied the all well by emily sarah holt https by sight i am not well acquaint with him is he not an hard man scarce well lik ed said his sister true enough you shall say ere my tale come to an end this benden hath decent woman enough all men confess save that she is bitten somewhat by certain heretical notions that the priest can not win her to lay by will not come to mass and so forth but in all other fashions of good repute and what doth this brute her husband but go himself to the bishop and i ensure you beg his lordship that this his wife may be arrest and lodged in prison and in prison she is and hath so been now these three or four months on the sworn information of her own husband tis monstrous truly most shocking said mistress grena cutting up the round of beef the lady of the house alw ays did the carving ah saith the old proverb there is worse pestilen ce than familiar enem y quoted the host well continued the justice with an amused look but now cometh good jest whereof i heard but this mistress benden hath two brothers named oger and of whom dwelleth at frittenden and the other at yon corner house in staplehurst nigh to the second acre close why to be sure he is y our manager had i forgot mr roberts nodded pandor had pricked up her ears at the name of hall and now began to listen intently mistress benden of whom she heard the first time must be an aunt of her protégée little christabel this thomas hall hath wife by name tabitha that the lads hereabout call tabby and by all accounts right cat with claws is she she i hear went up to briton s mead days gone or maybe something more and gave good master benden taste of her horsewhip that he hath since kept his ather i take it from sulkiness than soreness yet i dare be bound she handled him neatly tabitha is woman of strong build and lithe belike that i would lief not be horsewhipped by howbeit what shall come thereof know i not very like she thought it should serve to move him to set mistress alice free but she may find and he belike that tis easier to set stone down the hill than to stay it the matter is now in my lord of dover s hands and without mistress tabitha try her whip on both gentlemen laughed pandora was deeply interested she recalled little christie s delicate words that aunt alice was away at present the child evidently would not say more pandor made up her mind that she would go and see christie again soon possible and mean while she listened any information that she might giv her what is like to come of the woman then said mr roberts apart from mistress tabitha and her whip scarce release i count said the justice gravely she hath been moved from the gaol and that doubtless meaneth had into str aiter k eeping poor fools said his brother rather pit yingly than scornfully ay tis strange in very deed they can not let be this foolish meddling with matters too high them if the woman would but conform and go to church all well by emily sarah holt https her womanish fantasies should very like be overlook ed good lack i can man not believ he list yet hold his tongue and be quiet and not bring down the la ws on his head concluded the justice somewhat testily there was pause during which all were silent very various motiv es mr roberts was thinking rather sadly that the only choice offere d to men in those days was choice of evils he had never wished to er would have done so had he been let alone but man must look out his safety and take care of his propert course he must and if the authorities made it impossible him to so with good conscience why the fault was theirs not his thus argued mr roberts forgetting that the man makes poor bargain who gains the whole world and loses himself the justice and gertrude were simply enjoying their supper scruples of any kind disturbed their slumb ering consciences mistress collen wood s face gave indication of her thoughts pandor was reflecting chiefly upon christabel but there was one present whose conscience had been asleep and was just waking to painful life nearly four years had grena holland soothed her many misgivings by some such reasoning that of mr justice roberts she had conformed outwardly had not merely abstained from contradictory speeches but had gone to mass had attended the confessional had bowed down before images of wood and stone and all the time had comforted herself by imagining that god saw her heart and knew that she did not really believ in any of these things but only acted thus safety s sake now all at once she knew not how it came on her by flash of lightning that she was on the road that leadeth to destruction and not content with that was bearing her young nieces along with her she loved those girls if she had been their own mother grave and undemonstr ative she was she would almost have given her life either but especially pandor who in face and to some extent in character resembled her dead mother the sister who had been the darling of grena holland s heart she recalled with keen pain the look on pandor s face she had followed her to mass on the first after her return from lancashire grena knew well that at shardeford hall her mother s house in lancashire pandor would never have been required to attend mass but would have been taught that it was fond fable and dangerous deceit and now she considered that look had passed from the girl s face she went silently not eagerly on the one hand yet unprotestingly even by look on the other forward into the possible future went grena s the prison and the chamber and the public disgrace and the awful death of fire how could she bear those either herself or p andor these painful meditations were brok en in upon b y remark from the justice there is some strong ale brewing i warrant you some of our great doctors and teachers of this vicinage i heard t other day from one that shall be nameless i would not mention the matter but we be all friends and good catholics mistress collen wood s eyes were lifted moment from her plate but then went down again in silence well i heard say two men of my lord cardinal s had already

staplehurst except that pandor told her aunt that christabel was an invalid child and that her father was the manager at the works christie who of course was always at home was rejoiced to see her friend and mistress collen wood inquired closely into her ailments ending with the suggestion which she desired might be conveyed to her father that christie should rub her limbs with oil of swallows and take medicine compounded of plantain water and powder of swine s all well by emily sarah holt https father s in the house said christie he had to return back some papers the master desired roger hall confirmed her words by coming into the room in few minutes with the papers in his hand which he had been sent to seek he made reverence to his master s relativ es master hall said mrs collen wood i would gladly have word with you touching your little maid s ailments roger detected her desire to say something to him out of christie s hearing and led her to the kitchen which was just then empty nell was busy in the house outside i pray you to bar the door said mrs collen wood roger obeyed rather wondering at the request mrs collen wood shortly told him that she thought the oil of swallows might strengthen christ ie s limbs and the medicine impro ve her gener al health but she so quickly dismissed that subject that it was plain she had come something else roger waited respectfully till she spok speech seemed to be difficult to the lady twice she looked up and appeared to be on the point of speaking and twice her eyes dropped her face flushed but her voice remained silent t last she master hall suffer to ask if y ha ve friends in an y other count y roger w consider ably surprised at the question i have my mistress said he married sister that dwelleth in norfolk but i have not seen her these man y he thought she must mean that christie s health would be better in some other climate which was strange idea to him at time when change of air was considered almost dangerous norfolk scarce serve said the lady in timid hesitating manner the air of the green yard at norwich where stood the bishop s prison heretics is not er good i think not of your little maid s health master hall but of your roger hall was on the point of asserting with some perplexit y and much amaz ement that his health was perfect and he required neither change nor medicine when the real object of these faltering words sudde nly flashed on him his heart seemed to leap into his mouth then to retreat to its place beating fast my mistress he said earnestly i took not at the first your kindly meaning rightly but i count i so now if so be i thank you more than words may tell but i must abide at my post my sister alice is not yet found and should i be taken from the child voice trembled moment god must have care of i will have care of her in that case said mrs collen wood master hall we may speak freely what you are i am now i have put my life in your hands and i trust y to be true all well by emily sarah holt https i will guard it mine own answered roger warmly and i give you the most heartiest thanks my mistress that man wot how to utter but if i may ask you be an y more in danger my brother and master white and mistress all be in danger was the startling answer that hold with us but the one only name that i ha ve heard beside y ours is mine hostess of the white hart mistress final i reckoned so much i will have word with her if it may be on my way back to cranbrook and bid her send word to the others alack the day how long is satan to reign and wrong to triumph so long god will replied mrs collen wood so long his church hath need of the cleansing physic shall it be ministered to her when she is made clean and white and tried longer god grant friend that you and i may not fail him when the summons cometh the master calleth thee amen said r oger hall in the parlour p andor said to dear child thou mayest speak freely to of thine aunt alice i know all touching her mistress p andor wot y where she is pandor was grieved to find from christie s eager exclamation that she had howev er innocently roused the child s hopes only to be disappointed my dear heart she said tenderly not that truly i did but signif y that i knew the manner of her entreatment and where she hath been lodged father can t find her anywhere said christie sorrowfully he went about two whole ys but he could hear nothing of her at all our father in heaven knows where she is my child he shall not lose sight of her be well assured but she can t see him urged christie tearfully truth sweeting therefore rather blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believ consider how hard the blessed paul was tried and how hard he must ha ve found faith and y et how fully he did rely on our sa viour christ i don t think saint paul was ever tried this way said christ ie in her simplicit y and his sister s son knew where he was and could get at him they weren t ill off and f poor old jacob did not know where joseph w suggested p andor well ay admitted christie but jacob was an old man he wasn t little maid and joseph came all right after all beside he was lad and could stand things aunt alice isn t strong and she hasn t been nobody s white child favourite joseph was i am sure uncle edward never made her coat of many colours mistress pandor is it very wicked of to feel if i could not bear to look at uncle edward and hope that he will never never never come to see us any more all well by emily sarah holt https tis not wicked to hate man s sinful deeds dear heart but we have need to beware that we hate not the sinner himself i can t tell how to manage that said christie i can t put uncle edward into one end of my mind and the ill way he hath used dear aunt alice into the other he s bad wick ed man or he nev er could ha ve done he has suppose he be the very worst man that ever lived and i misdoubt if he be supposing it wouldst thou not y et wish that god should forgiv him well ay i suppose i would said christie in rather uncertain tone but if uncle edward s going to heaven i hope the angels will keep him good way off aunt alice and father and i don t think it would be so pleasant if he were there pandor smiled we will lea ve that sweet heart till thou be there she said and just she spoke mrs collen wood returned to the parlour she chatted pleasantly little while with christie and bade her not lose heart concerning her unt alice the lord will his best his own my child she said they took leave of christabel but after all mind thou his best is not always our best nay at times it is that which seems to us the worst yet i cast doubt we shall bless him it and justify all his ways when we stand on the mount of god and look back along the road that we have traversed all the paths of the lord are mercy and truth unto such k eep his co venant and his testimonies some such comfort those words of god can give was sorely needed by roger hall to use graphic expression of his day he was beat out of heart he had visited all the villages within some distance and had tramped to and fro in canterbury and could hear nothing he had not yet hinted to any one his own terrible apprehension that alice might have been removed to london trial if so she would come into the brutal and relentless hands of bishop bonner and little enough hope was there in that case the only chance humanly speaking then lay in the occasional visits paid by cardinal pole to smithfie ld the purpose of rescuing from bonner s noble army of martyrs the doomed who belonged to his own diocese and that w poor hope indeed there were two important left in february and both these roger spent in canterbury despite the warning of his impending arrest if he ventured in that direction on the latter of these two he paid special attentio n to the cathedr al precincts it was possible that alice might be imprisoned in the house of one of the canons or prebendaries and if so there was faint possibilit y that she might be better treated than in the gaol everywhere he listened her voice at every window he gazed earnestly in the hope of seeing her face he saw and heard nothing he turned away to go home on the evening of saint matthias it struck him that perhaps if he were to come very early in the morning the town would be more silent and there might be better likelihood of detecting the sound of one voice among many but suppose she were kept in solitary confinement then could he hope to hear it all well by emily sarah holt https very was roger he rode home he met two or three friends who asked sympathetically news yet master hall and he felt unable to respond ex cept b y mournful shak of the head well be sure what can have come of the poor soul added emmet wilson and roger could giv answer what could ha ve become of alice benden chapter nineteen eureka in the court where the prebenda ries chambers were situated within the cathedr al close at canterbury was an underground vault known monda y s hole here the stocks were kept but the place was very rarely used prison paling four feet and half in height and three feet from the window cut off all glimpses of the outer world from any person within little short straw was strewn on the floor between the stocks and the wall which formed the only bed of any one there imprisoned it was place where man of any humanit y would scarcely have left his dog cold damp dreary depressing bey ond measure that litter of straw on the damp stones had been five weary weeks the bed of alice benden she was allowed change of clothes and all the pittance given her food was halfpenn y worth of bread and farthing s worth of drink at her own request she had been permitted to receiv her whole allowance in bread and water not over clean nor fresh was supplied drinking living creature came near her save her keeper who was the at the cathedr we except the vermin which held high carnival in the vault and were there in extensiv numbers it was dreadful place any human being to live in how dreadful an educated and delicate gentlewoman accustomed to the comforts of civilisation it is not easy to imagine but to the coarser tortures of physical depriv ation and suffering had been added the more refined torments of heart and soul during four of those five weeks all god s waves and billows had gone over alice benden she felt herself forsak en of god and man of mind like the slain that lie in the even by the lord her shepherd one visitor she had during that time who had by means forgotten her satan has an excellent memory and never lacks leisure to tempt god s children he paid poor alice great deal of attention how he asked her was it possible that just god not to say merciful saviour could have allowed her to come into such misery had the lord s hand waxed short here were the persecutors many of them ungodly men robed in soft silken raiment and faring sumptuously every day their beds were made of the finest down they had all that heart could wish while she lay upon dirty straw in this damp hole not creature knowing what had become of her was this all she had receiv ed the reward of serving god had she not tried to his will and to walk before him with perfect heart and this was what she got it from him who could have swept away her persecutors by word and lifted her b y another to the height of luxury and happiness poor alice was overwhelmed her bodily which satan may always be trusted to take her less fit to cope with him and time all well by emily sarah holt https not guess who it was that suggested all these wrong and miser able thoughts she griev ously bewailed herself and people often nursed her distress if it were something v ery dear and precious but god had not forgotten alice benden she was not going to be whom christ died she was only to be purified and made white and tried he led her to find comfort in his own word the richest of earthly comforters one night alice began to repeat to herself the psalm it seemed just made her it was the cry of sore heart shut in by enemies and shut out from hope and pleasure w not that just her case why art thou so full of heaviness my soul and why art thou so disquieted within put th y trust in god little reliev ed she turned next to the psalm she had bible nothing but what her memory gave her ah what would have become of alice benden in those dark hours had her memory been filled with all kinds of folly and not with the pure unerring w ord of god this psalm exactly suited her will the lord absent himself ever will he be more entreated is his mercy clean gone ever is his promise come utterly to an end evermore hath god forgotten to be gracious and will he shut up his kindness in displeasure and i said it is mine infirmit y but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most highest light suddenly flashed clear and warm into the weak low dark heart of poor lonely alice it is mine infirmit y not god s infirmit god s forgetfulness alice never that it seemed just if somebody said to her it is only your poor blind heart here in the dark that can not see the joy and deliverance that are coming to must come to all god s people but he who dwells in the immortal light and beholds the end from the beginning knows how to come and set you when to come and sa ve the tune changed now satan was driven away the enem y whom alice benden had seen that day and from whom she had suffered so sorely she should see again more ev er from that hour all w joy and hope i will magnif y thee god m y king and pr aise th y name ev er and ev er that was the song she sang through her prison bars in the early morning of the 25th of february the voice of joy and thanksgiving reached where the moan of pain had not been able to penetr ate to an intently listening ear few yards from the prison then an answering v oice of delight came to her from without alice alice i ha ve found thee alice looked up to see her brother roger s head and shoulders above the paling which hid all but strip of sky from her gaz hast thou been all these weeks r oger that have i my dear heart ever since thou

out of the precincts and into the first baker s shop he saw where he bought small loaf of bread into it he pushed five fourpenn y pieces then called groats and very commonly current then he fixed the loaf on the end of his staff and so passed it through the bars to alice this w all he could my poor dear heart hast thou had compan y in all this time i have had satan s compan y weary while she

thou shouldst not tarry roger came within sight of staplehurst on his return he saw woman walking rapidly along the road to meet him and when he came little nearer he perceiv ed that it was tabitha gently urging his horse forward they met in few minutes the expression of tabitha s face alarmed roger greatly she was not wont to look so moved and troubled grim and sarcastic even angry he had seen her many times but grieved and was not like tabitha roger s first fear was that she had come to give him some terrible news of christie yet her opening words were not those of pain or terror the lord

words well if he had said faithful yourself mr roberts might have assented with an interior conviction that his own faithfulness was not without its limits he left such loophole of escape mr roberts could only reply that he entertained similar hope but whatev er all well by emily sarah holt https might be his expectations on that score were not extensiv mr roberts had the nature of the ostrich and imagined that if he shut his eyes to the thing he wished to avoid seeing he thereb y annihilated its existence deep down in his heart he held consider able doubts concerned more than one member of his family but the doubts were uncomfortable so he put them to bed drew the curtains and told them to be good doubts and go to sleep when children are treated in this manner mothers and nurses know that sometimes they go to sleep but sometimes they don t and doubts are very much like children in that respect occasionally they consent to be smothered up and shelved aside at other times they break out and become provokingly noisy good deal depends on the vitalit y of both the doubts and the children mr roberts s doubts and they went together all his household were not in conformable state of mind had hitherto gone to sleep at his bidding but lately they had been more difficult to manage he was uneasy about his sister mrs collen wood and with diminution of his affection her was beginning to realise that his mind would be reliev ed when she ended her visit and went home he feared her influence over pandor gertrude he had fears he knew and so did the priest that gertrud was not the sort of girl to indulge in abstract speculations religious or other wise so long her new gown was not made in last year s fashion and her er did not put her off with venice ribbon when she wanted tours it mattered nothing at all to gertrude whether she attended mass or went to the nearest conventicle nor had the fears spread yet towards mistress grena who still appeared at mass on sunda y and though with man y inward misgivings which she nev er spok perhaps the priest had sharper eyes than the master of primrose croft but his tongue had lost nothing of its softness when he next and how long m y son does y our sister mistress collen wood abide with y not much longer now father replied the unhapp y mr roberts with private resolution that his answer should be true if he could mak it so mr bastian left that unpleasant topic and proceeded to carry his queries into the servants department mr roberts growing more reliev ed he proceeded he had never observ ed any want of conformit y among his servants he assured the priest so far he knew all were loyal to the catholic church by that term both gentlemen meant not the universal body of christian believ ers the real signification of the word but that minorit y which blindly obeys the pope and being minorit y is of course not catholic nor universal when mr roberts s apprehensions had thus been entirely lulled to rest the wily priest suddenly returned to the charge i need not i am fully ensured he said in his suave manner ask any questions touching y our daughters of that father answered mr roberts quickly you must be better judge than but i most unfeignedly trust that neither of my maids hath given you any trouble b y neglect of her religious duties gertrude indeed is mistress gertrude hath not given trouble replied the priest her worst failing is one common to certain lack of soberness but i can not conceal from you my son that i am under some uneasiness of mind touching her sister all well by emily sarah holt https bastian s uneasiness was nothing to that of the man he was engaged in tormenting the terrified mous does not struggle more eagerly to escape the claws of the cat than the suffering father of pandor to avoid implicating her in the ey es of his insinuating confessor forsooth father you indeed distress said he if pandor have heard any foolish talk on matters of religion i would gladly break her from communication with any such of her acquaintan ce can have been thus truly i know not of any and methought my sister grena kept the maids full diligently that they should not fall into unseemly ways i will speak under your good leave with both of them and will warn pandor that she compan y not with such seem like to have any power ver her evil well said my son responded the priest with slight twinkle in his eye therein shall you well and in especial if you report to the names of any that you shall suspect to have the maiden and now methinks i must be on my way home mr roberts devoutly

that the basins should be there without fail in an hour and having now reduced his goods to load of much smaller dimensions he intimated that they might well be moving the goods having been duly

were days when everybody knew that if man s meaning were not simple and apparent there was probably some reason why he dared not speak too plainly and it was perilous to ask an explanation mr roberts looked up into his manager s face and at once guessed his meaning he was seriously alarmed to see it how had roger hall become possessed of that dangerous secret which might bring him to prison if it were known the penalt y merely aiding and abetting heretic was perpetual prison those who gave cup of cold water to one of christ s little ones did it at the peril of their own libert let us pause

given handful of gold to know he might have chance of seeing month to come faint idea of hiding himself in the shrubs crossed his mind moment but he could not stay there an indefinite time and the priest would in all probabilit y wait him if it were he whom he meant to see it would be better to go forward and get it over but it was with fervid wish that it were over that mr r oberts went on and deferentially saluted his r ector that reverend gentleman thorou ghly understood his man had it been possible to gauge the human soul with thermometer he could have guessed with accur acy how it would read he met him not with severity but with deep gravity which conveyed the idea that something serious required discussion and that he earnestly hoped the culprit would be able to clear himself of the charge in the hall they were met by mistress grena and gertrude who had seen them coming and who came forward in duty bound to show extra respect to their spiritual pastor the genuine spiritualit y was more than dubious but that did not matter he was spiritual person the person was exceedingly unspiritual the priest gave blessing to the ladies with two fingers extended in style which must require some practice and at mistress grena s request sat down with them to supper during the meal the conversation was gener al though the priest retained his serious aspect of something unpleasant to come the heavy part of the supper was over and cheese with late apples malaga raisins and jordan almonds had made their appear ance the ladies prepared to withdr aw mistress holland said the rector i beseech you to tarry yet little season adding to gertrude i need not detain y m y daughter gertrude escaped with great satisfaction those two are going to catch it she said to herself i am glad i am

with emphasis i left word that i would call to see her this morrow here am i and what have i now learned that she left this house without so much word of excuse not to say beseechment of pardon when she knew that i purposed having speech of his voice became more stern is this the manner wherein ye deal with the ministers of holy church truly had i just cause to suspect your fidelit y to her this

truly unwelcome unto what sa y ye in extenuation thereof we are verily sorry father came quietly from mistress grena that meet apology hath been offered unto you this discourtesy and we pray you of your grace and goodness right gentilly to accept the same even now truly the matter stands thus our sister mistress collen wood had in purpose to tarry with us divers days longer but tidings came unto her the which caused her to hasten her departure not tarrying so much one night more and she had desired to take pandor withal it was needful that her departure should be hastened likewise you wot well good father i am assured the bustle and business caused by such sudden resolv and the little time left thought therein but any consequent lack of respect unto yourself and your holy office we are full sorry and right humbly entreat y of pardon mr roberts breathed more freely he thought the woman s wit was about to prevail and to salv over the offence the priest on his part perceiv ed with

easily have forgat the matter i need not keep you longer from your household duties god grant you good ev en mistress grena had resource but to withdr aw in answer to this dismissal her heart filled with sore forebodings she had hoped the excuse might be held to cover the whole family but it was evident the priest had intention of accepting it including the male portion thereof she passed mr

the escape of the fugitiv es he laid himself open to the charge of aiding and abetting if he denied it he practically denied also the truth of grena s defence at that moment he would have given every

even that slight contact with the unchanging rock steadied the wavering feet he must speak truth and uphold grena father he said in changed tone my sister told you true the journey was hastened and that suddenly the change in his tone puzzled the priest what had come to the man in that momentary interv al to nerv him thus anew how came the news m y son mr roberts w thankfully able to answer that

he had anticipated an easy victory and found himself unaccountably baffled in the present day english gentleman would bear such questioning by priest the latter would very soon be told in howev er civil language that an englishman s house was his castle and that he held himself responsible his actions to god alone but the iron terror of rome was then over every heart priest could be defied nor his questions evaded with impunit if those days ever come back it will be the fault and the misery of englishmen who would not take warning by the past but who suffered the enem y to creep in again

at canterbury little after daybreak the next morning he found he had expected that while the message had been sent in the name of cardinal pole it was really the bishop of dover who required his attendance the bishop wanted to talk with the parish priest concerning the accused persons from his parish he read their names from paper whereon he had them noted john fishcock butcher nicholas white ironmonger nicholas pardue worker alice benden gentlewoman barbar final widow innkeeper sens bradbridge widow emmet wilson worker s wife touching alice benden said the bishop i require note at your

the butcher is he like to be persuaded or methinks nay my lord yet am i not so full sure of him of some other the two nicholases trow are surer of the twain you should soon shake an ancient oak white

laughed emmet wilson plain woman past middle age of small learning yet good wit by nature you shall not mo ve her holy f ather or i mistak these heretics what labour they give us said dick of dover rather testily tis passing strange they can not conform and have done with it and be content to enjoy their liv es and liberties in peace having principle himself the bishop was unable to compreh end its existence in other people mr bastian was shade that he possessed much principle but that he could realise the fact of its existence there is one other point holy father said he seeing that the bishop was about to dismiss him whereon if it stand with your lordship s pleasure i would humbly seek y our counsel the bishop rubbed his hands and desired mr bastian to proceed the labour which the heretics gave him was very well to complain of but to him the excitement of discovering new heretic was pleasur able the unearthing of fox to keen sportsman dick of dover having distinct religious convictions was not more actuated by personal enmit y to the persecuted heretic than the sportsman to all well by emily sarah holt https fox they both liked the run the excitement the risks and the

queen came in and ever sithence have i regarded him good catholic enough till of late when i am fallen to doubt it to my great concern and mr bastian proceeded to relate to the bishop all that he knew respecting the flight of the ladies and his subsequent unsatisfac tory interview with the heads of the family the bishop listened intently this young maid said he when the narrative was finished what said you was her gertrude then you account of faithful to holy church she hath ever been regular at mass and confession my lord and performeth all her duties well enough other matter methinks she is

the door behind them she could be heard going upstairs he into the garden by the back way few seconds there was dead silence in the room then the arras parted and concealed listener came out in those days rooms were neither papered nor painted they were either wainscoted high up the wall with panelled wood or simply washed and large pieces of tapestry hung round on heavy iron hooks this tapestry was commonly known arras from the name of the french town where it was chiefly woven and behind it since it stood forward from the wall was most convenient place spy the concealed listener came into the middle of the room her face worked with conflicting emotions she stood minute it were fighting out battle with herself at length she clenched her hand if the decision were reached and said aloud and passionately i will not that conclusion arrived at she went hastily but softly out of the room and closed the door noiselessly mistress grena was very busy in her own room secretly packing up such articles she had resolv ed to take in the event of her journey being made she had told margery the old housek eeper that she was going to be engage d and did not wish to be disturbed if any visitors came mistress gertrude could entertain them and she desired margery to transmit her commands to that effect to the young lady that gertrude herself would interrupt her she had very little fear they had few tastes and ideas in common gertrude would spend the afternoon in the parlour with her embroidery or her piano of that and was not likely to come near her this being the case mistress grena was startle d and disturbed to hear rap at her door trusting that it was mr roberts who wanted her and who was the only lik ely person she went to open it may i come in unt grena said all well by emily

gertrude brought there by something of more importance than usual well niece what is it aunt grena giv lea ve once to speak freely so my dear maid you and my father are talking of escape to shardeford but you scarce know whether to go or let tell you and trust my knowledge is costly matter let us go grena stood in amaz ed consternation she had said and believ ed that god would show them what to but the very last person in her world through whose lips she expected him to speak w gertrude r oberts told y an angel she gasped incoherently laugh short and unmirthful w the answer truly said gertrude it w fallen angel if it were what mean y niece this is passing str ange said grena in troubled tone aunt i have confession to make despise if you will you can not so more than i despise myself tis ill work despising one s self but i must and penalt y mine evil deeds i am forcing myself to own them to you you refuse to leave m y mother s sake to go to an ill end neither will i so lea ve when heard y so to speak gertrude not an hour since unt grena you were not present i was little y guessed it i w behind the arr wick ed mean dishonour able girl cried mistress grena in mixture of horror confusion and alarm i own it aunt grena said gertrude with quiet humilit y which was not natur al to her and which touched grena against her will but hear out i pray you tis of moment to us all that y should so silent inclination of her aunt s head gr anted her permission to proceed the last time that i went to shrift father bastian bade tell him if i knew of surety that you or my father had any thought to leave kent that could not i say of course and so much i told him then he bade be diligent and discover the same but after what fashion said i i ensure you that his meaning came not into mine head afore he spake it in plain language when at last i did conceiv that he would have to spy upon you at the first i was struck with horror you had so learned aunt grena that the bare thought of such thing was hateful unto this methinks he perceived and he set him to reason with that the command of holy church sanctified the act done her service which all well by emily sarah holt https been perchance unmeet to be done still i yielded not and then he told flat that without i did this thing he would not grant absolution of my sins then but not till then i gave way i hid behind the arras this morning looking that you should come to hold discourse in that chamber where saving meat you knew i was not wont to be i hated the work whit less than at the first but the fear of holy church bound i heard you say aunt grena s voice softened grena had rarely heard that you would not leave father and that you could not be happy touching i had mother save you and you would not cast aside to go to an ill end i saw that father reckoned it should be to your own hurt if you tarried and it struck to the heart that you should be thinking to serve the while i was planning how to betray you yet if father bastian refused to shrive what should come of and all at once i stood there heark ening word from the psalter bolted in upon verse that i mind mother caused to learn long time agone i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and so thou forgavest the wickedness of my then said i to myself what need i trouble if the priest will not shrive when i can go straight unto the lord and confess to him then came another verse if to answer that i wist father bastian should have brought forth in like case whatsoev er sins ye retain they are retained and whatsoev er ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in i could not i own all at once see my way through these they did look to say unto whom the priest that is the church denieth shrift the same hath forgiv eness of minute i was staggered till blind man came to help up aunt grena you mind that blind man in the ninth chapter of saint john s gospel he was cast forth of the church the church was in that day and it was when our lord heard that they had cast him forth that he sought him and bade him believ only on him the son of god you marvel aunt i may well see that such meditations these should come to your foolish maid gertrude but i was at point and an hard point belike i had to consider my ways whether i would or when i came to this trackless moor and wist not which way to go with precipice nigh at hand so now aunt grena i come to speak truth unto you and to confess that i have been wicked maid and fool and if you count more worth the serving or the saving i have demerited that you should thus account only if so be i beseech you save yourself gertrude s eyes were wet she turned way grena followed her and drew the girl into her arms my child she said i never held thee so well worth love and care now so be it we will go to shardeford chapter twenty nine whereof the hero is jack ay we must go then said mr roberts with awn sigh this discovery leaves us choice howso god and we may pardon the child father bastian will not so we must go ere he find it out and lea ve primrose croft to his fate father exclaimed gertrude suddenly i beseech you hear uncle anthon y conforms and he is kindly man could wish if he would come hither and have care of primrose croft though he held it by gift or under lease from you they should nev er think to disturb him all well by emily sarah holt https the maid s wit hath hit the nail on the head returned her father in high satisfaction but how shall i give him to know without letting forth our secret and once get it on paper and it might well be given to the town crier walls have ears saith the old saw but paper hath tongue and i can not tell him by word of mouth sith he is now at sandwich and turneth not home afore thursda elsewise that were good counsel ask true suggested mistress grena with smile the young wit is the readiest amongst us methinks under your correction father could you not write letter and entrust it to margery to be sent to uncle thursda y it into her hand the last minute afore we depart is she not trustworth y think y she is trustworth y enough if she be let be but i misdoubt if her wits should carry her safe through discourse with father bastian if he were bent on winning the truth from her i could trust osmund better that but i looked to take him withal give leave then father to walk down to uncle s if i wist not of his absence and slip the letter into one of his pockets he alway leaveth one of his gowns in the hall and if his martha were seized with cleaning fever whilst he is thence and turned out the pocket where should we then be nay true that shall not serve i can think of means but that you twain set forth wit without under guidance of osmund and that i follow going round by sandwich having there seen and adv ertised m y brother were there danger that w ay tom there is danger every way replied mr roberts with groan but maybe there is little that way any and i would fain save gertrude s inheritance if it may at the cost of your liberty father nay not so i entreat you cried gertrude with flash of that noble nature which seemed to have been awakened in her let mine inheritance go it will god wills gently put in mistress grena god wills repeated gertrude and k eep y safe mistress grena laid her hand on her brother s shoulder tom she said let us trust the lord in this matter draw you up if you will lease of primrose croft to the justice and leave it in the house in some safe place god can guide his hand to it if he will otherwise let us lea ve it be that was the course resolv ed on in the end it was also decided that they should not attempt to repeat the night escape which had already taken place they were to set forth openly in daylight but separ ately and on three several pretexts mistress grena was to go on professed visit to christabel old osmund escorting her but instead of returning home afterw ards she was to go forward to seven roods and there await the arrival of mr roberts he was to proceed to his works at cranbrook he usually did on tuesda y and when the time came to return home to supper was to go to seven roods and rejoin grena to all well by emily sarah holt https her own request was allotted the hardest and most perilous post of remain quietly at home after her father and aunt had departe d engaged in her usual occupations until aftern oon when she was to go out if walk accompanied by the great jack and meet her party little beyond seven roods thence they were to journey to maidstone and rochester whence they could take ship to the north jack in his character of an attached and incorruptible protector was to go with them he would be quite ready in the interests of his friends to bite priest layman and would show his teeth at the sheriff with little compunction at street moreo ver like all of his race jack was forgiving person many time had gertrude teased and tormented him her own amusement but nobody expected jack to remember it against her when he was summoned to protect her from possible enemies but perhaps the greatest advantag in jack s guardianship of gertrude was the fact that there had always been from time immemorial to an unconquer able aversion not always tacit especially on jack s part between him and the rev mr bastian if there was an individual in the world who might surely be relied on to object to the reverend gentleman s appear ance that individual was jack and if any person existed in whose presence mr bastian was likely to hesitate about attaching himself to gertrude s compan y that person was jack also jack never had been able to see why the priest should visit his master and had on several occasions expressed his opinion on that point with much decision and lucidit if therefore mr bastian would keep away from the house until gertrude started on her eventful walk he was not very likely to trouble her afterw ards the priest had fully intended to call at primrose croft that very afternoon to see mr roberts or if he were absent mistress grena but he preferred the gentleman being usually more manageable than the lady he meant to terrify the person whom he might see by vague hints of something which he had and which was not to be it might be mournfully necessary him to report to the authorities if more humilit y and subordination to his orders were not shown but he was detained first by brother priest who wished to consult him in difficult y then by the cardinal s sumner who brought documents from his eminence and lastly by beggar requesting alms having at length freed himself from these interruptions he set out primrose croft he had passed through the gates and was approaching the door when he saw an unwelcome sight which brought him to sudden stop that sight was long feathery tail waving above clump of ferns to the left was it possible that the monster was loose the gate was between mr bastian and that tail in an infinitesimal space of time ignor ant of the presence of the enem y the wind being in the wrong direction jack finished at leisure his inspection of the ferns and bounded after gertrude how exceedingly annoying said mr bastian to himself if that black demon had been out of the way and safely chained up he ought to have been i could have learned from the girl whether she had overheard anything i am sure it was her hood that i saw disappearin g behind the laurels how very provoking it must be satan that sent the creature this way at this moment howev er she will come to shrift of course on sunda y and then i shall get to know so saying mr bastian turned round and went home gertrude sauntered leisurely through the garden went out by the which jack preferred to clear at bound and walked rather slowly up the road followed by her sable escort she was afraid of seeming in haste until she was well out of the immediate neighbourhood the clouds were so far threatening that she felt it safe to carry her very necessary travelling companion in days when there were all well by emily sarah holt https she had stitched sundry gold coins and some jewellery into her underclothing but she could bring away nothing else john banks passed her on the road with mutual recognition two tramps surveyed her covetously but ventured on nearer approach when jack remarked if you the old priest of cranbrook riding quiet kindly old man whom jack entertained lessed her in response to her reverence two nuns with inscrutable white marble faces took apparent notice of her woman with basket on her arm stopped her to ask the way to frittenden passing them all she turned away from the road just before reaching staplehurst and took the field pathway which led past seven roods here jack showed much uneasiness evidently being aware that some friend of his had taken that way before them and he decidedly disappro ved of gertrude s turning aside without going up to the house the path now led through several fields and across brook spanned by little rustic bridge to the stile where it diverged into the high road from cranbrook to maidstone they reached the last field they sa w tabitha hall coming to meet them glad to see you mistress gertrude all goes well the master and mistress grena s somewhat beyond going at foot s pace and looking out you so you won way easy did y i reck oned y would oh y easy enough said gertrude but she never knew how near she had been to that which would have made it almost if not wholly impossible but how shall i ride i marvel she asked i can scarce sit on my father s saddle behind him oh look you we have pillion old mistress hall was wont to ride on so tom took and strapped it on at back of master s saddle said tabitha with that elabor ate carelessness that people assume when they know they have done kindness but want to mak it appear small possible i am truly beholden to you mistress hall but i must not linger so i can only pray god be wi you said gertru using the phrase which has now become stereot yped into but mistress gertrude won t you step up to the house and take snack ere you go further the fresh butter s but now churned and eggs new i thank you much mistress hall but i must not tarry now may god of his mercy keep y and all y ours safe and gertrude calling jack who was deeply interested in hastened on to the maidstone r oad there s somewhat come over mistress

thinking on there set it down in the chimney to keep warm it ll not take so long all well by emily sarah holt https then well i trust they ll win away all safe but i d lief not be in their shoon faint sound came from the outside jack had spied his friends and was expressing his supreme delight at having succeeded in once more piecing together the scattered fr agments of his treasure chapter thirty puzzled old margery danby the housek eeper at primrose croft was more thoroughly trustworth y than mr roberts had supposed not only in which he gave her full credit in capacit y which he had doubted born in the first year of henry the seventh margery had heard stirring tales in her childhood from parents who had lived through the wars of the roses and she too well remembered kett s rebellion and the enclosure riots in king edward s days not to know that speech is silvern but silence is golden the quiet observ ant old woman knew perfectly well that something was in the it was not her master s wont to look back and say farewell margery before he mounted his horse on tuesda y morning his weekly visit to the works and it was still less usual gertrude to remark good margery before she went out walk with jack mistress grena too had called her into her own room the night before and told her she had thought some time of making her little present recognition of her long care and fidelit y and had given her two older name margery silently put two and two together and the result was to convince her that something was about to happen nor did she suffer from any serious doubts to what it was she superintended the prepa ration of supper on that eventful day with settled conviction that nobody would be at home to eat it and when the hours passed away and nobody returned the excitement of cicely the chamber and dick the y was not in the least shared by her moreo ver she had seen with some amusement mr bastian s approach and subsequent retreat and she expected to see him again ere long when the bell rang the next morning about eight clock margery went to answer it herself and found herself confronting the gentleman she had anticipated christ save all here said the priest in reply to margery s reverential curtsey is your master within good woman father an t like he is not wont to go forth thus early mistress grena sir nor mistress gertrude neither the priest lifted his ey ebrows all hence whither be they gone an it please y sir i know not that is str ange w ent they together sir separ said they nought touching their absence all well by emily sarah holt https not to f have you fantasy at all whither they went i took it sir that my master went to the works he is wont of tuesda y and i thought mistress grena was some friend touching mistress gertrude i can sa y nought she went not forth alone surely she took jack withal sir else the conviction was slowly growing in mr bastian s mind that the wave of that feathery tail had depriv ed him of the only means of communication which he was ever likely to have with gertrud roberts the sly minx he said to himself then aloud to margery i take you rightly that all they departed yesterda y and have not yet returned that is sooth f margery stood holding the door with calm stolid face which looked if an earthquak would neither aston ish nor excite her mr bastian took another arrow from his quiv er one which he gener ally found to consider able ex ecution woman he said sternly you know more than y ha ve told father with all rev erence i know more than y her ey es met his with appear ance of insincerit y send osmund to he said walking into the house and laying down his hat and stick on the settle in the hall sir under y our good pleasure osmund went with mistress and turned not again he hath not come back here sir then they have taken flight cried the priest in passion margery danby you fear the judgment of the church and value her favour i bid you tell whither they are gone sir even holy church s favour i can not sa y that which i know not on y our soul s salv ation y not know it he said solemnly on m y soul s salv ation sir i know it not the priest strode up and down the hall more than once then he came and faced margery who w now standing beside the wide fireplace in the hall have you an y guess whither y our master ma y be gone or the gentlewomen i ve guessed many things since sir answered margery quietly but which is right and which is wrong i can t all well by emily sarah holt https when mistress collen wood and mistress pandor went hence secretly in the time knew y thereof beforehand surely had y an y ado with their departing the first thing i knew or guessed thereof father was the next morrow when i came into the hall and sa w them not mr bastian felt baffled on every side that his prey had eluded him just in time to escape the trap he meant to lay them was manifest what his next step was to be w not equally clear well he said at last with disappointed air if you know nought tis plain you can tell nought i must y to find some that can i have told you all i know father was the calm answer but margery did not say that she had told all she thought nor that if she had known more she would have revealed it mr bastian took up his hat and stick pausing moment at the door to ask is that black beast come back jack is not returned sir answered the housek eeper it was with mingled sense of relief and uneasiness on that point that the priest took the road through the village that jack was out of the way was delicious relief but suppose jack should spring suddenly on him out of some hedge or on turning corner out of the w ay might turn out to be all the more surely in it undisturbed howev er by any vision of black face and feathery tail mr bastian reached roger hall s door nell opened it and unwillingly admitted that her master was at home mr bastian being so early that roger had not yet left his house the works roger receiv ed him in his little parlour to which christie had not yet been carried hall are y aware of y our master s flight roger hall opened his ey es in genuine amaz ement sir is he gone then he nev er returned home after lea ving the works y esterda roger s face expressed nothing but honest concern his master s welfare he left the works scarce past three of the clock said he and took the road toward primrose croft god gr ant none ill hath befallen him nought the sort said the priest bluntly the gentlewomen be gone belike and osmund with them tis conce rted plan not doubt thereof and smelleth of the fire implies heretical opinions or i mistak greatly knew you nought thereof have care how y mak answer father you have right well amaz ed but to hear it most surely i knew nought saving only that when i returne d home yestre en my little maid told all well by emily sarah holt https had been so good to visit her and had brought her cake and posy of flowers from the garden but if osmund were with her or that did i not hear was mistress grena wont to visit y our daughter by times f ather not v ery often all his neighbours must be aware of mistress grena s visit roger thought it the wisest plan to be perfectly fr ank on that point ask at christabel if she wist whether osmund came withal roger made the inquiry and returned with the information that christabel did not know from her couch she could only see the horse s ears and had not noticed who w with it tis strange matter said the priest severely that gentleman of means and station with his sister and daughter and servant could disappear thus utterly and none know thereof it is f ather in very deed replied r oger sympathisingly i pray you hall make full inquiry at the works and give to wit if aught be known thereof remember you are somewhat under cloud from your near kinship to alice benden and diligence in this matter may you good turn with holy church sir i will make inquiry at the works was the answer which did not convey roger s intention to make use of the inquiries that could damage his master nor his settled con viction that information w to be had the only person at all likely to know more than himself was the cashier at the works since he lived between cranbrook and primrose croft and roger carefully timed his inquiries so not to include him the result was what he one could tell him anything he quickly and diligently communicated this interesting fact to the priest s servant his master not being at home and mr bastian was more puzzled than ever the nine days wonder gradually died down on the thursda y evening mr justice roberts came home and was met by the news of his brother s disappear ance with his family he was so astonished that he sat knife and spoon in hand while his favourite dish of broiled fowl grew cold until he had heard all that martha had to tell him supper was sooner ver than off he set to primrose croft well madge old woman said he to the old housek eeper who had once been his nurse this is strange matter surely is all true that martha tells be all they gone and none wist how nor whither come in and sit you down by the fire master anthon y said margery in whose heart was very soft spot her sometime nursling and i ll tell you all i know here s the master s keys they ll maybe be safer in your hands than mine he didn t leave wi but i went round the house and picked all up and locked everything away from them prying maids and that young jackanapes of dickon some he must ha took with him but he s left the key of the old press look y and that label hanging from it the justice looked at the label and saw his own name written in his brother s all well by emily sarah holt https ha maybe he would have open the press and search somewhat let us go to his closet madge thou canst tell the rest there while i see what this meaneth there s scarce any rest to tell mr anthon y only they are all and mistress grena and mistress gertrude and osmund and bay philbert and the black mare and old jack what jack gone belike dear heart alive why madge that hath little look of coming again it hasn t mr anthon y and one of mistress gertrude s boxes that she keeps her gems in lieth open and empt y in her chamber the justice whistled softly he fitted the k ey in the lock chapter thirty one how he heard it why what s this mr justice roberts had opened the old press tried all the drawers and come at last to the secret drawer of whose existence only he and his brother knew sooner had he applied his hand to secret spring than out darted the drawer showing that it held long document and letter addressed to himself he opened and read the latter margery standing quietly at little distance slowly and thoughtful ly when he had finished the letter he folded it up pocketed it and turned to margery ay madge he said they are gone and not coming back master anthon y not well not at this present madge my brother would have come hither and take up mine abode while look you and methinks i shall so well mr anthon y and i shall be full fain i ve been right trembling in my shoes this three days lest them noisome pests should think to come and take out all master s papers and count

that noisome pests wh y whom signif y you madge oh catchpolls and thirdboroughs minor constables and sheriffs and hangmen and turneys and the like they replied margery not very lucidly they be pests the lot of ever i see they re ill plumbers and painters and rats and get in and there s turning of out i can not abide mr justice roberts laughed come madge you may well add justices of peace you ve got pretty nigh all else prithee look to thy tongue old woman all well by emily sarah holt https shalt find thee indicted an ill subject unto the queen why they be her gracious servants grace s was then frequently spelt gracious and her bidding thou wouldst not rebel against the queen s majest y i am true woman to the queen s grace liveth mr anthon y but them folks isn t the queen nor the king neither and they be cantank erous toads every one of ever jumped in brook you haste and come there s good lad you alway was when you used to toddle about the house holding by my gown it ll seem lik old times to ha ve you back well i can come at once said the justice with smile at margery s reminiscences my brother hath left power of attorney to deal with his lands and goods and he is my landlord i have but to agree with myself over the lea ving of mine house but i shall bring martha i trust y ll not quarrel fear that mr anthon martha she s one of the quiet uns neither makes nor meddles and i

down lik couple pigeons good then i ll be hither in day or twain and if any of your pests come meantime y shak my stick at them madge and tell them i m at hand fear i ll see to that was the heart y answer so the justice took up his abode at primrose croft and the cantank erous toads did not venture near mr roberts had requested his brother to hold the estate him or in the event of his death gertrude until they should return which of course meant and was quite understood to mean until the death of the queen should make way the accession of the protestant prince ss elizabeth plain speech was often dangerous in those days and people gener ally had recourse to some vague form of words which might mean either one thing or another the justice went down to the works on the following tuesda y and called roger hall into the priv ate room read those hall an it like you he said laying before him mr roberts letter and the power of attorney roger only glanced at them and then look ed up with smile i looked something of this kind mr justice he said when master left the works on tuesda y evening he said to if my brother come hall you will see his orders looked and i reckoned it meant somewhat more than an order grey cloth we will hold ourselv es at your commands mr justice and i trust you shall find us to y our satisfaction doubt hall doubt replied the justice shut that further

to it what he might have said would rather have tis sore pity folks can not let others alone to believ they like and not trouble them that afternoon the lord bishop of dover held his court in

scarcely walk fishcock mrs final emmet wilson and sens bradbridge the last time they were asked if they would recant the same answer came from by the gr ace of god we will not then the awful sentence was be handed over to the secular state which the church prayed to punish these malefactors according to their merits by peculiarly base and hypocritical fiction it was made to appear that the church never put any heretic to only handed them over to the state with touching request that they might be gently handled what that gentle handling meant every man knew if the state had treated convicted heretic to any penalt y less than death it would soon have been found out what the church understood b y gentle handling then the second sentence that of the state was read by the sheriff on saturda y the nineteenth of june the condemned criminals were to be taken to the field beyond the dane john and in the hollow at the end thereof to be burned at the stake till they were dead the safety of the

he decided not to so there could be farewells he knew save at the stake itself and it would spare them terrible pain not to be present one person howev er he rather wished would be present it might

the hollow at the end of which the seven stakes were set up the field is nearly covered now by the station of the london chatham and dover railway but the hollow can still be traced whence the souls of his faithful witnesses went up to god john banks was early on the ground and so secured front place the crowd grew apace until half the field was covered not only residents of the city but casual made up the bulk of it the rather since it was somewhat dangerous to be absent especially suspected person from the neighbouring villages too many came village squire and his dame in rustling silks the parish priest in his cassock the labourers and their wiv es in holida y garb then the castle gates opened and the wincheap gate and forth from them came slow solemn procession preceded by crucifer bearing silver cross long array of priests and then the lord bishop of dover in his episcopal robes followed by two scarlet ed acolytes swinging thuribles from which ascended cloud of incense between his lordship s sacred person and the wicked heretics who were to follow two and two they came john fishcock the butcher led like one of his own sheep to the slaughter and nicholas white the ironmonger nicholas pardue and sens bradbridge mrs final and emmet wilson after all the rest came alice benden on the last painful journey that she should ever take she would mount next upon wings an eagle and there should her be more pain the martyrs recognised their friend john banks and each greeted him by smile then they took off their outer which were the perquisites of the and stood arrayed every one in that white robe of martyrdom of which so many were worn in mary s reign long plain garme nt falling from all well by emily sarah holt https to the feet with long loose sleeves buttoned at the

that it w some time since she had seen him ah mistress hall i could wish i had been before i came to bring you such tidings i bring tabitha looked up in his face instantly dropped the mop in her hand and came over to where he stood tis more than may be she said significantly and i reckon tis more than must john banks is it done it is done he replied the lord god hath wiped way all tears from her ey all well by emily sarah holt https the lord look upon it and avenge her was the answer in tabitha s sternest and most solemn voice the lord requite it on the head of edward benden and on the head of richard thornton wherefore doth he not rend the heavens and come down and suddenly before tabitha broke down and cried her heart out banks had nev er imagined t abitha hall could banks did not attempt to repro ve her it was useless he only said quietly forgive to leave you thus but i must be on my way my tiding s must yet be told six times and there be some hearts will break to hear them i ll spare you one said tabitha well she could speak you may let be roger hall i ll tell him banks drew long breath could he trust this strange satirical yet woman to tell those tidings in that house of all others and the white lace which the gaoler knowing him to be staplehurst man had entrusted to him to give could he lea ve it with her nay not so i pray you and thank you mistress i have an especial message and token master hall but if you would of your goodness let mistress final s childre know thereof that should an easement the white hart is most out of my so be it jack and god speed thee turning away from seven roods banks did his terrible errand to the six houses it was easiest at fishcock s where the relativ es were somewhat more distant than at the rest but hard to tell nicholas white s wife that she was widow hard to tell emmet wilson s husband that he had more wife specially hard at collet pardue s cottage where the news meant not only sorrow but worldly ruin so far mortal eye might see then he turned off to briton s mead and told mary whose tears flowed fast will y speak to him she said in an wed tone said banks almost sternly at the least doth he scarce eats morsel and his bed s all awry in the morning if he d done nought but toss about all the night i think he sleeps none or very nigh i never speak to him without he first doth and that s might y seldom banks hesitated moment then he went forward and opened the door of the mr benden he said the room was in having light but that of the moon and banks could see only just enough to assure him that something human sat in the large chair at the further end but sound answered his appeal i am but now arriv ed from canterbury still answer came john banks went on in soft hushed in his own words

silence w unbrok en one word more the lord have mercy on thy soul thou miser able sinner then banks shut the door softly and went way there we leave edward benden with the black silence of oblivion over his future life whether the holy spirit of god ever took the stony heart out of him and gave him heart of flesh god alone knows this in its main features is true story and there is word to tell us what became of the husband and betrayer of alice benden john banks went on to the last house he had to little house by the second acre close roger hall opened the door himself banks stepped in and the light of the hall lantern fell upon his face roger uttered an exclamation of pain and fear jack th y hath my face spoken to you master hall afore my tongue could frame so to perchance it is best so hold y our hand roger obeyed mechanically and banks laid on the hand held forth the long white lace you he said his voice broken by emotion john banks nerves were pretty well worn out by that day s work well they might be she gave it at the last she bade say it was the last bond she was bound cept that chain thank god were the first words that broke from the brother who loved alice so dearly the christian spoke them but the next moment the man came uppermost and an ex ceeding bitter cry of alice alice followed the thanksgiving of faith it is ver said banks in husky v oice she shall nev er see evil an y more but he knew well that he could give comfort to that strick en heart quietly and quickly he laid down the new shilling with its message the poor old father and then without another even saying he went out and closed the door behind him only god could speak comfort to roger and christabel in that dark hour only god could help poor roger to tell christie that she would never see her dear aunt alice any more until she should clasp hands with her on the street of the golden city and under the shade of the tree of life and god would help him john banks was quite sure of that but he stepped out into the summer night it seemed almost if he could see if the outward circumstances in which he had beheld the trio were prophetic in the glory of the great light roger with his way shown clearly by the little lamp of god s word and edward in that black shadow made lurid and more awful by the faint unearthly light the moon came out brightly from behind cloud just banks lifted his ey es

post of architect of new church tis your doing said the architect he wrung the hard hand of the mason you made man of by your teaching and praying and never despairing that i should one y be worth the

cross and say it little so i can conceiv the same what manner of cross sweet heart you know what our lord saith father he that taketh not his cross and followeth is not worth y of i ve been thinking deal on it of late i wouldn t like not to be worth y of him but i can t take my cross till i know what it is i asked cousin friswith and she said it meant doing all manner of hard disagreeable things like the monks and nuns dry bread and sleeping of board and such like but when i talked with pen pardue she said she reckoned it signified not that at all that was making crosses and our lord did not mention that so please f ather what is it methinks my child pen hath the right take is not we be to take the cross god layeth on our backs he makes the crosses we have but to take them and bear them folks make terrible messes by times when they essay to make their own crosses but thou wouldest know what is cross well all well by emily sarah holt https anything that cometh across thee and makes thee cross none wist so well th yself what so doth but f ather said christie in tone of alarm well sweet heart there must be such lot of them some folks christie methinks the lord carveth out one

meditation i must have the little handful but then must i carry them all at once one at once little one which thy father giveth thee let him choose which and how and when by times he may give thee more than one but methinks mostly tis one at once though they may change oft and swiftly take thy cross and follow the lord jesus there s banging doors pursued christie with the same thoughtful air

aunt tabitha and cousin friswith certainly must be crosses she mentally decided and uncle edward must have been dear aunt alice s cross and dreadful one then she came back to the point in hand how must i take up my cross father doth it mean i must not grumble at it and feel if i w anted to get rid of it fast ev er i could roger smiled and sighed that is hard work christie is it not but it would be cross if it were not hard and heavy thou canst not but feel that it will be glad thing to lay it down but now while god layeth it on thee be willing to bear it his sake he giveth it thy sake that thou mayest be made partak er of his holiness be thou ready to carry it his the cup which my father hath given shall i not drink it there ll be crosses and cups in hea ven will there f ather not one

verses were you thinking perhaps you d miss if i went soon poor father but maybe i sha n t look you tis only when i ache so and feel all over strings sometimes i but we don t know father we and we

letting peaceable folks be if they reckon piece of bread to be piece of bread i d nev er burn them it by this reflection it will be seen that mr justice roberts in his heart was neither papist nor protestant but gallio whose convictions were pliable when w anted so to be i marvel how soon i shall hear of tom the justice s meditations went on i can not let him know anything i don t know where he is i rather guess at shardeford with his wife s folks but i had care not to find out he ll hear fast enough that it is safe to come home i shouldn t wonder the justice wheeled round suddenly and spoke aloud this time saints alive what s that nothing either audible or visible appeared moment what was that black thing said the justice to himself he was answered suddenly in loud tones of great gr atification bow bow all well by emily sarah holt https whatev er said the justice to the black thing which was careering about him apparently on every side of him at once leaping into the air high his head trying to lick his face wagging not only feathery tail but whole body laughing all over delighted face and gener ally behaving itself in rapturously ecstatic manner art thou rejoicing queen elizabeth too and whose dog art thou didst i think it i verily believ tis old jack himself of course it is said jack s eyes and tail and every bit of jack executing fresh caper of intense satisfaction why then they must be come exclaimed the justice and set off the front door pursued by jack it is needless to say that jack won the race by consider able lengths oh here s uncle anthon y cried pandor

finished and jack assisted at all in turn but when the first welcomes were over and the travellers had changed their dress and they sat down to supper hastily got up by margery s willing hands there was opportunit y to exchange real information on both sides and where have you been now all this while asked the justice i never knew and rather wished not to guess at shardeford the first part then

kept the works if you had been there ev ery he saith not much but he can with the best ay he was ever trustworth y servant answered mr roberts tis marvel to though that he w nev er arrest that can not

to show your sense of hall s diligence and probit that will i if god permit but there is another to whom i owe thanks anthon y and that is y ourself to ha ve saved my lands and goods well tom answered
