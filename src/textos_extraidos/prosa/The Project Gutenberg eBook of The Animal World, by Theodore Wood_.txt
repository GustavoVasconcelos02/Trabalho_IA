introduction this volume is sketch of the animal life of the whole world more than sketch it could not be in the space at the author command but he has so skilfully selected his examples to illustrate both the natural groups and the faunas which they represent that his work forms most commendable the study of natural history few writers have been so successful in handling this subject his style is singularly attractive to the young readers whom he has in view yet he does not depart from accuracy nor exaggerate with false emphasis some unusual phase of an animal character which is the fault of many who try to popularize zoölogy one may feel conﬁdent therefore that the boy or girl who opens this volume will enjoy it and proﬁt by it the sketch dwells on the animals most often to be seen in nature or in menageries or read of in books of travel and adventure and will thus serve valuable reference aid in such reading but it will and ought to more it will arouse anew that interest in the creatures about us which is natural breath to every youngster but is too rarely fostered by parents and teachers nothing is more valuable in the foundation of an education than the faculty and habit of power of noting understandingly or at least inquiringly what happens within our sight and hearing to go about with one eyes half shut content to see the curtain and never curious to look at the play on nature stage behind it is to miss very large part of the possible pleasur in life that his child should not suffer this loss ought to be the concern of every parent little more than encouragement and some opportunity is needed to preserve and cultivate this disposition and faculty direct youngster attention to some common fact of woodland life new to him and his interest and imagination will be excited to learn more give him hint of the relationshi p of this fact to other facts and you have started him on scientiﬁc search and he has begun to train his eye and his mind without knowing it at this point such books this are extremely helpful and lead to desire the more special treatises which happily are now everywhere accessible this suggestion is not made with the idea that every youngster is to become ﬂedged naturalist but with the sense that some knowledge of nature will be source of delight throughout life and with the certainty that in direction can quickness of eye and accuracy of sight and reasoning be so well and easily acquired these are qualities which make success in all lines of human activity and therefore are to be regarded among the most important to be acquired early in life xi xii the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https physical beneﬁt of an interest in animal life which leads to outdoor exercise needs argument the mental value has been touched upon the moral importance is in the sense of truth which nature inculcates and the kindliness sure to follow the affectionate interest with which the young naturalist must regard all living things matter what is to be their walk in life the observing study of nature should be regarded the corner of boy or girl education ernest i ngersoll mammals chapter i apes and gibbons first among the mammals come the monkeys first among the monkeys come the apes and ﬁrst among the apes come the chimpanzees almost the lar gest of all monkeys chimp anzees when it is fully grown male chimpanz ee stands nearly ﬁve feet high and it would be even taller still if only it could stand upright but that is thing which monkey can ever because instead of having feet we have which can be planted ﬂat upon the ground these animals only have hind hands there is real sole to them instep and heel while the great toe is ever so much more like huge thumb the consequence is that when monkey tries to stand upright he can only rest upon the outside edges of these feet while his knees have to be bent awkwardly outward so he looks at least three inches shorter than he really is and he can only hobble along in very clumsy and ungraceful manner but then on the other hand he is far better able to climb about in the trees than we are because while we are only able to place our feet ﬂat upon branch so to stand upon it he can grasp the branches with all four hands and obtain very much ﬁrmer hold chimpanzees are found in the great forests of central and western africa where they feed upon the wild fruits which grow there so abundantly they spend almost the whole of their lives among the trees and have curious way of making nests their families to live in by twisting the smaller branches of the trees together so to form small platform the mother and her little ones occupy this nest while the father generally sleeps on bough just underneath it sometime quite number of these nests may be seen close together the chimpanzees having built kind of village themselves in the midst of the forest c lever s pecimen if you visit the zoölogical gardens in new york london or some other city you may be quite sure of seeing one or more chimpanzees they are nearly always brought to the zoos when they are quite young and the keepers teach them to perform all kinds of clever tricks one of them in the london zoo who was called sally and who lived there several years actually learned to count if she was asked two three four or ﬁve straws she would pick up just the right number from the bottom of her cage and 1 2 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https them to the keeper without ever making mistake generally too she would pick up six or seven straws if the keeper asked them but if eight nine or ten were asked she often became confused and could not be quite sure how many to give she was very cunning animal however and when she became tired of counting she would sometimes pick up two straws only and double them over so to make them look like four sally could talk too after fashion and used to make three different sounds one of these evidently meant yes anoth er signiﬁed and the third seemed to be intended thank you she always used it when the keeper gave her nut or banana two kinds of chimpanzees are known namely the common chimpanzee which is by far the more plentiful of the two and the bald chimpanzee which has scarcely any hair on the upper part of its head one very intelligent bald chimpanzee was kept in barnum menagerie and was even more clever in some ways than sally herself the g orilla larger even than the chimpanzee is the gorilla the biggest and strongest of all the apes which sometimes grows to height of nearly six feet it is only found in western africa close to the equator and has hardly ever been seen by white travelers since it lives in the densest and darkest parts of the great forests but several nearly all quite small been caught alive and kept in captivity in zoos where however they soon died one of these named gena lived about three weeks in the crystal palace near london she was most timid little creature and if anybody went to look at her she would hide behind chimpanzee which inhabited the same cage and watched over her in the most motherly way another who was called pongo lived rather more than two months in the london zoo and seemed more nervous still he used to become terriﬁed if even his keeper went into the cage but when the animal has grown up it is said to be most savage and formidable foe and the natives of central africa are even more afraid of it than they are of the lion like most of the great apes the gorilla has most curious way of sheltering itself during heavy shower of rain if you were to look at its arms you would notice that the hair upon them is very thick and long and that while it grows downwar d from the shoulder to the elbow from the elbow to the wrist it grows upwar so when it is caught in heavy rain the animal covers its head and shoulders with its arms then the long hair upon them acts just like thatch and carries off the water so that the gorilla hardly gets wet at all when the gorilla is upon the ground it generally walks upon all fours bending the ﬁngers of the hands inward so that it rests upon the knuckles but it is much more active in the trees and is said to be able to leap to the ground from branch twenty or thirty feet high without being hurt in the least by the fall the rang tan another very famous ape is the which is found in borneo and suma tra it is reddish brown in color and is clothed with much longer hair than either the gorilla or the chimpanzee while its face is surprisingly large and broad with very high forehead but the most curious feature of this animal is the great length of its arms when man stands upright and allows his arms to hang down by his sides the tips of his ﬁngers reach about between his hips and his knees when chimpanzee stands upright possible the tips of its ﬁnger s almost touch its knees but when an does the same its ﬁngers nearly touch the ground of course when the animal is walking it ﬁnds that these long arms are very much in its way so it generally uses them crutches resting the knuckles upon the ground and swinging its body between them but the orang seldom comes down to the ground it is far more at its ease among the branches of the trees and although it never seems to be in hurry it will swing itself 3 4 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https from bough to bough and from tree to tree quite fast man can run below like the gorilla and the chimpanzee it makes rough nests of twisted boughs in which the female animal and the little ones sleep and if it is mortally wounded it nearly always makes platform of branches in the same way and sits upon it waiting death orangs are often to be seen in zoölogic al gardens although they are so delicate that they not thrive well in captivity one of these animals which lived in the london zoo some time had learned very clever trick leaning up against his cage was placard on which were the words the animals in this cage must not be fed the orang very soon found out that when this notice was up nobody gave him any nuts or biscuits so he would wait until the keeper back was turned knock the placard down with the printed words underneath and then hold out his paw food general rule orangs seem far too lazy to be at all savage those in zoos nearly always lie about on the ﬂoor of their cage all day wrapped in their blankets with kind of grin upon their great broad faces but when they are roused into passion they seem to be very formidable creatures and alfred russel wallace tells us of an orang that turned upon dyak who was trying to spear it tore his arm so terribly with his teeth that he never recovered the proper use of the limb and would almost certainly have killed him if some of his companions had not come to his rescue gibbons next we come to the gibbons which are very wonderful animals they are such astonishing gymnasts most monkeys are very active in the trees but the gibbons almost seem to be ﬂying from bough to bough dashing about with such marvelous speed that the eye can scarcely follow their movemen ts travelers on seeing them the ﬁrst time have often mistaken them big blackbirds they hardly seem to swing themselves from one branch to another they just dart and dash about upward downward sideways backward often taking leaps of twenty or thirty feet through the air and yet so far one can see they only just touch the boughs they pass with the tips of their ﬁngers if you should happen to see gibbon in the next zoo that you visit be sure to ask the keeper to offer the animal grape or piece of banana and you will be more than surprised at its marvelous activity the arms of the gibbons are very not quite so long those of the that when these animals stand upright they can the tips of their ﬁngers nearly touch the ground but they not use these limbs crutches the orang does instead of that they either clasp their hands behind the neck while they are walking or else stretch out the arms on either side with the elbows bent downward to help them in keeping their balance so that when gibbon leaves the trees and takes short stroll upon the ground below it looks rather like big letter w suspended on forked pole 5 6 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of apes and monkeys diana monkey hanuman monkey mandrill baboon capuchin monkey spider monkey gibbons generally live together in large companies which often consist of from ﬁfty to hundred animals and they have very odd habit of sitting in the topmost branches of tall trees at sunrise and again at sunset and joining in kind of concert the leader always seems to be the animal with the strongest voice and after he has uttered peculiar barking cry perhaps half dozen times the others all begin to bark in chorus often two hours the outcry is kept up so loud that it may be heard on still day two or three miles then by degrees it dies away and the animals are almost silent until the time their next performance comes round several different kinds of gibbons are known the largest of which is the siamang this animal is found only in sumatra it is little over three feet high when fully grown if you ever see it at zoo you may know it at once by its glassy black color and its odd whitish beard then there is the hoolock which is common in many parts of india and has white band across its eyebrows while the lar gibbon of the malay peninsula has broad ring of white all round its face besides these there are one or two others but they are all so much alike in their habits that there is need to mention them separately chapter ii baboons how can we tell baboon from an ape that is quite easy just glance at his face you will notice at once that he has long broad muzzle like that of dog with the nostrils at the very tip this reason the baboons are sometimes known monkeys then look at his limbs you will 7 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https directly that his arms are longer than his legs that is because he does not live in the trees the apes he lives in rough rocky places on the sides of mountains where there are trees at all so that arms like those of the gibbons or the would be of use to him he does not want to climb he wants to be able to scamper over the rocks and to run swiftly up steep cliffs where there is only just room enough to gain footing so his limbs are made in such way that he can go on all fours like dog and gallop along so fast among the stones and boulders that it is hard to overtake him the c hacma perhaps the best known of the baboons is the chacma which is found in south africa the animal is so big and strong and so very savage that if he is put into large cage in company with other monkeys he always has to be secured in corner by stout chain chacma that lived some years in the crystal palace was fastened up in this way and the smaller monkeys who knew exactly how far his chain would allow him to go would sit about two inches out of his reach and eat their nuts in front of him this used to make the chacma furious and after chattering and scolding away some time if telling his tormentors what dreadful things he would to them if ever he got the chance he would snatch up an armful of straw from the bottom of his cage and ﬂing it at them with both hands if i fed the smaller monkeys with nuts instead of giving them to him says visitor he would ﬂing the straw at chacmas live in large bands among the south african mountains and are very difﬁcult to watch they always post two or three of their number sentinels soon any sign of danger appears one of the watchers gives short sharp bark all the rest of the band understand the signal and scamper away fast they can sometimes however the animals will hold their ground hunter was once riding over mountain ridge when he came upon band of chacmas sitting upon rock thinking that they would at once run away he rode at them but they did not move and when he came little closer they looked so threatening that he thought it wiser to turn back again an angry chacma is very formidable foe it is nearly big mastif f and ever so much stronger while its great teeth cut like razors when one of these animals is hunted with dogs it will often gallop along until one of its pursuers has outstripped the rest and will then suddenly turn and spring upon him plunge its teeth into his neck and while its jaws are still clenched thrust the body of its victim away the result is that the throat of the poor dog is torn completely open and moment later its body is lying bleeding on the ground while the chacma is galloping on before these baboons are very mischievous creatures they come down from their mountain retreats by night in order to plunder the orchards and so cautiously is the theft carried out that even the dogs on guard know nothing of what is going on and the animals nearly always succeed in getting away when it can not obtain fruit the chacma feeds chieﬂy upon the bulb of kind of iris which it digs out of the ground with its paw and then carefully peels but it is also fond of insects and may often be seen turning over stones and catching the beetles which were lying hidden beneath them it will even eat scorpions but is careful to pull off their stings before doing so the m andrill another interesting baboon is the mandrill which one does not often see in captivity it comes from western africa while it is young there is little that is remarkable about it but the male is animal on each of its cheeks there is swelling big large sausage which runs upward from just above the nostrils to just below the eyes these swellings are light blue and have number of grooves running down them which are colored rich purple while the line between them well the tip of the nose is bright scarlet the face is very large in proportion to the size of the 8 9 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https and the forehead is topped by pointed crest of upright black hair while under the chin is beard of orange yellow on the hind quarters are two large bare patches of the same brilliant scarlet the nose so you see that altogether male mandrill is very creature the female mandrill has much smaller swellings on her face they are dull blue in color without any lines of either purple or scarlet almost all monkeys are subject at times to terrible ﬁts of passion but the mandrill seems to be the worst tempered of all fancy an animal dying simply from rage it sounds impossible yet the mandrill has been known to so and the natives of the countries in which it lives are quite much afraid of it they are of lion yet it has once or twice been tamed in the natural history museum at south kensington london is the skin of mandrill which lived some years in that city in the earlier part of the nineteenth century his name was jerry and he was so quiet and contented that he was generally known happy jerry he learned to smoke pipe he was very fond of glass of beer he even used to sit at table his meals and to eat from plate by means of knife and fork and he became so famous that he was actually taken down to windsor to appear before king geor ge the fourth there is another baboon called the drill which is not unlike the mandrill in many respects but the swellings on its face are not nearly large and they remain black all through its life it is much smaller animal too and looks on the whole very much like mandrill while it is quite young the g elada almost the mandrill though in quite different way is the gelada which is found in abyssinia perhaps we may compare it to black poodle with very long and thick mane upon its neck and shoulders when the animal sits upright this mane entirely covers the upper part of its shoulders so that gelada looks very much if it were wearing coachman mantle of long fur in some parts of abyssinia geladas are very numerous living among the mountains in bands of two or three hundred like the chacmas in south africa they are very mischievous in the orchards and plantations always making their raids by night it is said that on one occasion they actually stopped less personage than duke of cobur and prevented him from proceeding on his journey several hours the story is that the duke was traveling in abyssinia his road lay through narrow pass overhung with rocky cliffs that one of his attendants catching sight of number of geladas upon the rocks above ﬁred at them that the angry baboon s at once began to roll down great stones upon the path below and that before they could be driven off they succeeded in completely blocking the road so that the duke carriage could not be moved until the stones had been cleared away whether this story is altogether true or not we can not say but there can be doubt that geladas are very warlike animals not only will they attack human beings who interfere with them they also attack other baboons when they are raiding an orchard instance they sometimes meet with band of arabian baboons which have come there the same purpose themselves ﬁerce battle then takes place first of all the geladas try to roll down stones upon their rivals then they rush down and attack them with the utmost fury and very soon the orchard is ﬁlled with maddened baboons tumbling and rolling over one another biting and tearing and scratching each other and shrieking with furious rage the arabian baboon itself is very interesting creature it is one of the animals which were venerated by the ancient egyptians they considered it sacred to their god thoth and treated it with the greatest possible honor and when it died they made its body into mummy and buried it in the tombs of the kings sometimes too they made use of the animal while it lived they would train it to climb pluck the ripe ﬁgs and hand them down to the slaves waiting below 10 11 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https baboons sometimes travel in great companies the old males always go ﬁrst and are closely followed by the females those which have little ones carrying them upon their backs they march along perhaps one of the younger animals ﬁnds bush with fruit upon it and stops to eat little soon they see what he is doing number of others rush to the spot and begin ﬁghting share but generally one of the old males hears the noise boxes all their ears and drives them away and then sits down and eats the fruit himself the p roboscis onkey next we come to group of animals called monkeys and the most curious of them all is the this is the only monkey which really possesses nose some monkeys have nostrils only and some have muzzles but the has not merely nose but very long nose so long in fact that when one of these monkeys is leaping about in the trees it is said always to keep its nose carefully covered with one hand so that it may not be injured by knock against bough strange to say it is only the male animal that has this very long nose and even he does not get it until he is grown up indeed you can tell pretty well how old male is just by glancing at his nose when he is young it is quite small he gets older it grows bigger and by the time that he reaches his full size it is three or four inches long naturally this long nose gives him very strange appearance and his great bushy whiskers which meet under his chin make him look more curious still we not know much about the habits of the in borneo its native country it lives in the thick forests and is said to be almost active among the branches of the trees the gibbons themselves the dyaks not believe that it is monkey at all but say that it is really very hairy man who insists on living in the forests in order to escape paying taxes the h anuman the hanuman another of the d monkeys lives in india where it is treated with almost much reverence the arabian baboon was in egypt in days of old the natives not exactly worship these monkeys but they think that they are sacred to the god hanuman from whom they take their name besides that they believe that these animals are not really monkeys at all but that their bodies are inhabite d by the souls of great and holy men who lived and died long ago but have now come back to earth again in different form so hindu will ever kill hanuman monkey or injure it in any way matter how much mischief it may the consequence is that these animals are terrible thieves they know perfectly well that one will try to kill them or even to trap them so they come into the villages visit the bazaars and help themselves to anything to which they may take fancy yet all that the will is to place on the roofs of their shops to prevent the monkeys from sitting there european sportsmen however often ﬁnd the hanuman very useful its greatest enemy is the tiger and when one of these animals is being hunted number of hanumans will follow it wherever it goes and point it out to the beaters by their excited chattering next to the tiger the hanuman dislikes snakes more than any living creature and when it ﬁnds one of these reptiles aslee p it will creep cautiously up to it seize it by the neck and then rub its head backward and forward upon branch till its jaws have been completely ground away the hanuman belongs to group of monkeys which are called langurs they may be known by their long and almost lanky bodies by the great length of their tails and by the fact that they not possess the which many other monkeys ﬁnd so useful and it is very curious that while the arms of the apes are longer than their legs the legs of the are almost active in the longer than their arms if you ever happen to see hanuman you may know it at once by its black face and feet and by its odd eyebrows which are very bushy and project quite away in front of its 12 13 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https the g uenons we now come to the guenons of which there are great many kinds let us take two of these examples of the rest the ﬁrst is the green monkey which comes from the great forests of western africa you may know it by sight because it is the commonest monkey in every menagerie it is one of the monkeys too which so often carry about on their organs but they not care to have it except when it is quite young although it is very gentle and playful until it reaches its full size it afterward becomes ﬁerce and sullen and is apt at any moment to break out into furious passion like most of the guenons green monkeys go about in droves each under the leadership of an old male who wins and keeps his position by ﬁghting all his rivals strange to say each of these droves seem s to have its own district allotted to it and if by any chance it should cross its boundary the band into whose territory it has trespassed will at once come and ﬁght it and their utmost to drive it back would it be interesting to know how the animals mark out their own domains and how they let one another know just how far they will be permitted to go our second example of the guenons is the diana monkey which you may at once recognize by its long pointed ite beard it seems to be very proud of this beard and while drinking holds it carefully back with one hand in order to prevent it from getting wet why is it called the diana monkey because of the curious white mark upon its forehead which is shaped like the crescent which the ancients used to think was borne by the goddess diana it is very handsome animal its back is rich chestnut brown in color and the lower part of its body is orange yellow while between the two is band of pure white its face and tail and hands and feet are black it is very gentle animal and is easily tamed the m angabeys these are very monkeys they all have white eyelids which are very conspicuous in their faces indeed they always give one kind of idea that they must spend their whole lives in sweeping chimneys they are among the most interesting of all monkeys to watch they are not only so active and full of life that they scarcely seem able to keep still but they are always twisting their bodies about into all sorts of strange attitudes when in captivity they soon ﬁnd out that visitors are amused by their antics and are always ready to go through their performances in order to obtain nut or piece of cake then they have an odd way when they are walking about their cages of lifting their upper lips and showing their teeth so that they look just if they were grinning at you and instead of carrying their tails behind them monkeys generally or holding them straight up in the air they throw them forward over the back so that the tip comes just above the head only four kinds of mangabey are known and they are all found in western africa macaques there is one more family of monkeys found in the old world which we must mention and that consists of the animals known macaques they are natives of asia with one exception and that is the famous magot the only monkey which lives wild in any part of europe it inhabits the rock of gibraltar and though it is not nearly common it used to be there is still small band of these animals with which nobody is allowed to interfere they move about the rock good deal when the weather is warm and sunny they prefer the side that faces the mediterranean but soon cold easterly wind springs up they all travel round to the western side which is much more sheltered 14 15 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https always keep to the steepest parts of the cliff and it is not easy to get near enough to watch them generally the only way to see them at all is by means of telescope the magot is sometimes known the barbary ape although of course it is not really an ape at all but it is very common in barbary and two or three times when the little band of monkeys on the rock seemed in danger of dying out few specimens have been brought over from africa just to make up the number the only other member of this family that we can mention is the macaque which is found in siam and burma it owes its name to its fondness crabs spending most of its time on the banks of creeks in order to search them but perhaps the strangest thing about it is that it is splendid swimmer and an equally good diver it has been known to jump overboard and to swim more than ﬁfty yards under water in its attempts to avoid recapture chapter iii the american monkeys and the lemurs great many very curious monkeys live in america and in several ways they are very dif ferent from those of africa and asia most of the old world monkeys example possess large in which after eating meal they can carry away nearly enough food another doubt you have often seen monkey with its cheeks perfectly stuffed out with nuts but in the american monkeys these pouches are never found then american monkey has those bare patches on its hind quarters which are present in all the monkeys of the old world with the exception of the great apes and which are often so brightly colored and more curious still american monkey has proper thumb the ﬁngers are generall y very long and strong but the thumb is either wanting altogether or else it is so small that

them gamboling among the branches of the trees the reason is that their bodies are very slightly built and their arms and legs are very long and slender while the tail is often longer than the head and body together and looks just like an extra limb and indeed it is used an extra limb it is prehensile that is it can be coiled round any small object so tightly to obtain very ﬁrm hold spider never likes to take single step without ﬁrst twisting the tip of its tail round branch so that this member really serves sort of ﬁfth hand sometimes too the animal will feed itself with its tail instead of with its paws and it can even hang from bough some little time by means of its tail alone in order to pluck fruit which would otherwise be out of its reach owing partly doubt to constant use the last few inches of this wonderful tail are quite bare any hair at all it is worth while to remember just here that while in many american monkeys the tail has this prehensile grasp monkey of the old world is provided with this convenience when spider ﬁnds itself upon level ground where its tail of course is of use to it it always seems very uncomfortable but it manages to keep its balance it walks along by holding the tail over its back and just turning it ﬁrst to one side and then to the other the need of the moment may require it uses it in fact very much an acrobat uses his pole when walking upon the tight rope it is rather curious to ﬁnd that while other monkeys are very fond of nibbling the tips of their own tails often making them quite raw spider never so they 17 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https know too well how useful those members are to injure them by giving way to such silly is even worse than biting one nails when spider is shot it sits in tree it always coils its tail round branch at once and even after it dies the body will often hang several days suspend ed by the tail alone these monkeys spend almost the whole of their lives in the trees feeding upon fruit and leaves and only coming down to the ground when they want to drink general rule they are dreadfully lazy creatures and will sit on bough hours together without moving limb but when they are playful or excited they swing themselves to and fro and dart from branch to branch almost actively the gibbons howlers very much like the spider are the howlers which are very common in the great forests of central america they owe their name to the horrible cries which they utter they move about in the trees by night you remember how the gibbons hold kind of concert in the every morning and every evening though to salute the rising and the setting sun well the howlers behave in just the same way except that their concert begins soon after dark and goes on all through the night they have very powerful voices and travelers who are not used to their noise say that it is quite impossible to sleep in the forest if there is troop of howlers anywhere within two miles and it is hard to believe that the outcry comes from the throats of monkeys at all you would suppose says famous travele r that half the wild beasts of the forest were collecting the work of carnage now it is the tremendous roar of the jaguar he springs upon his prey now it changes to his terrible and growlings he is pressed on all sides by superior force and now you hear his last dying groan beneath mortal wound one of them alone is capable of producing all these sounds and if you advance cautiously and get under the high and tufted trees where he is sitting you may have capital opportunity of witness ing his wonderful powders of produc ing these dreadful and discordant sounds if one monkey alone is capable of roaring loudly jaguar think what the noise must be when ﬁfty or sixty howlers are all howling at the same time wonder travelers ﬁnd it difﬁcult to sleep in the forest perhaps the best known of these monkeys is the red howler its color is reddish brown with broad band of golden yellow running along the spine while its face is surrounded by bushy whiskers and beard the uakari another very curious american monkey is the ouakari if you were to see it from little distance you would most likely think that it was suffering from bad attack of scarlet fever the face and upper part of the neck are bright red in color though they had been smeared with vermilion paint and its whiskers and beard are sandy yellow it is very animal if ouakari is unwell strange to say the bright color of its face begins to fade at once and very soon after death it disappears altogether ouakaris are generally caught in very singular way they are only found in very small district on the southern bank of the amazon river and spend their whol lives in the topmost branches of the tallest trees where it is quite impossible to follow them and if they were shot with gun of course they would almost certainly be killed so they are shot with blowpipe instead slender arrow is dipped into kind of poison called wourali which has been diluted to about half its usual strength and is then discharged at the animal from below only very slight wound is caused but the poison is still so strong that the ouakari soon faints and falls from its perch in the branches but the hunter who is carefully watching catches it in his arms it falls and puts little salt into its mouth this overcomes the effect of the poison and very soon the little animal is well ever 18 19 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https which are caught in this way however are generally very and the gentle and playful little animals sometimes seen in zoos have been taken when very young they are very delicate creatures and nearly always die after few weeks of conﬁnement the c ouxia if you were to see couxia or black saki it is often called the ﬁrst thing that you would say would most likely be what an extraordinary beard and your next remark would be why it looks if it were wearing wig its projecting black beard is big that of the most heavily bearded man you ever saw while on its head is great mass of long black hair neatly parted in the middle and hanging down on either side so that it looks just like wig which has been rather clumsily made the couxia is extremely proud of its beard and takes very great pains to prevent it from getting either dirty or wet you remember how the diana monkey holds its beard with one hand while drinking so to keep it from touching the water well the couxia is more careful still it will not put its lips to the water at all but carries it to its mouth very little at time in the palm of its hand but the odd thing is that it seems rather ashamed of thinking so much about its personal appearance and if it knows that anybody is looking at it will drink just like any other monkey and pretend not to care at all about wetting its beard like most of the sakis the couxia is not at all animal and is apt to give way to sudden ﬁts of fury so savagely will it bite when enraged that it has been known to drive its teeth deeply into thick board the d ouroucoulis sometimes these odd little animals are called because all day long they are fast asleep in hollow tree and soon after sunset they wake up and all night long are prowling about the branches of the trees searching roosting birds and the other small creatures upon which they feed they are very active and will often strike at moth or beetle it ﬂies by and catch it in their deft little paws and their eyes are very much like those of cats so that they can see well on dark night other monkeys can during the day the eyes too are very large if you were to look at the skull of douroucouli you would notice that the almost meet in the middle only very narrow strip of bone dividing them and the hair that surrounds them is set in circle just like the feathers that surround the eyes of an owl but perhaps the most curious fact about these animals is that sometimes they roar like jaguars and sometimes they bark like dogs and sometimes they mew like cats there are several different kinds of these little monkeys the most numerous perhaps being the douroucouli which has three upright black stripes on its forehead they are all natives of brazil and other parts of tropical america marmosets one of the the very all monkeys is the marmoset which is found in the same part of the world it is quite small animal being bigger in body than common squirrel with tail about foot long this tail which is very thick and bushy is white in color encircled with number of black rings while the body is blackish with gray markings and the face is black with white nose but what one notices more than anything else is the long tufts of hair upon the ears which make the little animal look something like negro marmosets are very easily tamed and they are so gentle in their ways and so engaging in their habits that if only they were little more hardy we should most likely see them in this country often we see pet cats but they are delicate little creatures and can not bear cold what they like to eat most of all is the black beetle of our 20 21 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https if only we could keep pet marmosets they would very soon clear our houses of cockroaches these troublesome creatures are correctly called they will spend hours in hunting the insects and whenever they catch one they pull off its legs and wings and then proceed to devour its body when marmoset is suddenly alarmed it utters an odd little whistling cry owing to this habit it is sometimes known the ouistiti or lemurs relatives of the monkeys and yet in many respects very different from them are those very strange animals the lemurs which are sometimes called the reason why that name has been given to them is this lemurs by the ancients were supposed to be ghosts which wandered about by night now most of the lemurs are never seen abroad by day their eyes can not bear the bright sunlight so all day long they sleep in hollow trees but when it is quite dark they come out prowling about the branches so silently and so stealthily that they really seem more like specters than living animals when you see them close they not look very much like monkeys their faces are much more like those of foxes and they have enormous staring eyes without any expression the true lemurs are only found in madagascar where they are so numerous that two or three at least may be found in every little copse throughout the island more than thirty different kinds are known of which however we can not mention more than two the ﬁrst of these is the lemur which may be recognized at once by the fact that its tail is marked just like that of the marmoset the head and body are shaped like those of very small fox and the color of the fur is ashy gray rather darker on the back and rather lighter underneath it lives in troops in central madagascar and every morning and every night each troop joins in little concert just like the gibbons and the howlers but oddly enough this lemur is seldom seen in the trees it lives on the ground in rough and rocky places and its hands and feet are made in such way to enable it to cling ﬁrmly to the wet and slippery boulders in fact they are not at all unlike the feet of the body is clothed with long fur and when mother lemur carries her little one about on her back it burrows down so deep into her thick coat that one can scarcely see it at all the ruffed lemur is the largest of these curious animals being about big sized cat the oddest thing about it is that it varies so very much in color sometimes it is white all over sometimes it is partly white and partly black and sometimes it is reddish brown generally however the shoulders and front legs the middle of the back and the tail are black or very dark brown while the rest of the body is white and there is great thick ruf f of white hairs all round the face the eyes of this lemur are very singular you know of course how the pupil of cat eye becomes narrower and narrower in strong light until at last it looks merely like an upright slit in the eyeball well that of the lemur is made in very much the same way except that the pupil closes up from above and below instead of from the sides so that the slit runs across the eyeball and not up and down the slender loris may be described lemur without tail it is found in the forests of southern india and ceylon it is quite small the head and body being only about eight inches long and in general appearance it gives one rather the idea of bat without any wings in color it is dark gray with narrow white stripe between the eyes this animal has very queer way of going to sleep it sits on bough and rolls itself up into ball with its head tucked away between its thighs while its hands are tightly folded round branch springing up from the one on which it is seated in this attitude it spends the whole of the day at night it hunts sleeping birds moving so slowly and silently among the branches never to give the alarm and always plucking off their feathers before it proceeds to eat them strange to say while many monkeys have thumbs the slender loris has foreﬁngers while the great toes on its feet are very long and are directed backward instead of forward 22 23 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https there are two lemur animals which are so extraordinary that each of them has been put into family all by itself the ﬁrst of these is the tarsier which is found in several of the larger islands in the malay archipelago imagine an animal about big small rat with long tail covered thickly with hair at the root and the tip the middle part being smooth and bare the eyes are perfectly round and are so big that they seem to occupy almost the whole of the staring eyes with very small pupils the ears are very long and pointed and stand almost straight up from the head then the hind legs are so long that they remind one of those of kangaroo while all the ﬁngers and all the toes have large round pads under the tips which seem to be used suckers and to have wonderful power of grasp altogether the tarsier scarcely looks like an animal at all it looks like goblin this singular creature seldom seems to walk it hops along the branches instead just kangaroo hops on the ground and when it wants to feed it sits upright on its hind quarters and uses its fore paws just squirrel does even more curious still is the of madagascar which has puzzled naturalists very much its incisor sharp cutting teeth that is in the middle of each jaw formed just like those of the rat and the rabbit they are made not cutting but gnawing and fast they are worn away from above they grow from beneath all of its ﬁngers are long and slender but the middle one is longer than all the rest and is so thin that it looks like nothing but skin and bone most likely this ﬁnger which has sharp little claw at the tip is used in hooking out insects from their burrows in the bark of trees but the does not feed only upon insects it often does some damage in the sugar plantations ripping up the canes with its sharp front teeth in order to get at the sweet juices it is said at times to catch small birds either the purpose of eating them or else to drink their blood and it seems also to eat fruit while in captivity it thrives on boiled rice the is about big rather small cat and its great bushy tail is longer than its head and body put together it is not common animal even in madagascar and its name of is said to have been given to it on account of the exclamations of surprise uttered by the natives when it was shown to them the ﬁrst time by european traveler but it is more likely that the name comes from the cry of the animal which is sort of sharp little bark twice repeated strange to say the natives of madagascar are much afraid of the of course it can not much mischief with its teeth or claws but they seem to think that it possesses some magic power by means of which it can injure those who try to catch it or even cause them to die so that they can not be bribed to capture it even by the offer of large reward sometimes however they catch it by mistake ﬁnding an in trap which has been set lemurs in that case they smear it all over with fat which they think will please it very much and then allow it to go free the is seldom seen in captivity and when in that state it sleeps all day long chapter iv the ba ts next in order to the monkeys come the bats the only mammals which are able to ﬂy it is quite true that there are animals known ﬂying squirrels which are sometimes thought to have the power of ﬂight but all that these can we shall see by and by is to take very long leaps through the air aided by the curious manner in which the loose skin of the body is fastened to the inner surface of the legs 24 25 26 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https b ats f ly bats however really can ﬂy and the way in which their wings are made is very curious if you were to look at bat skeleton you would notice ﬁrst of all that the front limbs were very much larger than the hinder ones the upper is very long indeed the lower is longer still and the bones of the ﬁngers are longest of all the middle ﬁnger of bat indeed is often longer than the whole of its body now these bones form the framework of the wing you know how the silk or satin of lady fan is stretched upon the ribs well very thin and delicate skin is stretched upon the bones of bat arm and hand in just the same way and when the little animal wants to ﬂy it stretches its ﬁngers apart and so spreads the wing when it wants to rest it closes them and so folds it against its body then you would notice that high bony ridge runs down the bat now such ridge this always signiﬁes great strength because muscles must be fastened at each end to bones and when the muscles are very large and powerful the bones must be very strong in order to carry them so when an animal needs very strong so that it may be able to ﬂy well we always ﬁnd high bony ridge running down its and to this ridge the great muscles which work the wings are fastened something more is necessary however if the animal is to ﬂy properly it must be able to steer itself in the air just boat has to be steered in the water otherwise it would never be able to ﬂy in the right direction so nature has given it kind of the skin which is stretched upon the wings is carried on round the end of the body and is supported there partly by the hind legs and partly by the bones of the tail and by turning this curious rudder to one side or the other or tilting it just little up or little down the bat is able to alter its course at will the u seful c law but you would notice something else on looking at bat skeleton you would notice that the bones of the thumb are not long and slender like those of the ﬁngers but that they are quite short and stout with sharp hooked claw at the tip the bat uses this claw when it ﬁnds itself on the ground it can not walk of course it has front feet so it hitches itself along by means of its thumbs hooking ﬁrst one claw into the ground and then the other and so managing to drag itself slowly and awkwardly forward it is not at all fond of shufﬂing along in this way however and always takes to ﬂight soon it possibly can but it can not well rise from the ground it has to climb to little height and let itself drop so that it falls it may spread its wings and ﬂy away and it always climbs in very curious manner with its tail upward and its head toward the ground using ﬁrst the claws of one little foot and then those of the other when bat goes to sleep it always hangs itself up by the claws of its hind feet in an old church tower or stable loft you may often ﬁnd bats suspended in this singular way and there is reason it the bat wants to be able at the ﬁrst sign of dang er to ﬂy away now if it lay ﬂat upon the ground to sleep most animals it would not be able to ﬂy quickly it would have to clamber up wall or post to some little height before it could spread its wings and this would take time but if it should be alarmed while it is hanging by its hind feet all that it has to is to drop into the air and ﬂy of f at once bats in the d ark there is something else too that we must tell you about bats they have the most wonderful power of ﬂying about on the darkest night without ever knocking up against the branches of trees or any other obsta cles which they may meet on their way it used to be thought that this was because they had very keen eyes but it has been found out that even blind bat has this power which seems really to be due to very sensitive nerves in the wings you can feel branch by touching it but bat is able to feel branch without touching it while it is eight or ten inches away and so has time to swerve to one side without striking against it 27 28 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https w inter s leep bats like hedgehogs and squirrels pass through the winter in kind of deep sleep which we call hibernation it is more than ordinary sleep they not require any food months together while they scarce ly breathe once in hours and their hearts almost cease to beat if the winte r is cold throughout they not wake at all until the spring but two or three hours warm sunshine arouses them from their slumber they wake up feel hungry go out to look little food and then return to their retreats and pass into the same strange sleep again an i nteresting s pecimen i once kept bat pet says writer and most interesting little creature he was one of his wings had been injured by the person who caught him so that he could not ﬂy and was obliged to live on the ﬂoor of his cage yet although he could take exercise he used to eat less than seventy large bluebottle ﬂies every evening long the daylight lasted he would take notice of the ﬂies at all they might crawl about all over him but still he would never move but soon after sunset when the ﬂies began to get sleepy the bat would wake up fixing his eyes on the nearest ﬂy he would begin to creep toward it so slowly that it was almost impossible to see that he was moving by degrees he would get within few inches then quite suddenly he would leap upon it and cover it with his wings pressing them down on either side of his body so to form kind of tent next he would tuck down his head catch the ﬂy in his mouth and crunch it up and ﬁnally he would creep on toward another victim always leaving the legs and the wings behind him which in some strange way he had managed to strip of f just we strip the legs from shrimps i often watched him too when he was drinking he was so crippled i used to pour few drops of water on the ﬂoor of his cage and when he felt thirsty he would scoop up little in his lower jaw and then throw his head back in order to let it run down his throat but in state of freedom bats drink by just dipping the lower jaw into the water they skim along close to the surface of pond or stream and you may often see them doing so on warm summer evening the p ipistrelle the pipistrelle common european bat is said to feed chieﬂy upon gnats of which it must devour very large number and it much prefers to live near human habitations there can be doubt that it helps to keep houses free from these disagreeable insects in captivity it will feed freely upon raw meat chopped very small it appears earlier in the spring than the other bats and remains later in the autumn horseshoe b ats these bats of the old world have most curious membrane upon the face which gives them very odd appearance in the great horseshoe bat this membr ane is double like one leaf placed above another the lower one springs from just below the nostrils and spreads outward and upward on either side so that it is shaped very much like horseshoe while the upper one is pointed and stands upright so partly to cover the forehead the ears too are very large and are ribbed crosswise from the base to the tips so that altogether this bat is creature perhaps none of the bats is more seldom seen than this it can not bear the light at all and never comes out from its retreat until darkness has quite set in and one very seldom ﬁnds it asleep during the day it almost always hides in dark and gloomy caverns which are hardly ever entered by any human being in france however there are certain caves in which great numbers of these bats congregate together their long winter sleep many hundred and eighty of them have been counted in single colony and it is very strange fact that all the male bats seem to assemble in one colony and all the female bats in another 29 30 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https in central and south america and also in the west indian islands number of bats are found which are known vampires some of these eat insects just like the bats of other countries and one of the most singular tongue both very long and very slender with tip so that it can be used licking out insects from the ﬂowers in which they are hiding then there are other vampires which eat fruit like the ﬂying foxes about which we shall have something to tell you soon but the best known of these bats and certainly the strangest are those which feed upon the blood of living animals if you were to tether horse in those parts of the forest where these vampires live and to pay it visit just the evening twilight was fading into darkness you would be likely to see shadowy form hovering over its shoulders or perhaps even clinging to its body this would be vampire bat and when you came to examine the horse you would ﬁnd that just where you had seen the bat its skin would be stained with blood this bat has the singular power of making wound in the skin of an animal and sucking its blood without either alarming it or appearing to cause it any pain and if trave ler in the forest happens to lie asleep in his hammock with his feet uncovered he is very likely to ﬁnd in the morning that his great toe has been bitten by one of these bats and that he has lost considerable quantity of blood yet the bat never wakes him it scrapes away the skin with its front teeth strangely enough however there are many persons whom vampires will neve r bite they may sleep night after night in the open and leave their feet entirely uncov ered and yet the bats will always pass them by charles waterton famous english traveler was most anxious to be bitten by vampire so that he might learn by his own experience whether the inﬂiction of the wound caused any pain but though he slept eleven months in an open loft through which the bats were constantly passing they never attempted to touch him while an indian lad who slept in the same loft was bitten again and again but these bats can not always obtain blood it is most likely that they not really live upon it but only drink it when they have the chance and that rule their food consists of insects flying f oxes of course these are not really foxes they are just big bats which feed on fruit instead of on insects or on blood they are called also but their long narrow faces are so curiously that we can not feel surprised that the name of ﬂying foxes should have been given to them flying foxes are found in many parts of asia well in madagascar and in australia and in some places they are very common in india long strings of these bats may be seen regularly every evening they ﬂy off from their to the orchards in search of fruit in some parts of india early in the morning and again in the evening the sky is often black with them far the eye can reach and they continue to pass overhead in an unbroken stream nearly of an hour and they roost in great numbers on the branches of tall trees every bat being suspended by its hinder feet with its wings wrapped round his body they look from little distance just like bunches of fruit it is rather curious to ﬁnd that when they are returning to the trees in which they roost early in the morning these bats quarrel and ﬁght the best places just birds in districts where they are at all plentiful ﬂying foxes great deal of mischief it is almost impossible to protect the orchards from their attacks even if the trees are covered all over with netting they will creep underneath it and pick out all the best and ripest of the fruit while they only pay their visits of destruction under cover of darkness it is impossible to lie in wait them and shoot them they come 31 32 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https ﬂight of the is not at all like that of the bats with which we are familiar they not feed upon insects there is need them to be constantly changing their course and darting ﬁrst to one side and then to the other in search of victims so they ﬂy slowly and steadily on following one another just crows and never turning from their course until they reach their the largest of these is the kalong which is found in the islands of the malay archipelago it measures over ﬁve feet from tip to tip of the extended wings the malays often use it food and its ﬂesh is said to be delicate and well ﬂavored chapter v the insect next to the bats comes the important tribe of the containing number of animals which are so called because most of them feed chieﬂy upon insects the c olugo one of the strangest of these is the colugo which lives in siam java and the islands of the malay archipelago it is remarkable its wonderful power of leaping it will climb tall tree spring through the air and alight on the trunk of another tree seventy or eighty yards away this reason it has sometimes been called the ﬂying colugo but it does not really ﬂy it merely skims from tree to tree and if you could examine its body you would be able to see at once how it does so first of all you would notice that the skin of the lower surface is very loose you know how loose the skin of dog neck is and how you can pull it up ever so far from the ﬂesh well the skin of the colugo is quite loose that on the sides and lower parts of its body then you would notice that this loose skin is fastened along the inner side of each leg so that the limbs are connected by membrane just like the toes of duck foot and you would also see that when the legs are stretched out at right angles to the body this membrane must be stretched out with them now when colugo wishes to take long leap it springs from the tree on which it is resting spreads out its limbs and skims through the air just an oyster does if you throw it sideways from the hand the air buoys it up you see and enables it to travel ten times far it could without this loose skin but of course this is not ﬂight the animal does not beat the air with the membrane between the legs bats and birds with their wings it can not alter its course in the air and it is always obliged to alight at lower level than that from which it sprang the colugo is about big cat and its fur is olive or brown in color mottled with whitish blotches and spots when it clings closely to the trunk of tree and remains perfectly motionless it may easily be overlooked it looks just like patch of bark covered with lichens and mosses it is said to sleep suspended from branch with its head downward like the bats and whether this is the case or not its tail is certainly prehensile like that of spider and strangest of all perhaps is the fact that although it belongs to the group of the it feeds upon leaves the h edgehog in european countries where it is common one can scarcely walk throug h the meadows on summer evening withou t seeing this curious animal it moves clumsily 33 34 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https in search of prey there everybody is familiar with its spiky coat which affords such an excellent protection against almost all its enemies but it is not everybody who knows how the animal raises and lowers its spines it has them perfectly under control we all know that if you pick hedgehog up it raises its spines at once even if it does not roll itself up into ball and so cause them to project straight out from its body in all direction but if you keep the creature pet and treat it kindly it will very soon allow you to handle it freely without raising its spines at all the fact is this the spines are shaped just like slightly bent pins each having sort of rounded head at the base and they are pinned it were through the skin the heads lying underneath it besides this the whole body is wrapped up in kind of muscular cloak and in this the heads of the spines are buried so if the muscle is pulled in one direction the spines must stand up because the heads are carried along with it if it is pulled in the other direction they must lie down the same reason and it is just by pulling this muscle in one direction or the other that the animal raises and lowers its spines hedgehog h abits the hedgehog is not often seen wandering about by day because it is then fast asleep snugly rolled up in ball under the spreading roots of tree or among the dead leaves at the bottom of hedge but soon after sunset it comes out from its retreat and begins to hunt about food sometimes it will eat bird eggs being very fond of those of the partridge which reason it is not at all favorite with the gamekeeper it will devour small birds too if it can get them also lizards snails slugs and insects it has often been known to kill snakes and to feed upon their bodies afterward it is cannibal too at times and will kill and eat one of its own kind but best of all it likes earthworms the number of these which it will crunch up one after another is astonishing i once kept tame hedgehog says naturalist and fed him almost entirely upon worms and he used to eat on an average something like an ordinary jampotful every night of his life he never took the slightest notice of the worms long the daylight lasted but when it began to grow dark he would wake up go snifﬁng about his cage till he came to the jampot and then stand up on his hind feet put his fore paws on the edge and tip it over and after about an hour and half of steady crunching every worm had disappeared in many places farmers persecute the hedgehog and kill it whenever they have chance of doing so and if you ask the reason the answer is generally to the effect that hedgehogs steal milk from sleeping cows at night now it does not seem very likely that cow would allow such spiky creature hedgehog to come and nestle up against her body but on the other hand it can not be denied that hedgehogs are often to be seen close by cows they rest upon the ground but they have not gone there in search of milk you know what happens if you lay heavy weight such big stone on the ground the worms buried under it feel the pressure and come up to the surface in alarm now cow is very heavy weight so that when she lies down number of worms are sure to come up all round her and the hedgehog visits the spot in search not of milk but of worms the young of the hedgehog which are usually four in number not look in the least like their parents and you might easily mistake them young birds their spikes are very soft and white so that they look much more like growing feathers the little creatures are not only blind but also deaf several days after birth and they can not roll themselves up till they have grown somewhat the mother animal always makes kind of warm nest to serve nursery and thatches it so carefully that even heavy shower of rain never seems to soak its way through strange to say the hedgehog appears to be quite unaffected by many kinds of poison it will eat substances which would cause speedy death to almost any other animal and over and over again it has been bitten by viper without appearing to suffer any ill results 35 36 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https england about the middle of october the hedgehog retires to some snug and hidden retreat and there makes warm nest of moss and dry leaves in this it hibernates just bats in hollow trees only waking up now and then an hour or two on very mild days and often passing three or four months without taking food shrews during the earlier part of the autumn you may very often ﬁnd curious little animal lying dead upon the ground but if you look at it carefully you will see at once that in several respects it is quite dif ferent from the true mice in the ﬁrst place you will notice that its mouth is produced into long snout which projects far in front of the lower jaw now mouse ever has snout like that then you will ﬁnd that all its teeth are sharply pointed while the front teeth of mouse have broad ﬂat edges specially meant nibbling at hard substances and thirdly you will see that its tail instead of gradually tapering to pointed tip is comparatively short and is squared in very curious manner the fact is that the little animal is not mouse at all but kind of shrew of which there are many american species one is large and pushes through the like mole another smaller is blackish and has short tail the commonest one is and only two inches long plus very long tail it is fond of water but has such interesting habits those of the european shrew next described these creatures are very common almost everywhere but we very seldom see them alive because they are so timid that the ﬁrst sound of an approaching footstep sends them away into hiding yet they are not at all timid among themselves on the contrary they are most quarrelsome little creatures and are constantly ﬁghting if two shrews meet they are almost sure to have battle and if you were to try to keep two of them in the same cage one would be quite certain to kill and eat the other before very long they are not cannibals rule however they feed upon worms and insects and just now and then upon snails and slugs and doubt they great deal of good by devouring mischievous grubs why these little animals die in such numbers just at the beginning of the autumn nobody quite seems to know it used to be thought that they were killed by cats or hawks or owls which refused to eat them because of some unpleasant ﬂavor in their ﬂesh but then one never ﬁnds any mark of violence on their bodies much more absurd idea was that they always die if they run across path which has been trodden by the foot of man perhaps the real reason may be that just at that season of the year they perish from starvation the w ater hrew the best way to see this pretty little creature is to go and lie down on the bank of stream and to keep perfectly still ﬁve or ten minutes if you t moving even will very likely see half dozen or more of the little animals at play they go rushing about in the wildest excitement chasing one another tumbling over one another and uttering curious little sharp short squeaks just like party of boys let out from school after long morning work suddenly one will dash into the water and dive quickly followed by another and then by third they swim away beneath the surface they look just like balls of quicksilver because their soft silky fur entangles thousands of little which reﬂect back the light just does and you will notice that they not swim straight first they turn to one side and then to the other side exactly like some one who has just learned to ride bicycle but does not yet know how to keep the front wheel straight and the reason is this the shrew swims by means of its hind feet which are fringed with long hairs so to make them more useful paddles and it uses them by striking out ﬁrst with one and then with the other the consequence is that when it strikes with the right foot its head turns to the left while when it strikes with the left foot its head turns to the right but it would not be able to swim even straight it does if it were not its tail which is fringed with long hairs just like the hind feet and the little animal paddles its 37 38 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https through the water it keeps its tail stretched out behind it and uses it rudder turning it little bit to one side or the other so to help it in keeping its course after chasing one another under water minute or two the little animals give up their game and now if you watch them carefully you can see them hunting food first they go to one stone down at the bottom of the stream and then to another poking their long snouts underneath in search of shrimps or the grubs of water insects but minute or two later they are all back on the bank again dashing about and chasing one another and squeaking merrily ever sometimes you may see water which is very much darker in color than the others the fur on the upper part of its body being almost black it used to be thought that such animals this belonged to different species to which the name of oared shrew was given but we know now that they are only dark varieties of the common water shrew jumping s hrews these are all found in africa they are curious little creatures with extremely long hind feet by means of which they leap along just if they were tiny kangaroos so swift are they that it is very difﬁcult the eye to follow their movements and they disappear into their burrows at the slightest alarm and not come out again some little time few people ever have chance of watching their habits the snouts of these shrews are so very long that the little animals are often known tree hrews this is group so called because they spend almost the whole of their lives in the trees in some ways they are not unlike tiny squirrels being nearly activ in their movements and sitting up on their hind quarters to feed while the food is held in their fore paws they are found in various parts of southern asia they soon become very tame actually entering houses and climbing up on the table while the occupants are sitting at meals they will even drink tea and coffee out of the cups and if they are encouraged they make themselves quite at home and will drive away any other shrews which may venture into the house the largest animal of this group is the tupaia which lives in borneo and sumatra but the most curious is the which has double fringe of long hairs at the end of its tail arranged just like the barbs of feather so that its tail looks very much like quill pen the rest of the tail whic h is very long is covered with square scales and while the tail itself is black the fringe of hairs is white so that the appearance of the animal is very odd it is found in sarawak and also in some of the smaller islands of the malay archipelago the d esman this animal may be described kind of mixture of the and the water it has an extremely long and ﬂexible snout and it spends almost its whole life in the water its feet are very well adapted swimming the toes being joined together by membrane like those of the duck and the swan so that they form most exquisite paddles and the animal is so fond of the water that although it lives in burrow in the bank of stream it always makes the entrance below the surface this is very good plan in one way if the little animal is chased by one of its enemies it can easily take refuge in its long winding tunnel which twists about so curiously and has so many side passages that the pursuer is almost sure to be bafﬂed but in another way it is bad plan the burrow has entrance except the one under water it never gets properly ventilated the only connection with the outer air being some chance cranny in the ground and in winter when deep snow has covered up 39 40 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https cranny while the surface of the strea m is frozen to depth of several inches the poor little desman can get fresh air at all and often dies in its own burrow from suf focation this animal has curious musky odor which is due to certain glands near the root of the tail so strong is this odor that if pike happens to have swallowed desman few days before it is caught its ﬂesh can not be eaten its whole body both smells and tastes strongly of musk two kinds of desman are known one is the russian desman which is found in the steppes and the other is the pyrenean desman which lives in the range of mountains from which it takes its name the c ommon m ole this is perhaps the most interesting of all the have you ever noticed how wonderfully it is suited life which is almost entirely spent under the ground notice ﬁrst of all the shape of its body it is pointed cylinder now that is the very best shape burrowing animal because it offers so little resistance to the ground the creature forces its way along and nowadays we make all our boring tools and weapons of that shape the gimlet which has to bore through wood the bullet which has to bore through air the torpedo and the submarine boat which have to bore through are all made in the form of pointed cylinders and the mole is pointed cylinder too its body is the cylinder and its head is the point and so the animal is able to work its way through the soil with little difﬁculty possible then notice the character of its fur it has set in it you can stroke it backward or forward with equal ease and this is most important in an animal which lives in burrow if mole had fur like that of cat it would be able to travel head foremost through its tunnel quite easily but it could not move backward and this would never sometimes the mole is attacked by an enemy in front while it has room to turn round in order to retreat so nature has made its fur in such way that it gives in either direction and enables the little animal to move either forward or backward with equal ease w ondrous d igger see what wonderful front paws the mole broad so very strong and armed with such great stout claws they are partly pickaxes and partly spades which can tear away the earth and ﬂing it up into molehills with the most wonderful speed the rapidity with which mole can dig is really marvelous three times writer tells us i have seen moles walking about on the ground each time i was within ten yards of the animal each time i ran to the spot and yet each time the little creature had disappeared into the ground before i could get there it did not seem to be digging it simply seemed to sink into the soil just though it were sinking into water then just see how hard and horny the skin of the paws is if it were not this the mole would be always cutting itself with sharp ﬂints it dug its way through the ground notice too how both the eyes and ears are hidden away under the fur so that fragments of earth may not fall into them natur has been very careful to suit the mole to the strange life which she calls upon it to lead perhaps animal is so strong its size the mole its muscles and sinews are so hard that they will turn the edge of knife if mole could be magniﬁed to the size of lion or tiger and its strength could be increased in corresponding degree it would be by far the more powerful animal of the two the m ole and its f ood the reason why the mole is so strong and so well suited life under ground is that it is meant to feed partly upon worms and partly upon such grubs wireworms which live on the roots of plants and the appetite of the animal is astonishing it is ever eating and yet never appears to be satisﬁed think of keeping mole pet because if you you will have to spend almost the whole of your time in digging up 41 42 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https it to eat say indeed that if mole goes without eating three hours it is in danger of starvation so that the animal must spend the greater part of the day and of the night too in searching food how does it ﬁnd the worms and grubs well of course it can not see under ground so sometimes we may think it smells them its scent is certainly very keen but oftener most likely it hears them moving about its ears are even keener still have you noticed that although you may often walk through ﬁelds which are almost covered with molehills you never see the earth being thrown up that is because the mole hears you coming it hears your footsteps when you are hundred yards distant or even more and immediately stops work until you have gone away again in the tempest caliban tells his companions to tread softly that the blind mole may not hear footfall although shakespeare was wrong in thinking that moles are blind he was quite right in reminding us that they have very sharp ears friend or f oe the gardener of course looks upon the mole foe and so it is when it drives its tunnels under our lawns and throws up great heaps of earth on the surface of the grass and the farmer regards it foe too and kills it whenever he has an opportunity but perhaps the farmer may not know what busy little animal the mole is and what thousands and thousands of mischievous grubs it devours there are wireworms which nibble away at the roots of plants till they kill them and then move on to destroy other plants in the same way there are leather or grubs which feed upon the roots of grass and sometimes ruin all the turf in meadow there are also the great fat white grubs of beetles which are worse perhaps than either and many others well now the mole is always preying upon these it eats them in hundreds every day of its life and just think of all the misc hief that they would have done if they had been allowed to live doubt it is annoying to the farmer to have molehills among his hay which blunt the knives of the and prevent them from cutting properly but even that is better than having hay to cut and there would be none if all these mischievous grubs were allowed to live but there is another way well in which the mole is useful the earth which it digs up from down below and throws up in heaps on the surface of the ground serves what the farmer calls after time you see the nourishment in the soil at the surface is sucked out of it by the roots of the grass if it were in garden the farmer could dig it if it were in or he could plow it but in meadow he can neither without destroying the pasture so he applies he gets some good rich earth from elsewhere and spreads it over the surface and this earth works down to the and gives them just the nourishment they require now this is exactly what the mole is always doing the earth which it throws up is fresh rich earth from down below which the roots have not reached it is just what the failing grass requires and if the farmer rakes the molehills down so to spread this earth evenly over the surface of the ﬁeld he ﬁnds that it forms quite good any he could apply himself so instead of looking upon the mole one of his enemies he ought to include it in the list of his laborers the l ittle w ell igger another thing that we must tell you about the mole is the way in which it obtains water it is very thirsty animal and constantly requires to drink at the same time it can not leave its burrow half dozen times day in order to visit stream or pond it would almost certainly be killed by one of its many enemies so it actually digs little wells of its own always doing so in the dampest parts of its tunnels where they ﬁll up almost immediately and when it wants to drink it just goes off to the nearest of these wells and satisﬁes its thirst the m ole s f ortress 43 44 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https the most wonderful thing that the mole does is to make what we call fortress surrounding the chamber in which it sleeps this fortress is situated either in natural mound of earth or else beneath the spreading roots of tree or large bush and it is made in this way first the mole digs short circular gallery little way under this it digs another rather larger in diameter and connects the two by means of ﬁve short passages in the middle of the mound and about between the two galleries it scoops out large round hole from which three passages run to the lower gallery this is the mole bedroom and it communicates with the main burrow by tunnel which dips under the lower gallery finally number of runs branch out from the lower gallery in all directions so you see if mole is chased by an enemy it can nearly always escape by passing through its fortress it goes up one passage down another up again by third down again by fourth and then off by one of the side runs so that its pursuer is almost sure to be bewildered and if the little animal should be surprised while asleep it can escape in any direction without losing even moment the mole always likes to make itself comfortable it collects together quantity of dry grass moss and leaves and piles them up in the central chamber so to make warm and cosy bed and the female mole makes nursery her little ones in much the same way fierce f ighters sad to say moles are very quarrelsome little animals and frequently ﬁght when they meet here is an account of one of their battles written by passer who happened to witness it walking along quiet lane i heard some very funny little squeaks proceeding from the other side of the hedge i am perfectly used to all sorts of animal and bird sounds but had never heard the like of these befor on getting cautiously over the hedge i found two moles ﬁghting in the ditch i went to within two yards of them but they took not the slightest notice of so intent were both on their business i at once looked at my watch they kept on up and down scratch and bite seven minutes when one turned the other completely over on his back and seized him by the throat which he cut cleanly if done by knife thus ﬁnishing the ﬁght the way in which they used their formidable front feet was surprising the s tar nosed m ole this mole is found in the united states and canada it is very animal its muzzle is shaped into long snout at the tip of which is circle of ﬂeshy rays of rosy red color which look like the petals of red daisy or the spreading arms of anemone these rays can be opened wide or closed up at pleasure and seem to serve very delicate or gans of touch helping the animal in ﬁnding and catching its prey this mole is also remarkable having very long tail which is more than half the length of the head and body the total length is about seven inches chapter vi the larger ca ts now we come to the beasts of prey foremost among which stand the members of the great cat tribe all these animals have their bodies formed in very wonderful way 45 46 47 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of all their eyes are intended use chieﬂy by night if you look at cat eyes during broad daylight when the sun is shining you will notice that the pupils through which she sees are nothing more than mere narrow slits in the middle look at them again toward evening when the twiligh t is just beginning to creep on and you will see that the pupils are good deal bigger occupying nearly half the eyeball look at them once again when it is almost dark and you will ﬁnd that they are bigger still having widened out over nearly the whole of the eye now the eyes of lion and tiger are made in just the same way the darker the night the more the pupils expand so that they may be able to take in the few rays of light that there are we sometimes say that these animals can see in the dark that of course is mistake in perfect darkness animal can see at all but even on the darkest night there is always some light and matte r how little there is it is enough to allow lions and tigers to see perfectly well because of the wonderful way in which their eyes are made the s teal thy t read but these creatures not only want to be able to see their victims on dark night they also want to be able to creep up to them without making the slightest sound it would be quite useless instance lion to chase deer because the deer is by far the swifter animal of the two if the lion is to catch the deer at all he must sprin g upon it unawares and strike it down before it knows its danger and this is not at all easy the ears of deer are very sharp and if the lion were to make the least noise while creeping up it would take the alarm directly but under his great broad paws the lion has soft ﬂeshy cushions which enable him to walk along without making any noise at all have you noticed how silent cat tread is you simply can not hear her place her foot upon the ground well lions and tigers walk in just the same noiseless manner so that the deer never hears them creeping up and is struck down and killed before it has time to realize its danger four grea t ca ts lion and lioness canada l ynx 48 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https cheeta tiger but suppose that there are bushes in the way suppose example that in order to approach the deer at all the lion must creep through thicket is he not quite sure to brush up against branch he does so causing the leaves to rustle and will not the deer hear the sound and take the alarm well doubt this would happen if the lion had to depend his silent approach only on the soft cushions under his feet but then you see he has whiskers well perhaps you thought these were only meant ornament but they are meant use and they are employed in very curious manner when they are spread out on either side they measure from tip to tip exactly the width of the body besides this there is very delicate sensitive nerve at the root of every whisker which runs straight to the brain so you see if the tip of whisker is touched the brain feels it directly and if the lion is creeping through the bushes his outsprea d whiskers brush against the branches he knows at once that there is room him to pass without making noise and alarming his victim so he draws his head back and creeps up by another way killing and ating then it is very important that his claw s should be kept sharp he depends upon them tearing his victim down so every claw ﬁts into sheath which protects the point and prevents it from being worn down by rubbing against the ground you can easily see these sheaths by examining the paw of cat and those of the lion and tiger are formed in just the same way and the muscles which work them are so arranged that they keep the claws always drawn back except just when the animal uses its paw in striking and then once more these animals have very curious tongues have you noticed when cat has licked your hand how very dry and rough her tongue feels it is quite different from the smooth wet tongue of dog well the tongue of lion or tiger is even rougher still and if you were to look at it sideways you would see why it is covered all over with sharp projections the points of which are directed toward the throat the reason is this lion or tiger does not succeed in killing prey every night sometimes it hunts one night sometimes two nights sometimes even three nights without any success at all so that when it does catch victim it wants to eat much of its ﬂesh it possibly can and if its tongue were not made in this singular manner it would have to waste great deal its teeth can not tear off nearly all the ﬂesh of the bones by means of its rough tongue however it can lick off even the tiniest scraps and not even the smallest atom has to be wasted if you give dog bone which is too big him to crunch up and swallow you will always ﬁnd that he leaves good deal of meat upon it but if you give similar bone to hungry cat you will ﬁnd that she licks it perfectly clean that is because her tongue is made in just the same way that of lion lions about forty different kinds of cats are known most of which are found in the warmer parts of africa and asia the most famous of all of course is the lion which is spread over the greater part of the african continent and is also found in persia and in india we need not describe the lion everybody knows perfectly well what it is like but perhaps you not know that the india n lion hardly ever has mane this reason it was formerly thought that there were two different kinds of lions the indian animal being quite different from that found in africa but we now know that this is not the case and that the indian lion is only kind or variety not distinct species but there are very few lions left in india now while even in persia they are not nearly so plentiful they used to be in many parts of africa however these animal s abound and it is not at all an uncommon thing six or eight to be seen together during the daytime the lion is generally fast asleep lying up in thicket or in bed of reeds by the side of pool or river but soon night falls he leaves his retreat 49 50 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https begins to prowl about in search of prey roaring loudly from time to time one would think that this would only alarm other animals and lead them to seek safety in ﬂight but when lion roars he generally puts his head close to the ground and this has the effect of making it almost impossible them to tell from which direction the sound is coming so that they not know how best to try to escape him and very often in their bewilderment they rush to the very spot where he is lying in wait when lion springs upon his victim he either kills it by stroke from his terrible paw or else bites it in the throat or across the back of the neck he then drags it away to some convenient retreat eats his ﬁll and returns to his lair to sleep next day very likely he will return to the carcass another meal but when he gets there he often ﬁnds that the jackals and hyenas have discovered it and left very little him wherever lion goes he is almost sure to be followed by number of jackals all anxious to feast on the remains of the animals he kills but he never allows them to approach until he has eaten much he can possibly swallow and it is said that if one of them attempts to so he will catch it and bite off all its paws warni ng to the others to be more respectful according to great many hunters the lion is not nearly so courageous it is generally supposed to be and is really rather cowardly animal they say example that it will hardly ever face man unless it is brought to bay but will always try to slink away and escape if they kill deer and want to protect its body from the lions they can always so by tying two or three streamers of white cloth to sticks planted round the carcass so that they ﬂutter in the wind and though the animals may prowl round and round all through the night roaring loudly from time to time they will never venture to approach within ﬁfteen or twenty yards neither will they attack tethered horse if the bridle is left hanging from its neck all hunters agree however that if lion is wounded or if it sees chance of escape it is most terrible foe and can not be encountered without the utmost peril if lion is captured while quite young it is very easily tamed and can even be taught to perform all kinds of tricks at the word of command but lions born in captivi ty are not nearly so easy to manage and can never be depended upon moment lions generally have three or four cubs at birth and the little animals are just playful at kittens but although they are always ready good romp it is not wise to play with them baby lion is big cat and is very much stronger so that bite from its teeth or blow from its paw is rather serious matter the ﬁrst few months of their lives the cubs are brindled almost like tigers the stripes disapp earing by degrees the fur grows darker they not reach their full size until they are about four years old tigers the tiger is found principally in the jungles of india although it is spread over the greater part of central and southern asia in some respects it is ﬁner animal than even the lion it is certainly stronger it is quite courageous and it is nearly large though the shortness of its legs and the absence of mane cause it to appear good deal smaller probably any one on seeing tiger the ﬁrst time would imagine that it must be very conspicuous animal in its native jungle but matter of fact this is not the case at all long tiger keeps perfectly still it is most difﬁcult to see him even if you happen to be looking straight at him his bright orange fur marked with glossy black stripes looks just like the yellow leaves of the with streaks of deep shadow between them this coloring of course helps the tiger in two ways in the ﬁrst place when he is hunting it enables him to creep up to his victims without being seen and in the second place when he is being hunted himself it often helps him to crawl away without being noticed in some parts of india tigers are still extremely common and of course they great deal of mischief they are very fond of preying upon domesticated cattle and sometimes every four or ﬁve days months together the same tiger will kill and carry 51 52 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https bullock from the same herd he generally kills his victims by spring ing upon them suddenly seizing their throats with his jaws and then wrenching their heads backward and sideways so to break their necks then he will either drag away the carcass into the jungle at once or he will hide close by and come back in order to feast upon it when night is beginning to fall of course tiger can not devour the whole of bullock body at one meal but at the same time he does not care to leave the remainder the jackals so when he has eaten his ﬁll he nearly always ﬁnds sleeping place close by so that if he should wake up and hear party of jackals quarreling over the carcass he can rush out at them and drive them away man aters but worse by far than the tigers are the these are sometimes said to be the old and almo st toothless animals which can longer kill buffalo or bullock and therefore take to preying upon human beings instead but very often quite young animal becomes and it is said that if tiger should once taste human blood he will always prefer it afterward to any other food tiger will often throw whole district into state of terror day after day he will conceal himself among the thick bushes which border native road and lie in wait solitary one day perhaps man will be carried off the next day woman the day after child one knows where the animal is hiding and sometimes he will succeed in killing ﬁfty or sixty human being s before he is discovered and destroyed tiger unting when the natives kill tiger they generally so by driving him into small clump of jungle surrounding it with stout netting and then spearing him through the meshes or perhaps they will climb tree close to the carcass of bullock which the animal has killed and shoot him when he comes at dusk to feast upon its remains but in oudh the tiger is said to have been formerly destroyed in very curious way number of leaves of the prauss tree which are large and broad like those of sycamore were smeared with kind of and laid upon the ground in the animal path when he came along one of these leaves would stick to his paws and he would ﬁnd that he could not shake it off so he would try to remove it by rubbing it against his face the only result of course would be that his nose and eyes became covered with meanwhile he had trodden upon other leaves which he tried to remove in the same way before very long his eyelids were stuck down so that he could not open them then he would lie down and rub his face upon the ground covering it with earth and so making matters worse by this time he would be thoroughly frightened and begin to howl pitifully so that when the hunters came running up they found the poor beast an easy prey europeans however hunt the tiger by means of elephants which have to be carefully trained before they can be depended upon to face the furious animal number of elephants are generally employed the hunters riding in howdahs seats ﬁxed upon their backs while several hundred natives perhaps act beaters shouting and yelling beating drums ﬁring guns and making much din they possibly can to frighten the animal from its retreat sometimes it is so terriﬁed that it slinks out and falls an easy prey but now and then it will charge the nearest elephant with the utmost fury sometimes springing upon it and almost reaching the howdah before it is killed by directed bullet the number of tiger cubs in litter varies from two to ﬁve or even six although families of more than three are not very common the little ones not reach their full size until they are three years old and during the whole of that time they go about with their parents leopards 53 54 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https smaller than either the lion or the tiger but still very large and powerful animal is the leopard which is sometimes known the panther it is spread over almost the whole of africa and also over the greater part of asia and in many distric ts is very common you can always recognize the leopard by its markings the ground color of the fur is bright yellow with just tinge of red in it becoming lighter on the ﬂanks and passing into white on the lower surface of the body the spots are black and those on the back and sides are always enclosing patch of yellow sometimes however the whole of the fur is black but even then you can see the spots which look something like the markings in watered silk somehow these black leopards always seem far more savage than the others and those who have them under their care say that it is quite impossible to tame them in spite of its smaller size the leopard is nearly powerful the tiger and in some ways is an even more formidable foe it is much more active instance and is more easily roused into rage while it can climb trees like cat and spring down upon passer by from among the branches it does not rule attack man and will always seek safety in ﬂight if it can but if it is brought to bay it will ﬁght furiously and nothing will check it but bullet through the heart or the brain when it can so the leopard always likes to live near the habitations of man because there are so many opportunities of springing upon pony sheep or goat at night too it will rob the or make its way into the pens where the calves are kept and carry one of them off before its presence is even suspected dogs too fall victims to it in great numbers and now and then it succeeds in pouncing upon an unwary monkey when it kills an animal it does not leave the carcass lying on the ground the tiger does and visit it night after night until it is consumed but carries parts of its body up into tree and hides them in kind of larder which it has made among the branches those who have hunted it say that the leopard is far more difﬁcult animal to kill than the tiger the reason is that it is so much more wary tiger it creeps through the jungle will look most carefully in front of it it moves along well on either side but it never seems to think of looking up into the branches of tree above to see if an enemy is hiding there so very often the hunter is able to shoot it before it has the least idea that it is in danger but leopard is much more cautious and never comes back to its lair or to the remains of its kill without carefully examining the boughs above well the bushes below so that unless the hunter is well concealed the animal is almost sure to discover him and to crawl silently away before he has got the chance of shot the unce this animal looks rather like leopard with very fur but the spots are good deal larger the fur is very much longer and thicker and the tail is almost bushy that of persian cat the reason why the fur is so thick is that the ounce lives in very cold countries it is found high up in the mountains of central asia ascending during the summer to height of perhaps eighteen thousand good deal higher than the summit of mont coming down to the lower levels in winter in other words it is hardly ever seen below the and is often known the leopard so it wants good thick warm fur we not know very much about its habits it is very difﬁcult animal to watch in state of nature very few people ever see it but it seems to prey chieﬂy upon wild goats wild sheep and those odd little burrowing animals that we call marmots and also upon domesticated sheep and cattle which are sent up to graze on the higher slopes of the mountains it is said never to venture to attack man the j aguar still more like leopard is the jaguar which lives in central and south americ but you can tell it at once by looking at the marks on its body most of which have either one or two small patches of dark brown fur in the middle it also has three or 55 56 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https bold black streaks across its breast which are never seen in the leopard and its tail is ever so much shorter the tip scarc ely reaching to the ground when the animal is standing upright the jaguar is perhaps even better climber than the leopard and seems far more at its ease among the branches than on the ground indeed there are some parts of the great swampy forests of brazil in which the animal is said never to descend to the ground at all but to spend its whole life in the trees which stand so close side by side that it can easily spring from one to another you wonder perhaps what it feeds upon why upon monkeys and very active indeed it has to be if it wishes to catch them but then when band of monkeys discover jaguar they are never able to resist the temptation of getting close to him they dare and chattering and screaming loudly they can just to annoy him is that exactly like monkeys but sometimes they venture little too close and then with sudden spring he seizes the nearest of his impudent tormentors and carries it shrieking away birds too are often caught by the jaguar who pounces upon them they are roosting upon branch but he is not at all particular to what he eats and sometimes he will leave the trees altogether and go hunting in the by the riverside capybaras which we will describe farther on he is very fond of these animals they are so slow in their movements that they can not run away so badly provided with natural weapons that they can not ﬁght and so fat and delicate that they afford most excellent eating then just change perhaps he will stroll down to the and look good big turtle when he sees is generally female on her way back to the water after laying her eggs in the seizes it suddenly with his fore paws and turns it over on its back so that it canno t possibly escape then perhaps if he is not very hungry he leaves it little while but soon he returns and manages to scoop out all the ﬂesh of the animal from between the shells by means of his long hooked talons thrusting in his paw over and over again till scarcely the smallest particle is left remaining very likely too he will ﬁnd the spot where the turtle had laid her eggs dig them up and devour them well sometimes he will crouch on the bank of stream quite close to the water and hook out the ﬁsh that pass by with his claws and when he is very hungry indeed he will eat lizards and even insects like the ounce however the jaguar seldom or never ventures to attack human being although he will ﬁght savagely if he is driven to bay but he will often spring upon horses and cattle and in such cases he nearly always kills them by seizing their heads between his front paws and giving sudden wrench sideways and upward so to break their necks like most of the cats the jaguar has fondness scratching the trunks of trees and sometimes tree may be found with gashes in its bark an inch deep and more than yard long the p or c ougar next to the jaguar the puma is the largest of the american cats male being sometimes much eight feet in total length of which about three feet is taken up by the tail in color it is tawny brown becoming lighter on the lower surface and without any spots at all but the odd thing is that its young are marked all over with large blotches of blackish brown while their tails are ringed with black like that of the tiger and these markings not disappear until they are more than six months old the puma is found in almost all parts of the american continent from british columbia in the north to patagonia in the south and it is even said to have been seen in tierra del fuego it spends some part of its life in the trees being almost good climber the jaguar but it almost always hunts upon the ground trying to creep stealthily up to its victim and to spring upon it before its presence is even suspected 57 58 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https scarcely ever ventures to attack man but will often follow him long distance though waiting an opportunity to pounce upon him unawares but if he suddenly turns and faces the animal it will always slink away even if he is quite unarmed sometimes too it will allow itself to be killed without attempting to defend itself at all so hunters have rather poor opinion of its courage the farmers however have very good reason dreading the animal it is terrible enemy to sheep and has been known to kill many ﬁfty in single night and it will also leap suddenly upon horses and cattle and break their necks just the jaguar does although in some ways it is such cowardly creature the puma will often ﬁght the jaguar itself of course it is the weaker animal of the two but it is so exceedingly quick in its movements and makes such excellent use of its teeth and talons that in many cases it gets the best of the battle sometimes when jaguar is killed by hunter its back is found to be deeply scored all over by the claws of puma in many parts of north america the puma is known the panther or painter also the mountain lion and it has other names besides the c louded l eopard there is still one more of the larger cats which we must not pass by without mention and that is the clouded leopard or clouded tiger which is found in the southeastern parts of asia and in the larger islands of the malay archipelago in size it is about big small leopard and its yellow brown fur is marked with stripes like those of the tiger spots like those of the leopard rosettes like those of the jaguar and blotches like those of the ocelots while its tail is adorned with rings of glossy black so you see it is very handsome animal we not know very much about its habits but it seems to live almost entirely in the trees and to prey chieﬂy upon birds while those who have caught and tamed it say that it is very gentle and playful the malays call it the or and there is smaller variety found in the same localities which is generally known the marbled cat chapter vii the smaller ca ts the smaller members of the cat tribe include many interesting animals of which our readers if not already informed concerning them will be glad to learn something the s erval unfortunately although this is quite common animal in many parts of africa we know very little about its habits but it appears to prey chieﬂy upon the smaller antelopes creeping silently up to them they are grazing and springing upon them so suddenly that they never know that they are in danger until they are struck down in south africa where it is good deal more numerous than it is in the northern parts of the continent the dutch call the serval the or because it looks like rather big cat and lives in the thick bushy parts of the veldt it is pretty animal and would be prettier still if its short stumpy tail were little longer its fur is bright golden yellow marked with dark spots some of which run into one another and so form stripes underneath the body the fur is nearly white while the ears are with broad white band running across them in length the animal measures about three feet ten inches of which are taken up by the tail and it stands about eighteen inches in height 59 60 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https celot this is one of the handsomest of all the cats it is found in almost all parts of tropical america but it is not very easy animal to describe because it varies so much in color that until few years ago naturalists thought there were several different kinds of ocelots to all of which they gave separate name rule however the ground color of the fur is either brownish yellow or reddish gray while the back and sides are marked with rows of streaks and spots and blotches which sometimes run into one another in such way to look almost like stripes the length of the animal is about four feet of which about ﬁfteen inches is occupied by the tail and it stands from sixteen to eighteen inches in height the ocelot is found only in forest distric ts and is an excellent climber spending most of its life in the trees it feeds chieﬂy upon birds hiding among the thick foliage until they settle within reach and then knocking them over with its ready paw or it will spring down upon them they alight on the ground below it seems to like the head of bird best of all and generally eats that ﬁrst and very often it will pluck its victim most carefully before proceeding to devour it the animal called the margay is really kind of small ocelot and it is sometimes known the tiger the gyptian c at in this we have most interesting animal not only because it seems certain that it is the ancestor of the cats we keep now pets but also because in days of old the people of egypt used to venerate it just they also did the arabian baboon in every way they treated it with the greatest possible honor indeed to kill cat in those days was far more serious offence than to kill man and if the offender was discovered he was certainly made to pay the penalty with his life and when the animal died its body was carefully embalmed and wrapped in spices and was then solemnly buried in the tombs of the kings if you ever go to the metropolitan museum of art in new york or to the boston museum you may see the mummied remains of some of the very cats which were venerated by the people of egypt ﬁve thousand years ago in the british museum is an old painting which is interesting although in different way it shows us that while the ancient egyptians held the cat in such high honor they expected it to make itself useful in return the picture represents hunter and his family going out on an expedition in search of water and from it we learn that they would embark in boat with several decoy birds together with carefully trained cat they would then push off into the great beds of tall reeds which fringed the sides of the river and sit in the boat while the cat went and caught birds them which were attracted within reach by the decoys in picture we have seen the cat is represented with one bird in her mouth another in her fore paws and third between her hind paws so that if she got all three back to the boat she must have been very clever cat this animal is sometimes known the caffre cat and it is found wild in almost all parts of africa and also in syria and arabia in size it is about big rather large domestic cat and in color is generally yellowish gray with few faint stripes across the back and several darker ones on the hind quarters while the tail is marked with black rings and always has black tip the w ildca t the true wildcat is european animal in the united states what is commonly called wildcat is really species of bay called bobcat it is found in nearly all the states east of the mississippi river that have lar ge forests if you were to see real wildcat in captivity you would most likely think that it looked very gentle creature but in reality it is one of the ﬁercest and most savage of all living animals and matter how kindly it is treated it never seems to become tame 61 62 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https wildcats are nearly always found in thickets in mountain districts which are hardly ever trodden by the foot of man they mostly live either in hollow trees or in crevices among the rocks where they bring up their litters of little ones they keep their kittens in very good order we have heard of wildcat which was kept in large otter cage with pool of water in the middle and there she brought up three kittens one day she heard strange footstep approaching now she could not bear strangers and would never allow them to look at her little ones so she jumped into the and called to her kittens to come in after her two of them obeyed the third preferred to stay outside so out she jumped soused it three times in the water just to teach it to be more obedient in future and then carried it of f by the scruf f of its neck wildcat is about inches long without the tail which is much shorter and more stumpy than that of the domestic cat the thick soft fur is gray in color brindled with black another kind of wildcat is found in the northern parts of africa and also in persia and india sometimes it is called the and sometimes the chaus it is rather bigger than an ordinary cat and is sandy gray or grayish brown in color with just few darker streaks across the legs it lives rule among long grass and reeds and in ﬁelds coming out to hunt only by night so very few people ever see it in wild state and we not know very much about its habits but it must be rather formidable animal to meet writer tells us that which he kept some years pet was more than match two powerful english which used to attack her day after day but always got the worst of the battle the c aracal you may see this animal at some zoo and if you go to look at it your ﬁrst idea will most likely be that it is very red soon you come near its cage it is almost sure to throw back its ears show its teeth and spit and hiss and snarl at you and to look if it would ﬂy at you in moment if only the bars were not in its way and so doubt it would it is one of the most savage of all the cats and can not be tamed without very great difﬁculty unless it is caught while very young the name caracal signiﬁes and has been given to the animal because its ears are in color they also have long tuft of dark hairs at the tip the head body and legs are bright reddish brown but some caracals are good deal lighter than others and now and then the lower parts of the body are marked with dull reddish spots the height of the animal is about eighteen inches at the shoulder and the length of the body and tail together is from three to four feet caracals are found in india and arabia and also in most parts of africa they live among bushes and long grass rule and prey upon the smaller deer and antelopes and also upon birds which they are said sometimes to capture even on the wing springing into the air and seizing them between their fore paws they ﬂy past 63 64 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https fierce ca ts mexican ocelot young himalayan snow leopard saharan serval american jaguar the l ynx this creature appears somewhat like stoutly built caracal but the ears are gray instead of black the tufts of hair upon them are good deal longer and the fur of the body is gray generally marked with number of darker spots its curious appearance however is due to the fact that it has an enormous pair of very bushy whiskers which hang down far below the chin not so very long ago the lynx was found commonly in many parts of europe and it is still tolerably plentiful in norway sweden and the northern parts of russia well in northern asia but it is very much persecuted by the hunters two reasons in the ﬁrst place it is very destructive creature couple of lynxes have been known to kill six sheep between them in single night in the second place its fur is so thick so soft and so warm that its skin sells good deal of money so great many lynxes are shot or trapped every year and before very long the animal will most likely disappear from europe altogether doubt you have sometimes heard the expression used of somebody whose sight is unusually good and certainly the lynx is very in days of old it was actually thought that the animal could see right through solid wall easily we can through pane of glass the lynx is good climber and spend s great part of its life in the trees often lurking among the branches in order to spring down upon an unsuspecting victim it passes below but it mostly makes its lair among rocks just the wildcat does there it brings up its two or three little ones which are playful little creatures but very tempered if any one interferes with them however they are easily tamed if they are captured while quite small and will follow their master about just like dog another kind of lynx called the pardine lynx inhabits the south of europe from spain far turkey 65 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https are also found in canada but it is not quite certain whether these belong to different species or not at any rate they are rather smaller than those which live in europe and asia and their tails are hardly ever more than ﬁve inches long they live in the deepest parts of the forests and in thick bushy districts so that they are not very often seen and they prey upon hares and other small animals and also upon such birds grouse and partridges when one of these lynxes is running through long grass it looks very odd it travels by means of series of leaps all four of its feet coming to the ground together we have already mentioned the bay lynx of the united states which in size is equal to the canada lynx the c hetah last among the cats comes the very curious chetah or which is found both in africa and in india in some ways however it is much more like dog than cat its head is quite small and round its body is very slender and its legs are much longer in proportion to its size than they are in any other member of the family but more remarkable still the claws are not entirely drawn back into their sheaths while not in use they are in all the true cats but partly project so that the points are worn away by constantly rubbing against the ground so we may consider the chetah partly cat and partly connecting link joining the two families together if it were not the length of its limbs however the chetah might very well be mistaken leopard its head and body are colored and marked in much the same way but the spots are solid so to speak and not they are in the leopard the animal stands from thirty to inches in height at the shoulders and the body and tail together are about seven feet long the chetah does not capture its prey other cats lions tigers and leopards example always try to creep up quite close to their victims so that they may be able to pounce upon them at single spring but the chetah only creeps up to within about two hundred yards and then runs them down in fair chase it is exceedingly swift of foot being able easily to outrun greyhound so that when once it starts in pursuit its victim has but little chance of escape indeed chetah has actually been seen to put up blackbuck two hundred yards away and to run it down within quarter of mile just fancy being able to run nearly twice fast an antelope in india the chetah is often caught and tamed in order that it may catch game its master it is always taken out to the in light cart drawn by pair of bullocks and its eyes are covered with kind of hood when deer or an antelope is sighted this hood is taken off and the chetah is released from its chain sooner does it catch sight of its quarry than it creeps quietly toward it until it is within distance and then starts off in pursuit like an arrow shot from bow the hunters ride quietly after it and before they have gone very far they are sure to ﬁnd the chetah with its victim pinned upon the ground then the throat of the animal is cut and some of the blood is given to the chetah to drink after which it is again blindfolded and is led back to the cart when the natives want to catch chetah or two in order to train them hunting they so in rather curious way although these animals can not climb trees because of the manner in which their claws are made there are certain trees to which they are very fond of resorting in order to sharpen their talons upon the bark so the natives make number of nooses of raw hide and arrange them on the ground all round one of these trees and when they visit them next day they are almost sure to ﬁnd that two or three chetahs have been snared it is needless to say that this beautiful and interesting animal is very easily tamed if it is kindly treated it will rub its great round head against one put up its tail and purr loudly just like big cat 66 67 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https viii the civets the and the hyenas between the great tribes of the dogs and the cats come three small but rather important families one of which contains the civets while the belongs to the second and the hyenas to the third we must tell you little about each civets first of all then come the civets and ﬁrst among the civets is the fossa which is found in madagascar this is very curious animal it is about ﬁve feet long from the end of its snout to the tip of its tail and has body shaped much like that of weasel its fur is pale reddish brown in color and reminds one of the coat of dachshund dog but the oddest thing about the fossa is its way of walking some animals walk on the tips of their toes like the cats and the dogs we call these digitigr ades others plant their feet ﬂat upon the ground like the bears we call these plantigrades but the fossa does neither its feet have soles only the front part being quite bare underneath while the hind part is covered with hair and it walks the animal places the bare part of its feet upon the ground while the hind part is lifted up so that it is half digitigrade and half plantigrade then it has claws just like those of cat which are drawn back into sheaths while not in use so that their sharp points may not be worn down by rubbing against the ground doubt this is the reason why the animal is able to climb so well if you go to look at the fossa in zoo you will be quite surprised at its activity in its double cage with one compartment above the other and two or three stout branches on which it can take exercise it goes running up and down from one to the other and backward and forward from the branches to the walls and from the walls to the branches with such wonderful swiftness that it is really not at all easy to follow its movements but be tempted to stroke the animal if it happens to be lying quietly near the bars although it looks very gentle it is in reality most savage creature and has hardly ever been tamed and partly this reason and partly because it only comes out to hunt prey by night we know very little about its habits the true civets have much stouter bodies than the fossa their heads are long and narrow with the muzzle drawn out almost into point their legs are quite short and along the back runs crest of stiff hairs which can be raised and lowered at will just like the spines of the hedgehog civet p erfume six different kinds of civets are known ﬁve of them being found in asia and one in africa and they are chieﬂy remarkabl producing most powerful perfume this perfume is obtained in very curious way it is secreted in kind of double pouch under the body close to the root of the tail and it is continually being formed the animal is much too valuable to be killed in order that its pouch may be emptied at the same time its teeth and claws are so sharp and strong and it knows so well how to use them that it would be most dangerous creature to handle so when the perfume has to be taken the animal is forced into long and very narrow cage in which it is held so close prisoner that it can neither scratch nor bite then the contents of the pouch are scraped out by means of long slender spoon which is passed through hole under the cage each side of this pouch is about big an almond and the contents are thick and greasy in character almost like butter when the animal is at liberty the perfume is dropped from time to time in lumps about big an ordinary hazelnut indian c ivet 68 69 70 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https best known of these animals is the indian civet which is about four feet in length including the tail the general color of its fur is dark gray sometim es with yellowish tinge and on the chest shoulders and thighs are number of dark stripes the crest of hairs along the back is glossy black and the tail is marked with six black rings and ﬁve white ones it is solitary animal and is hardly ever seen during the daytime which it spends in hiding among bushes or in long thick grass coming out after dark to search the lizards frogs birds and other small creatures upon which it feeds genets the genets may be described small civets with narrower bodies shorter legs and longer tails and without the curious pouch producing perfume one of these animals the common genet is found in spain and the south of france well in southwest asia and the northern parts of africa it is between three and four feet in total length and is yellowish gray in color with blotches of dark brown scattered all over the body it is very gentle creature and is easily tamed being often kept in houses to destroy rats and mice just we keep cats the live in trees chieﬂy in and they are so fond of drinking the sweet juice or toddy which the natives collect in small vessels suspended on the trunks that they are often known one of these animals is very common in many parts of india where it is in the habit of taking up its abode in the thatched roofs of the native huts it is often tamed by europeans and after roaming about the house all night in search of mice and cockroaches will come up to its master bedroom jump up on his bed snuggle away under his pillow and there sleep soundly until late in the following day but if it ﬁnds chance it will get into the and kill some of the fowls in order to suck their blood so that it has to be looked after very carefully there are ten or eleven different kinds of these animals the commonest of which is the indian it is about big rather big cat and is brownish gray in color with very coarse and rather ragged fur it has an odd way of twisting up its tail into very tight coil and this reason is someti mes known by the name of paradoxure word which signiﬁes queer the b inturong the binturong or it is often called may be recognized at once by the long tufts of black hair upon its ears its fur too is entirely black without any gloss except upon the head which is gray and its tail is very long and bushy and is prehensile at the tip like that of spider when the animal is climbing it makes great deal of use of this organ seldom moving unless it is tightly coiled around branch but it seems hardly ever to hang from bough by its tail alone the spider so often the binturong is native of assam siam and some of the larger islands in the malay archipelago it is not at all an uncommon animal but is seldom seen it not only lives in the thickest and darkest parts of the forests which are scarcely ever trodden by the foot of man but spends the whole of the day fast asleep in some snug retreat with its head completely buried beneath its big bushy tail and even if it is found and disturbed it only gives an angry snarl and shows its teeth and then goes to sleep again mongooses of course you have heard of the mongooses they look somewhat like weasels with very long tails which are thickly covered with hair the head is pointed with rather sharp nose the ears are small and rounded the legs are very short and the claws can not be drawn back into sheaths so that they are always projecting like those of dog the general color of the body is either brownish or reddish gray but the fur has peculiar speckled appearance which is due to the fact that all the longer hairs are marked with alternate rings of black and white like those upon surveyor 71 72 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https least sixteen kinds of mongooses are found in different parts of the world but we shall only be able to tell you about two the ﬁrst of these is the indian mongoose which is common in almost all parts of the great country from which it takes its name and it is one of the most useful of all animals although it will feed upon mice small birds and their eggs lizards and even upon insects and fruit when it is really hungry there is nothing of which it is so fond snake now snakes are more plentiful in india perhaps than in any other country in the world many of them are terribly poisonous and kill at least twenty thousand people every year so that an animal which destroys them is very useful many people keep tame mongooses in their houses just we keep cats knowing that if snake should ﬁnd its way indoors they are sure to ﬁnd it and kill it when mongoose attacks snake it dances about in front of the reptile and pretends to be about to spring upon it until the snake strikes then like lightning it leaps over the snake head or underneath its open jaws or round to one side and gives it sharp bite just at the back of its neck this renders the snake quite harmless paralyzing it so that it can not use its fangs then the mongoose crunches up its head eats little of the body also if it is very hungry and goes of f to look another rats too are killed in great numbers by the mongoose so in the year 1871 when these animals swarmed in some of the west indian islands to such an extent that it was feared that the sugar plantations would be wholly destroyed by them nine mongooses were set free in jamaica very soon they began to multiply and the rats began to decrease till in about two years time the mischievous little animals were almost entirely destroyed so mongooses were turned down in other islands with equally satisfactory results unfortunately however the mongooses soon found out that fowls and chickens were even nicer than rats and began to visit the at night then they took to killing young lambs and even small pigs while they also did great deal of damage to mangoes and yams so now the planters had to turn their attention to destroying mongooses and on one estate alone more than fourteen hundred were trapped in about two months the egyptian mongoose is rather larger animal being about three feet in length from the head to the tip of the tail like its indian relation it preys upon snakes but it also feeds very largely upon crocodile eggs which it digs out of the sand on the banks of the rivers this reason it was venerated by the ancient egyptians who used to treat it with the greatest reverence while it lived and to embalm its body and bury it in the tombs of the kings when it died just they did with the cat and the sacred baboon meerka ts the last of the animals about which we can tell you is the meerkat sometimes known the suricate it is found in south africa and is small slender bodied animal of light grizzled gray color with number of black stripes running across its back while the ears are black and the tail is yellowish with black tip meerkats live in large colonies almost like rabbits each animal scratching out itself deep hole in the ground if you were to drive across the south african veldt you would very likely come across one of these curious meerkat warrens and would see several hundred of the little animals sitting upright on their hind legs with their front paws hanging down just like so many small dogs begging until you came quite close they would remain quietly watching you but the moment that you stopped and attempted to seize one of them there would be sudden whisk of hundreds of tails and down they would all pop into their burrows if by magic they are gentle creatures and very clean in their habits meerkats are often kept pets and in many parts of cape colony there is scarcely single house without them you would think that the dogs would be very jealous of them would you and that they would be very much afraid of the dogs but strange to say the two are nearly always the best of friends and may often be seen trotting about after their master together 73 74 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https ard olf this is such very odd animal that it has been placed in family all by itself though there can be doubt that it is related to the civets on the one side and to the hyenas on the other in size it is about big fox but with very much longer legs and in general appearance it certainly resembles striped hyena but then its skull and teeth are not at all like those of hyena they are like those of very big mongoose so the evidently forms connecting link between the two creatures the name means and has been given to this animal because the dutch people in south africa thought that it really was kind of wolf and because it lives in deep burrows which it digs in the ground strange to say although each digs its own burrow several of these tunnels often unite in one large central common it is used by all the animals alike but each always goes in and out by its own front door during the daytime the is nearly always fast asleep under ground so that it is hardly ever seen except by those who go out to hunt it but it is not often hunted being so timid and cowardly that when it is turned out of its burrow its only idea is to run away fast it possibly can so that it af fords very poor sport this animal is not creature of prey but feeds chieﬂy on carrion but it is rather fond of insects and will sometimes break hole in the side of termites nest and lick up the inmates by thousands they come hurrying up to repair the breach in the walls hyenas these are not very animals their sloping hind quarters give them very slinking and cowardly appeara nce in their habits too they are disgusting nevertheless they are most useful creatures in the countries in which they live they belong to that vast group of animals which we may call nature dustmen because their great work in life is to clear away the rubbish from the world there are millions upon millions of these natural scavengers and some of them have to clear away carrion some to clear away skins and some to clear away decaying vegetable matter but the principal duty of the hyenas is to clear away bones and very thoroughly they it their jaws and teeth are immensely strong hyena will seize the of an ox and crush it up into splinters easily dog will crush and when lion or tiger kills victim he always leaves great part of the carcass lying on the ground some of it he has time to eat because the jackals come and steal it while he is fast asleep after the big meal which he always takes soon he has killed his victim some of it neither he nor the jackals can eat because their teeth are not nearly strong enough to crush the larger bones so they have to leave these the hyenas which come up in numbers to the kill and quarrel and ﬁght over it until nothing even of the skeleton remains although the hyena is much stronger animal than the it is quite cowardly and will hardly ever show ﬁght even when it is driven to bay the arab hunters despise it its want of courage and if they ﬁnd it hiding in burrow will never condescend to kill it themselves neither will they use any weapon against it they just ﬂing handful of wet mud into its face drag it out by its hind feet and hand it over to be stoned to death by the women but sometimes after all it contrives to escape it is so cunning that it will pretend to be dead when it is not really injured allowing itself to be pulled about or even to be severely beaten without moving limb then suddenly when the attention of its captors is taken of f moment it will jump up and run away perhaps you wonder why they should want to kill the hyena if it is such useful creature and never attacks human beings the reason is that it is fond of prowling about the outskirts of villages in order to prey upon the cattle it is much too cowardly to attack them openly and always tries to frighten them and make them run away so that it can leap upon them from behind it generally does this by creeping close to them it can and then springing up suddenly just under their eyes but if they stand and face it instead 75 76 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https running away it just looks at them few moments and then slinks off without attempting to touch them the s triped h yena three different kinds of these animals are known the commonest being the striped hyena which is found in india syria persia arabia and northern africa it is about big collie dog and is brownish gray in color with number of black stripes running across the body and round the legs the ears are long and pointed the tail is big and bushy and kind of mane of long hairs runs down the neck and along the middle of the back in some parts of africa these animals roam about by night in large packs entering the native villages and searching the streets the offal which has been thrown out from the huts and more than once when very hungry they have been known to enter house and carry of f sleeping man sometimes they will set kind of snare dog one hyena will lie in wait behind bush while another will run boldly up to within two or three hundred yards of the village and utter series of loud howls dog is almost sure to hear him and to rush out in pursuit then the hyena pretending to be dreadfully frightened runs away past the bush where his companion is hiding and the dog is pounced upon and killed almost before he realizes that he has two enemies to deal with instead of only one the b rown h yena this kind of hyena found in south africa is not nearly so numerous that just described it is about the same size the striped hyena but may be recognized at once by the great length of its mane which hangs down on each side below the body in fact the animal looks just if it were wearing mantle of thick shaggy fur it lives chieﬂy in rocky ground on the lower slopes of the mountains but is fond of visiting the by night and prowling about in search of the dead bodies of ﬁshes and other creatures ﬂung up by the waves the s potted h yena the the spotted hyena is also called is much more dangerous than the other hyenas it is larger and more powerful animal than either of its relations and is not near so cowardly it will enter sheepfold or instance under cover of darkness and boldly attack and carry off one of the animals but even an unarmed man need not be afraid of it though it will come quite close and will follow him long distance it will never venture to spring upon him this animal is often known the laughing hyena because of the extraordinary sounds it utters when very much excited these sounds are not in the least like yell or howl but resemble peal of strange unearthly laughter and while they are being uttered the hyena dances about on its hind legs nods its head up and down runs to and fro and twists itself into all sorts of singular positions just though it had suddenly gone mad travelers tell us that sometimes nights together sleep is rendered impossible by the hideous outcry of these creatures which surround the camp soon darkness sets in and never cease from their horrible din till sunrise the spotted hyena is found throughout southern africa and may be known from the other two species by its larger size and also by the spots with which the body and the limbs are marked 77 78 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https ix the dog tribe next in order comes the great tribe of the dogs which includes altogether about forty different animals we are not speaking of domestic dogs we have not space in which to tell you about those indeed if we were to say all that might be said about them they would want very big book all to themselves and fortunately there are many good books about domestic dogs that readers who desire them can easily get but besides the tame dogs there are two or three wild dogs in the dog tribe several wolves several jackals and several foxes and many of them are very interesting creatures the d hole first of all there is dog which is known by three different names sometimes it is called the dhole sometimes the kholsun and sometimes the buansuah it lives in india but it is not very often seen it keeps to the thickest parts of the jungle and never ventures near the habitations of man yet it is by means cowardly animal like the hyenas and the on the contrary it is extremely courageous and does not seem to know what fear is it will even attack the tiger itself and more than that will kill it of course the tiger is by far the stronger and more formidable animal of the two and if he only had one dhole to reckon with there would be doubt to the issue of the combat but the dhole always hunts in packs sometimes there are eight or ten animals in one of these packs sometimes there are ﬁfteen sometimes there are many twenty or even thirty and so ﬁerce are they and so determined and so persevering that it is said that when they once put up an is start it from matter whether it be lar ge or small they never fail to kill it the deer of course are swifter than they are but then the deer become tired much sooner than the dholes and while they are resting their pursuers catch up with them the tiger is much more powerful and has his talons and fangs to ﬁght with but while he is killing one of his foes three or four more are leaping upon him and even if he should succeed in killing half the pack the rest will still go on ﬁghting savagely ever they not dread the horns of the buffalo or the tusks of the wild boar in fact they dread nothing and animals are so feared in the jungle when the pack are running they never bark or yelp or bay almost all domesticated dogs the most part they are silent the only sound which they utter being low whimper in color the dhole is rich bay which becomes rather darker upon the ears the muzzle and the tip of the tail the d ingo this is the only member of the dog tribe found in australia and many naturalists think that it is not really native of that continent but was brought there very long time ago from some other country but the dingo is not now found in any other part of the world it is quite impossible to say whether this is actually the case or not it is very animal about big large with wn coat pointed upright ears and bushy tail and if you were to see it you would most likely think that it must be very gentle animal we have already seen however that there are several creatures which look very gentle but are in reality most savage and ferocious and though the dingo is not quite so ﬁerce the fossa or the wildcat its appearance is not at all in keeping with its character it is very and hard to tame and is always liable to ﬁts of rage in many ways the dingo is not unlike the dhole it lives in packs instance which scour the country in search of prey these packs are always led by one of the strongest and most experienced animals which has won its position by ﬁghting and overcoming all 79 80 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https rest and when the leader begins to grow old and feeble younger and stronger animal takes his place by overcoming him in the same way in some strange manner these packs divide up the country among themselves each pack has its own district allotted to it over which it may roam at will while it is never permitted to hunt outside its own borders would it be interesting to know how these districts are marked out and how the animals arrange what part of the country shall be allotted to each pack wolfish group coyote red fox hyena dog or hunting dog tasmanian pouched wolf tasmanian devil gray wolf when the ﬁrst white colonists settled down in tasmania they found these packs of dingoes terribly troublesome they would visit the folds night after night and carry off the sheep and lambs in numbers watchers were employed to shoot them traps were set them huge bonﬁres were lighted to keep them away but all to purpose one colony lost twelve hundred sheep from their ravages in less than three months another lost seven hundred at last the settlers banded themselves together in war against the dingoes and by hanging pieces of poisoned meat to the branches of trees about foot from the ground they succeeded in greatly reducing their numbers so that now they are comparatively scarce dingo which was kept at the london zoo many years ago used to sit outside his kennel and bay at the moon so loudly that his dismal howling could be heard all over the regent park the c rab eating d og two or three kinds of wild dog are also found in south america but of these we can only mention the dog which is chieﬂy found in the forests of guiana demerara and brazil this animal owes its name to its great fondness crabs even domestic dogs will often eat these creatures i once had terrier called says writer whose greatest delight was to be taken walk along the so that he might hunt crabs whenever he found one he would ﬂing it up into the air half dozen times or so until it was perfectly dazed then holding it down with one paw he would twist off 81 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https great claws so that it could not nip him and ﬁnally he would crunch up its body and lick out pieces of ﬂesh from the shell now and then however he would get pinch and i would see him dancing about on his hind legs with crab hanging to his lip howling pitifully to come and set him free whether the dog gets nipped in the same way sometimes we can not tell you most likely he does at any rate he spends great deal of his time in hunting crabs on the shore but he also feeds on small animals and birds and it is said that sometimes he hunts in packs like the dingo and the dhole which even run down and kill the deer wolves of are really only large and very savage wild are several different kinds first of all of course there is the common wolf of europe we have all read accounts of its ferocity and of the way in which it sometimes pursues travelers through the russian forests during the depths of winter in days of old it was plentiful in england while the last wild wolf in scotland was not killed until the middle of the eighteenth century during the spring summer and autumn the wolf is mostly found singly or at any rate only in pairs but when the ground is covered with snow and food becomes scarce the hungry animals gather together in packs which scour the forest in all directions and kill every living creature which they meet in the year 1875 less than 161 human beings fell victims to them in russia while the mischief which they in the farmy ards and sheepfolds is very great in livonia alone instance during single year sheep cattle horses goats pigs 703 dogs and geese and fowls were destroyed by wolves in some parts of france too these anim als are still not uncommon although reward of one hundred francs is paid every adult wolf that is killed and thirty francs each cub and they are also found in almost every other country in europe when they are not famished with hunger wolves are by means courageous animals and if we have many tales of their savage ferocity we have quite many more which bear witness to their cowardice in norway example large tract of country in which wolves had always been only too numerous was suddenly deserted by them and what you think was the reason simply that telegraph wire had been put up which frightened the wolves so much that they left the neighborhood altogether and never came near it again and if hunter kills deer and wishes to leave the carcass lying on the ground while and at the same time to protect it from the wolves all that he has to is to plant three or four sticks beside it with streamers of white cloth fastened to the tips not wolf will dare to approach the spot long these are ﬂuttering in the wind when wolves are running they generally utter series of dismal howls which are so loud that they can be heard by any one miles away and even single wolf can make such an outcry that more than once traveler hearing one howl has imagined that large pack were in pursuit of him and has climbed into tree and spent the whole night among the branches before discovering his mistake wolves usually make their lairs among rocks or in the trunk of hollow tree or among thick bushes but sometimes they live in holes in the ground which they seem to dig out themselves there are generally from six to ten cubs in litter which are born in the spring and not leave their parents at least eight or nine months strange to say the father often seems much fonder of them than the mother he will take care of them and hunt them and teach them how to hunt themselves weeks after she has left them altogether wolves in i ndia 82 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https common wolf is by means conﬁned to europe but is also found in many parts of asia and throughout almost the whole of north america in india however there is another kind of wolf which is rather smaller and has very much shorter fur it is seldom seen in large packs and hardly ever howls the common wolf does it is not in the habit rule of attacking human beings but now and then two or three of these animals will band together to attack man while sometimes they will prowl round the outskirts of native village in the hope of being able to carry of f some of the smaller children these animals have very clever way too of killing deer three or four of them will creep quietly up and hide themselves near the spot where the deer are feeding then another will come dashing up from the opposite direction the result of course being that when the frightened animals run away they pass close to the very place where their enemies are lying concealed coyotes on the great plains of north america lives very handsome wolf called the coyote or it is good deal smaller than the common wolf but has much thicker and longer fur so that it looks bigger than it really is and very odd thing about it is that it is differently colored at different seasons of the year being reddish yellowish brown in summer and grayish or even quite gray in winter the back is generally darker than the rest of the body and the tail is rather long and very bushy the coyote takes the place of the hyena scavenger but has some of the habits of the fox it catches birds and jackrabbits and feeds on insects well small rodents like and mice its melancho ly howls make night hideous to it is the steady foe of young creatures such the fawns of deer the skin of this animal is thick and makes good fur wraps coyotes assemble in packs like jackals it is not an easy matter to destroy them they are so wary that it is almost impossible to approach within gunshot often single coyote will great deal of mischief before it can be killed poison kills great many but good fence of wire netting has been found to be the best remedy against these troublesome creatures jackals jackals may be described half wolves and half foxes one of these animals the common jackal is found in great numbers in the south of asia and north of africa and the southeastern corner of europe sometimes it is seen singly sometimes in pairs but generally it associates in great packs which go roaming about the country together in india these packs visit the native villages by night to carry away any offal which may have been thrown out of the houses they are nature dustmen you see like the hyenas then they will follow lion or tiger about weeks in order to feast upon the carcasses of the animals which he kills after he has eaten his ﬁll and when twenty or thirty of these ravenous creatures are all struggling and ﬁghting over the body of deer or an antelope you can easily imagine that in short time there is not very much of it left the jackal is sometimes called the lion provider but we may say that the lion ought rather to be called the jackal provider the natives of africa say that the jackals stand very much in awe of the lion and seldom dare even to show themselves until he has eaten his ﬁll of his victim body and has gone away to sleep and they also declare that if jackal comes too near the carcass before the lion has ﬁnished his meal the lion catches him and bites off all his paws in order to teach the rest of the pack better manners the howling cry of the jackal is very strange and weird and the animals call to one another and answer one another just if they were carrying on conversation first comes long wailing yell then another rather higher then another little higher still and then three short sharp barks and so on over and over again when jackal is caught it often preten ds to be dead and will be perfectly still very long time in the hope of being able to make its escape when the attention of its 83 84 85 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https is taken off on one occasion one of these animals lay without moving whole hour although several times it was picked up and worried by dog then quite suddenly it jumped up and rushed away apparently unhurt the common jackal is reddish brown in color sometimes lighter and sometimes darker while the tip of the tail is black but there is another kind of jackal found in south africa which has the whole upper part of the back black and the lower part of the body and the inner sides of the limbs nearly white this animal is called the jackal while third which has pale streak running across its ﬂanks is called the striped jackal in habits the three animals are almost exactly alike foxes the of the foxes of course is the common fox of great britain and western europe which is also found in many other parts of the world this animal is famous its cunning and certainly in many ways it is very clever it has all sorts of tricks example to throw the hounds off its track when it is being hunted it seems to know perfectly well that it is followed by scent and sometimes it will suddenly leap to one side so to break the trail and then make off in quite different direction sometimes when it has sufﬁcient start it will return on its track sixty or seventy yards and then leap aside or it will roll in carrion in order to disguise its own peculiar odor hunter tells us that he once found fox burrow which was very cleverly made the entrance to it was about twen ty feet from the edge of in the middle of thick clump of bushes and there was about half way down the side of the pit so when the fox was chased he could run into his burrow by the upper entrance slip out by the lower one and so make his escape through the pit while the hounds were all gathered round the hole up above very often fox will climb tree sometimes to great height and hide among the branches and we have heard of fox which bafﬂed the hounds over and over again in most ingenious way he used to run to certain fence spring to the top and then walk along several hundred yards before leaping down again to the ground by doing this of course he broke the scent most thoroughly and long before the hounds could ﬁnd it again he had reached place of safety but although the fox is generally so clever he sometimes does the most stupid things possible charles waterton tells us of fox which visited and carried off eight young turkeys he could not eat them all of course so he buried ﬁve in the ground meaning doubt to come and fetch them away on the following evening but apparently he thought that if he buried them entirely he might not be able to ﬁnd them again so he carefully left one wing of each bird sticking up above the surface to serve guide and never seemed to reﬂect that others would be able to see it well himself so the farmer recovered his turkeys and when reynard came to look his supper next night he found that it had disappeared the burrow of fox is sometimes an old enlar ged to suitable size but generally the animal scrapes out burrow himself frequently choosing the roots of large tree situation or very rocky piece of ground from which it will be very difﬁcult to dig him out in this burrow four or ﬁve little ones are brought up they are creatures with very snub noses and if you did not know what they were you would never take them young foxes the rctic f ox this animal more interesting still perhaps lives in the regions of the far north there are often several of these to be seen in zoo and the ﬁrst thing that one notices on seeing them is that two of them are alike one perhaps is reddish brown above and yellowish white beneath another is gray all over third very likely is mottled while fourth may be of that curious bluish color which we see in russian cats in fact in the snowy polar regions great many of these foxes turn perfectly white in winter this enables them to creep over the snow without being seen by their victims 86 87 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https when warmer weather comes and the snow begins to melt their fur passes back again to its original color during the spring and summer the arctic fox feeds on and their eggs and it is said to attract the birds to the place where it is lying in wait by imitating their peculiar cries but we not think that that is true what it feeds upon during the rest of the year is rather doubtful it can not catch birds they have all ﬂown away farther south it can not catch ﬁshes the water is covered in by ice several feet in thickn ess most likely it catches numbers of those odd little animals known lemmings just winter begins and stores them away in kind of larder where the cold prevents their bodies from decaying the arctic fox is good deal smaller than the common fox and has ears so short and rounded that they look just if they had been cropped in order to allow it to travel over the slippery ice the arctic fox has the soles of its feet covered with long stiff hairs which give it perfectly ﬁrm foothold on the frozen surface the arctic fox is not nearly such clever animal the common fox and is very easily trapped if hunter follows one it will certainly run into its hole but moment or two later it is almost sure to poke out its head in order to yelp at him so that he is easily able to shoot it the consequence is that these animals are destroyed in very great numbers the sake of their skins those with bluish fur being especially valuable skins of these foxes are in truth among the most costly of furs in view of this men interested in the in alaska have endeavored to raise them in captivity so to obtain constant supply of their pelts this experiment has succeeded best on certain island in bering sea where large colony of arctic foxes is kept guarded and tended by eskimos who feed them and who once year catch and kill certain number when their fur is in its best condition american f oxes besides the arctic fox which of course is found in american well other arctic regions this country has many species of fox that belong peculiarly to itself william hornaday director of the new york zoölogical park who has written many instructive things about animals tells us in his am erican natural history that north of mexico this continent has sixteen distinct species of foxes some of which have several subspecies the american fox most widely found is that which hornaday calls our wise old friend the red fox which is so well known in many parts of the country it is very cunning creature so well able to take care of itself that it refuses to be exterminated still we are told that it was not hard the early settlers in this country to outwit the red foxes and to shoot them and trap them when they came into the clearings where the settlers made their homes it is easier to get the better of these animals in wild region than where many people live the foxes are sharp observers and appear to learn many things from seeing what their human neighbors naturalists tell us that in this way the american foxes have come to be almost intelligent those of the old world the red fox we are told now holds his own against man much by boldness and audacity by caution few of our wild animals look on man with so little awe you must have read many stories illustrating this boldness of the fox often shown in robbing and even catching chickens in the yards or the ﬁelds and quite remarkable are the accounts of foxes cunning in avoiding hunters and hounds in fact they have often been known to follow the very hunter who was looking them though they wanted to learn all his ways so to be better able to bafﬂe him the gray fox which is somewhat smaller than the red fox belongs especially to the southern part of the country but it ranges northward far into the home of the red fox it is very wild and can move swiftly sometimes to escape from dogs it will climb small tree and get far above the pursuer reach it is at its best only in the forest and can not hold its own the red fox does in country much inhabited by men with all his slyness 88 89 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https gray fox lacks that astonishing shrewdness and faculty working out schemes which enables the red fox to turn the tables on the hunter all the different varieties of american fox are more or less closely related to the one or the other of these red fox and the gray that naturalists class them in two groups the red fox group and the gray fox group if you learn all that you can about them you will ﬁnd that you have obtained great deal of interesting knowledge the f ennec this is very pretty little animal found in nubia and egypt it is only about twenty inches long including its big bushy tail and its fur is sometimes pale fawn color and sometimes creamy white but what strikes one most about it is the extraord inary size of its ears which are always carried perfectly upright and look if they were intended an animal at least ﬁve times big itself the fennec is creature of the desert and lives in burrows which it scoops out in the sand in order to make these burrows more comfortable it lines them with leaves hair and the feathers of birds while they are nearly always situated beneath the roots of plants where the sand is softer and more easy to work the animal digs with the most wonderful speed and those who have surprised it while at distance from its burrow say that it disappears in the sand just though it were sinking into water and is lost to sight in few seconds the fennec spends the heat of the day comfortably curled up in its burrow with its nose tucked away under its big bushy tail when the sun sets it wakes up and goes off to the nearest water to drink after which it hunts jerboas birds lizards insect s and the various other small creatures upon which it feeds the h unting og although member of the great dog tribe this animal is not really dog it looks very much like spotted hyena and yet it is not really hyena sometimes it is known the and perhaps that is the best name which can be given to it these animals are found throughout southern africa and are especially numero us in cape colony they hunt in packs of from ten to ﬁfty or sixty which run with such wonderful speed that even the swiftest antelopes can not escape them when they catch up with their quarry they all spring upon it together snapping at it over and over again until they bring it to the ground and in few minutes there is nothing left of its carcass but just few of the lar ger bones in size the is about big wolf in color it varies good deal but the head is always black with white mark round the eyes while the body is more or less mottled with black white and yellow the long bushy tail is yellow at the root black in the middle and white at the tip chapter x the weasel tribe almost all the animals which belong to this tribe have very long slender bodie s and very short legs and the reason is simple one they feed on living prey which they often have to follow through long and winding burrow now if they had stout bodies or long legs they could not this most likely they could not enter the burrow at all and even if they did so they would be almost sure to ﬁnd before they had gone very far that they could neither move forward or backward but having such bodies and such 90 91 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https short limbs they can wind their way through the tunnels without any difﬁculty and then spring upon their victim at the end they always try to seize their prey by the throat in order to tear open the great vessels which pass through that part of the body one who had personal expe rience of the strength and sharpness of their teeth thus tells it i was walking through park one day early in the autumn when i noticed that the dead leaves under tree were tossing and tumbling about in very curious manner on going little closer i found that mother weasel and her little ones were playing together when i came up of course they all ran away so i ran after them and caught one of the little animals by putting my foot on it just hard enough to hold it down on the ground without hurting it and immed iately the little creature which was only about six inches long twisted itself round and drove its sharp teeth into the edge of the sole of my shoe both from above and below so that if i had done what i thought of doing at ﬁrst and had stooped to pick it up its teeth would certainly have met in my ﬁnger the weasel is common in many parts of the united states well in europe in some regions you can scarcely take walk along the roads or through the ﬁelds without catching sight of it very likely it will poke its head out of hole in the bank at the side of the road and watch you in the most inquisitive manner you go past or you may notice it slipping in and out of the herbage at the foot of hedge it searches the small creatures on which it feeds but very often it will leave the hedge and follow mole along its burrow or it will make its way to wheatstack and pursue the mice through their runs and it is very fond of going out and robbing the nests of the eggs or little ones which they contain but the weasel is not always successful when he sets out on one of these expeditions while coming down helvellyn mountain in england writer witnessed strange little scene hearing loud chattering he says i looked up and saw just above pair of stonechats and weasel evidently the weasel had come too near the nest of the birds and they were trying to entice him away and this is how they managed it first the cock bird sat down on stone about yard in front of the weasel and began to ﬂap his wings and to chatter and scream the weasel immediately darted at him and the bird ﬂew away next the hen bird sat down on another stone yard farther on and began to ﬂap her wings and to chatter and scream then the weasel darted at her and she ﬂew away soon she had gone the cock came back sat on third stone and played the same trick again and so the two birds went on over and over again till they got the weasel far up the mountain side quite two hund red yards from the nest when they quietly left him and ﬂew away together was it clever of them and the odd thing was that the weasel never realize d that he was being taken in but evidently thought he was going to catch one of the birds every time that he darted at them when fully grown the european weasel is from eight to ten inches long abou t fourth of that length being occupied by the tail the fur of the upper parts of the body is brownish red in color while that of the throat and lower surface is white in the united states are found various species of weasels the largest of which is called the new york weasel the length of the male is sixteen inches that of the female thirteen inches the tail being more than of the total length it is also called the weasel the smallest species is the least weasel only six inches long both bear much resemblance to stoats the various kinds of weasels in this country say stone and cram in their american animals are much alike in their habits they hunt tirelessly following their prey by scent and kill the mere joy of killing often leaving their victims uneaten and hurrying on more the s toat or rmine this is the commonest and most widely distributed of all the weasel tribe the name is british the fur of the lower parts of the stoat body is pale yellow instead of white while the tip of the tail is black in very cold countries the whole of the fur becomes white in winter like that of the arctic fox the tip of the tail alone excepted indeed the 92 93 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https ermine fur which we value so highly and which even kings wear when they put on their robes of state is nothing but the coat of the stoat in its winter dress the stoat preys upon rather larger animals than other weasels and many hare and rabbit falls victim to its sharp little fangs strange to say when one of these creatures is being followed by stoat it seems almost paralyzed with fear and instead of making its escape by dashing away at its utmost speed drags itself slowly and painfully over the ground uttering shrill cries of terror although it has not been injured at all in the stoat is sometimes terribly mischievous one stoat has been known to destroy many forty fowls in single night so both the gamekeeper and the farmer have very good reason disliking it but in some ways it is really very useful it kills large numbers of mice and rats and voles which often such damage in the ﬁelds and if we could set the good which it does against the evil we should ﬁnd that the former more than makes up the latter the p oleca t this animal was formerly very common in great britain but owing to its mischievous habits it has been greatly persecuted and now it is very seldom met with it is good deal larger than the stoat being nearly two feet in length from the nose to the tip of the tail and you would think on looking at it that its fur was brown yet it scarcely has brown hair on the whole of its body the fact is that the long outer hairs are so dark to be almost black while the soft under next the skin is pale yellow and the inner coat shows through the outer one the effect is very much the same if the whole of the fur were brown the polecat is sometimes called the foumart this name is formed from the two words foul marten and has been given to the animal because it looks like marten and has most foul and disagreeable smell in its habits it is very much like the stoat it comes out chieﬂy by night and preys upon any birds or small animals which it may meet with following rabbits down their burrows tracking hares to their forms and sometimes killing nearly all the poultry geese and turkeys in farmyard early in april it makes kind of nest in deserted or in crevice among the rocks and there brings up its family of from three to eight little ones the animal called polecat in north america is the skunk of which we shall speak soon the name is particularly applied to the common skunk of the northeastern states and canada the f erret you know that the ferret is much used in hunting rabbits and rats it appears to be really variety of the polecat and is usually of yellowish white color with pink eyes but there is also brown form which is generally called the it is known only in domesticated form in some of the western united colorado found the footed ferret often called hunter because its specialty is the killing of it has not become very well known to animal students it dwells in burrows and hunts at night martens old world martens may be described large weasels that live in the trees one of them the is still found in the wilder parts of great britain although it is even scarcer perhaps than the polecat this animal is about big cat but it does not look large it really is because of the shortness of its legs in color it is rich brown above and yellowish white below while the tail is very long and is almost bushy that of squirrel martens are only found in the thickest parts of the forests and spend almost the whole of their lives in the trees running up and down the trunks and leaping from bough 94 95 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https bough with the most wonderful activity they even make nests among the branches in which to bring up their little ones weaving quantity of leaves and moss together in such way to make most cosy little nursery but it is to be feared that they are sometimes lazy animals just to save themselves trouble they will turn squirrels or woodpeckers out of their nests and take possession of them themselves martens feed on any small animals which they can ﬁnd and have more than once been known to kill lambs and even fawns when they happen to live near the sea it is said that they will visit the shore by night in order to hunt mussels the american sable or is about the size of common domestic cat and looks much like young red fox it is now rare south of northern canada the sable found in the mountainous forests of northern asia seems to be nothing more than variety of the with very long fur this fur is so much in request that the animal is greatly persecuted more than two thousand skins being sometimes taken in single season types of fur bearers weasel ermine otter wolverine glutton pine marten sable skunk badger the g lutt on or w olverene you would say that this animal hardly looks like weasel at all it is very heavily and clumsily built and including the tail is often much four feet long if you did not know what it was you might almos t take it bear cub with tail it is blackish brown in color with lighter band which runs from the shoulders along the sides and across the ﬂanks far the root of the tail glutton is rather an odd name this creature is it but certainly the animal deserves it it will go on eating and eating long after you would think that it could not possibly swallow morsel more indeed glutton has been known to devour at single meal great joint of meat which would have been more than sufﬁcient lion or tiger whole day it lives in north america and also in northern europe and northern asia and the hunters ﬁnd it terrible nuisance night after night it will 96 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https along line of traps and devour all the animals caught in them then too if they bury quantity of provisions in the ground meaning to come back and fetch them later on glutton is very likely to discover them and dig them up while the animal is also fond of visiting their huts while they are absent and stealing everything it can carry away blankets knives axes and even saucep ans and have been stolen in this way by gluttons and once one of these animals actually succeeded in dragging away and hiding gun it is even worse robber in fact than the arctic fox and it can hardly ever be trapped because it is so crafty that it almost always discovers the traps and either passes them by or pulls them to pieces while it is so wary and so swift of foot that the hunter very seldom has chance of shooting it it was formerly supposed that this animal was even more crafty still and that it would collect quantity of the moss of which deer are so fond lay it upon the ground bait and hide in the foliage of an overhanging bough so to spring down upon the animals when they stopped to feed but this story seems to be quite untrue the r atel more curious still is the ratel which belongs to the family of badgers you can not possibly mistake it if you see it all the upper part of its body is grayish white and all the lower part is black so that it looks rather like lady wearing white mantle and black skirt but if the ratel is odd in appearance it is odder still in habits if you go to look at them in zoo you are sure to ﬁnd them trotting leisurely round and round their cage in perfect circle one behind the other and when they come to certain spot they always stop turn head over heels pick themselves up and then run on again why they so nobody knows but hours every day they keep up this singular performance the ratel is very fond of honey so fond that it is often called the or and it spends good deal of time in prowling about in search of the nests of wild bees you would think that it would get badly stung by the bees would you when it tore their nests open and robbe d them of their sweet stores but its coat is so thick that the insects can scarcely force their stings through it while even if they so there is thick loose skin under it and layer of fat under that so it seems quite certain that ratel never gets stung matter how many nests he may rob the animal does not live entirely on honey however but also feeds upon rats mice small birds lizards and even insects two kinds of ratels are known one of which lives in africa and the other in india the b adger the european badger was formerly very common in great britain it was generally known the brock and when we hear of place called by such name brockley or brockenhurst we may be quite sure that it was once inhabited by great many badgers nowadays however these animals are more scarce in great britain and only to be found general thing in the wildest parts of the country and they only come out of their burrows by night very few people even see them in state of freedom but all over temperate northern europe and asia the european badger is found their burrows are generally made either in the very thickest part of dense forest or else on the side of steep cliff which is well covered with trees they run some distance into the ground and generally open out into several chambers while at the end there is always large hollow which the animals use bedroom they like to be comfortable so they always line this hollow with good thick layer of dried fern and dead leaves you would be quite astonished to ﬁnd how much of this bedding is often packed away in the burrow of single badger these animals are most cleanly in their habits and are very careful not to take any dirt into their burrows with them they have been known example to use low 97 98 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https near the entrance scraper and always to rub their feet upon it before going in and every now and then they have grand turning out all their bedding and taking in fresh supply when the badger is digging it uses its nose well its paws shoveling the earth aside with it from time to time and every now and then it walks backward to the entrance of the burrow pushing out the loosened earth in heap behind it the teeth of the european badger are made in very curious way they interlock with one another just like those of steel trap the jaws too are exceedingly strong so that the animal is able to inﬂict very severe bite but it is most peaceable creature and never attempts to attack unless it is driven to bay regards food it will eat almost anything it seems equally fond of mice frogs lizards birds eggs snails worms fruit beechnuts and roots if it ﬁnds wasps or bumblebees nest it will dig it up and devour all the grubs and the food which has been stored up them caring nothing the stings of the angry insects and very often it gathers quantity of provisions together in small chamber opening out of its burrow which it uses larder the head of the badger is white with broad black streak on either side which encloses both the eye and the ear the body is reddish gray above whitish gray on the sides and blackish brown below and the ﬂanks and tail are nearly white in length it is very nearly three feet from the muzzle to the tip of the tail the american badger living in the western parts of north america resembles its european cousin in nearly all respects differing from it chieﬂy in the form of the teeth in the habit of eating more ﬂesh and in liking open ﬂat country better than the dense forests preferred by its old world relation another difference is noted by hornaday who tells us that the american badger has savage and sullen disposition and pet is one of the worst imaginable the s kunk many of the animals of the weasel tribe have most disagreeable odor but there is none whose scent is so horribly disgusting that of the skunk this is north american animal of about the size of cat with long narrow head stoutly built body and big bushy tail in color it is black with white streak on the forehead white patch on the neck and broad stripe of the same color running along either side of the back the offensive odor of the skunk is due to liquid which is stored up in certain glands near the root of the tail this liquid can be squirted out at will to distance of twelve or ﬁfteen feet and if the animal is attacked or thinks itself in danger it does not attempt to use its teeth but just turns round raise s its tail and sends perfect shower of the vile ﬂuid over its enemy and it is almost impossible to wash the smell away drop or two once fell on the coat of dog the animal was washed over and over again most thoroughly with various kinds of soap yet week later when he happened to rub himself against one of the legs of table one could bear to sit by it afterward the skunk seems to know perfectly well how offensive its odor is and never runs away if it meets man or even large dog it just stands perfectly quiet like cat expecting to be stroked ready to make use of its ﬂuid if necessary this singular animal lives in holes in the ground making warm little nest at the end in which to bring up its young it feeds upon small animals small birds and their eggs frogs lizards and most of all upon insects otters last among the members of the weasel tribe come the otters these animals are specially formed living in the water the paws example are very large and broad and the toes are fastened together by means of kind of web like that on the foot of swan or duck so that they form very useful paddles then the body is long lithe and 99 100 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https and the tail is so broad and ﬂat that it serves capital rudder and enables the animal to direct its course the fur too consists of two coats of hair instead of only one the outer which is composed of long stiff bristles lying upon the inner like very close thatch and quite preventing water from passing through so although an otter is dripping from head to foot when it comes out of the water it never gets really wet the animal is wonderfully active in the water and can easily overtake and captu re the swiftest of ﬁshes sometimes it is very destructive when ﬁshes are plentiful it becomes so dainty that it never eats its victims but just takes bite or two from the best part of the ﬂesh at the back of the neck and then leaves the rest of the body lying upon the ground so ﬁshermen are not at all fond of it and kill it whenever they can but sometimes when the rivers are very low or when the surface of the water is thickly covered with ice the otters ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to obtain sufﬁcient supply of food so they leave the streams and wander far inland sometimes making their way into the farmyards and feasting upon poultry or even upon young pigs and lambs but they only this when they are in real danger of starvation and always return to the soon they can the home of the otter is generally situated beneath the spreading roots of large tree on the bank of stream the animal does not dig burrow if it can help it but prefers to take advantage of some natural cleft in the ground at the end of which it makes nest of ﬂags and rushes in this nest from three to ﬁve little ones are brought up and if you were to lie very quietly on the bank some little time early on warm spring morning you would very likely see the mother otter playing with her little ones or teaching them how to swim and to catch ﬁsh the bite of the otter is very severe and it is almost impossible to force the animal to loose its hold in india there is kind of otter which is often trained to catch ﬁsh its master it is taught ﬁrst of all to pursue an imitation ﬁsh it is drawn through the water by string and to bring it ashore and lay it down upon the ground then dead ﬁsh is substituted the false one and when the otter has learned to bring this to its owner and to give it up at the word of command it is sent in pursuit of live ﬁsh fastened to line and before very long it learns its duties so thorough ly that it will catch ﬁsh after ﬁsh and bring them back without attempting to eat them just retriever dog will bring back the birds or the rabbits which its master has shot the otter of north america is still found but not numerously in the carolinas and florida in some rocky mountain districts in british columbia and alaska and in the canadian provinces there is also kind of otter which lives in the sea and is called the it is also known the kalan it is found on the coasts of the northern paciﬁc and is much larger than the common otter often weighing much seventy or eighty pounds and being nearly four feet in total length its fur is the most costly known ﬁne pelt being worth 600 or 800 before dressing this high price is due partly to the beauty of the fur but mainly to its rarity chapter xi the bear tribe the bears are very interesting animals in animals perhaps are young folks more interested than in these they have many traits that endear them to little human admirers while with older persons they have often lived on terms of intimate friendship in our own country this interest in these fascinating animals was lately quickened 101 102 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https especially by the almost universal possession and popularity among them of teddy bears so named with playfu l reference to president theodore roosevelt affectionately called teddy and himself well acquainted with bears and other beasts both wild and tame polar b ears one of the most interesting of all bears is the polar bear which is found in almost all parts of the arctic regions sometimes it is called the white bear on account of the color of its coat but this is very seldom really white generally it is creamy yellow and sometimes in an old male it is dingy yellow and not even of the color of cream this is one of the largest of the bears it often grows to length of nine feet and weighs eight hundred or even nine hundred pounds yet it is wonderfully active and it can run with very great speed indeed if it were to pursue man he would have very little chance of escape but it is not at all quarrelsome animal and although it will ﬁght most savagely if it is wounded or driven to bay using both teeth and claws with terrible effect it very seldom attacks if it is not molested one of the ﬁrst things that we notice on looking at polar bear is the small size of its head and the length of its neck this doubt is to help it in swimming if it had head big that of an ordinary bear it would ﬁnd it very much harder to force its way through the water and of course it must be able to swim well otherwise it could never catch the porpoises and ﬁshes upon which it feeds we notice too the huge size of its paws which are nearly eighteen inches long and very broad well these form most excellent paddles while the thick fur is so oily that it quite prevents the icy water from coming into contact with the skin the bear is very fond of feeding upon seals well upon porpoises and ﬁshes but these are so active in the water that it seldom attempts to chase them preferring to creep quietly up to them they lie sleeping on the ice then it kills them with one stroke of its terrible paw sometimes too it is said to prey upon the walrus crushing in its skull by series of tremendous blows before it can shufﬂe of f the ice into the sea the feet of the polar bear are specially suited traveling over the ice the soles are covered with long thick hairs which give it ﬁrm foothold and at the same time prevent it from feeling the cold of the frozen surface the young of these bears are born and brought up in kind of nursery under the snow which is so warm and snug that they not feel the cold at all here they live with their mother until the snow melts at the return of warmer weather and then some months father mother and cubs all wander about together polar bears sometimes live very long time in captivity one of these animals lived in the london zoo years and another the former of these once gave the keepers terrible fright early one morning he managed to climb out of his enclosure and when they found him he was just setting off on journey of discovery into the regent park after good deal of trouble they got him back and altered his enclosure in such way that he could never make his escape again the b rown b ear of urope and sia this bear is found in most parts of europe and also throughout almost the whole of asia north of the himalayas in former days it was not uncommon even in england and in the time of edward the confessor the city of norwich was obliged to kill bear every year and send its body to the king these bears are found in wooded hilly districts often ascending to considerable heights in the mountains in some parts of asia they make regular tracks through the forest in the form of pathways about two feet wide and it is said that these tracks sometimes run hundreds of miles they are solitary animals and it is not often that even pair are seen together but several months after they are born the cubs go about with their mother 103 104 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https bear is generally supposed when it ﬁghts to try to hug its enemies to death throwing its fore limbs round them and crushing them in its embrace but in reality it strikes kind of side blow and forces its great claws into its victim body thus causing terrible wound just before it strikes it rears its body erect and sits moment almost perfectly still and it is this moment that an experienced hunter waits in order to send bullet through its heart the brown bear of europe and asia can scarcely be called beast of prey though now and then when it is very hungry it will kill pony or sheep and feast upon its ﬂesh it eats roots rule digging them up with its great paws and it is also very fond of fruit it will rob the nests of wild bees too and feed greedily upon the honey appearing to pay attention to the stings of the angry insects and sometimes it may be seen turning over large stones in order to catch and eat the beetles earwigs centipedes which have been hiding beneath it now and then too these bears have been known to catch ﬁsh their usual plan seems to be to wade out into stream in some place where the water is not more than about eighteen inches deep and there to stand motionless until ﬁsh comes swimming past then with one quick sudden stroke the victim is killed and the bear seizes it in its mouth and carries it to the bank to be devoured when bears catch ﬁsh in this way they are usually rather dainty and only eat the best part of the ﬂesh upon the back in cold countries these bears often hibernate during the winter just bats and hedgehogs they eat great deal of food toward the end of summer and become exceedingly fat and then retire to hollow trees or caves and fall asleep several months during which they live on their own fat in the spring of course when they wake up they are very thin but few weeks of good feeding will bring them back into proper condition these brown bears are very easily tamed and many performing bears belong to this species it is not nearly such large animal the polar bear its average length being only about six feet the merican b rown b ear the brown bear of america is closely allied to that of the old world it was ﬁrst described by sir john richardson who called it the barrenlands bear it has since been further described by clinton hart merriam chief of the united states biological survey it differs from the grizzly in the smallness of its claws the difference in the proﬁle also is very brown bear having proﬁle like that of the european and asiatic bear while that of the grizzly is ﬂat the brown bear of north america lives largely on the fruits and berries of the northern plants on dead deer and on putrid ﬁsh of which quantities are left on the banks of the northern rivers whether the large brown bear of the rocky mountains is always grizzly or often this less dangerous race is doubtful the following is sir samuel baker account of these bears he says when i was in california experienced informants told that true grizzly bear was to be found east of the paciﬁc slope there are numerous bears of three if not four kinds in the rocky mountains these are frequentl y termed grizzlies but it is misnomer the true grizzly is far superior in size but of similar habits there are certainly three rocky mountain grizzly the brown and the small black bear there is probably also cross between the black and the brown it is mistake to say that the brown bears which come to eat the refuse on the of the hotels of the yellowstone park and let ladies photograph them are savage grizzly bears the g rizzl y b ear the famous grizzly bear which lives in north america is much bigger and stronger and more savage than the brown bears so that it is really very formidable animal when 105 106 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https grown this huge creature is sometimes much nine feet long from the tip of the snout to the root of the tail while it weighs at least 800 or 900 pounds the grizzly is very distinct race of brown bear it has ﬂat proﬁle like the polar bear this enormous creature is barely able to climb trees and has the largest claws of have been known to measur ﬁve inches along the curve the true grizzly which used to be found far north latitude and south far mexico is rare animal now its turn made the ranchmen poison it and rendered the task an easy one it is now only found in the northern rocky mountains and parts of northern california and nevada formerly encounters with old ephraim the trappers called this bear were numerous and deadly it attacked men if attacked by them and often without provocation the horse perhaps more than its rider was the object of the bear on ranch near the upper waters of the colorado river several colts were taken by grizzly bears one of them was found buried according to the custom of this bear and the owner sat up to shoot the animal having only the riﬂe of the day excellent shooting deer or indians but useless against so massive beast this bear unless hit in the head or heart he only wounded it the bear rushed in struck him blow with its paw the paw measures foot across smashed the riﬂe which he held up protection and struck the barrel on to his head the man fell insensible when the bear having satisﬁed himself that he was dead picked him up carried him off and buried him in another hole which it scratched near the dead colt it then dug up the colt and ate part of it and went off some time later the man came to his senses and awoke to ﬁnd himself dead and buried the earth was only roughly thrown over him he scrambled out and saw close by the remains of the colt thinking that it might be about the bear dinner and remembering that he was probably put by in the larder the next meal he hurried home at once and did not trouble the bear again not so siberian peasant who had much the same adventure he had been laughed at wishing to shoot bear and went out in the woods to so the bear had the best of it knocked him down and so frightfully mangled his arm that he fainted bruin then buried him in orthodox bear fashion and the man when he came to which he fortunately did before the bear came back got up and made his way to the village there he was long time ill and all through his sickness and delirium talked of nothing but shooting the bear when he got well he disappea red into the forest with his gun and after short absence returned with the bear skin the b lack b ear the black bear is also an inhabitant of north america but is neither so common or so widely distributed it used to be there are two reasons this the ﬁrst is that this bear is an extremely mischievous anim al and is very fond of visiting farmyards and carrying off sheep calves pigs and poultry so the farmer loses opportunity of shooting or trapping it and the other reason is that its coat is very valuable so that the hunters follow it even into the wilder parts of the country where settlers yet have not made their appearance this animal is only about half big the grizzly bear it seldom exceeds ﬁve feet in total length it never attacks man unless it is provoked when driven to bay however it becomes most formidable opponent dealing terriﬁc blows with its fore paws and ﬁghting on with furious ener gy even after it has received mortal wound early in the autumn the black bear generally goes into winter quarters finding hollow under fallen tree or cave of suitable size it gathers together about cartload of dead leaves and ferns and makes snug cosy nest very often it lays number of branches on the top to prevent the leaves from blowing away before very long of course this nest is deeply covered with snow and the bear lies fast asleep inside it four or ﬁve months living on the fat which it stored up inside its body during the summer this bear is sometimes known the musquaw an indian name 107 108 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https ears these animals are so called because they wander about by day and like to bask in the hottest sunshine instead of hiding away in some dark retreat most of the other bears they live in india and the larger islands of the malay archipelago they are excellent climbers spending great part of their lives among the branches of the trees these bears have most curious tongues which are very long and slender and can be coiled and twisted about in the most singular way apparently they are used licking out honey from the nests of wild bees are small gentle creatures and are easily tamed in the zoo they are extremely playful and you may often see them standing upon their hind legs and wrestling with one another and then tumbling over and rolling upon the ﬂoor evidently enjoying themselves very much their fur is smooth and glossy and is in color the chin and patch under the throat being white the s loth ear another name this bear is the name it is perhaps the oddest of all the bears it has very long and shaggy hair ﬂexible snout which it is always curling and twisting and very awkwardly and clumsily built body it walks with curious rolling gait crossing its paws over one another at every step it takes and it has queer way of eating termites and ants by breaking open their nests with its great fore paws blowing away the dust and ﬁne earth and then sucking up the insects by forcibly drawing in its breath through its lips it makes such noise when doing this that it can be heard from distance of two or three hundred yards the is seldom seen abroad during the daytime the odd reason that the skin of the soles of its feet is so delicate that it can not bear to walk upon ground which is heated by the rays of the sun sometimes when hunter has driven one of them from its lair and pursued it by day he has found its feet most terribly scorched and blistered when at last he killed it simply because it had been obliged to walk over rocks on which the midday sun was beating down when mother has little ones she always carries them about on her back if she stops to feed they at once jump down but always spring up again soon she moves on even when they are quite big they travel about in this way and may often be seen with cub large retriever dog perched upon her back and another one trotting along by her side and from time to time she makes the little ones change places if mother is wounded while her cubs are with her she always seems to think that one of them must have bitten her and immediately gives them both good sound box on the ears if several of these animals are together and one of them is struck by bullet it begins to howl and cry at the top of its voice the other bears at once come running up to see what is the matter and begin to howl and cry too out of pure sympath y its sufferings then the wounded animal thinks that they have caused his injuries and begins to cuff them with his paws they of course strike back and very soon all the bears are buffeting and biting and scratching one another they must be very stupid creatures must they the is little more than ﬁve feet long when fully grown and stands from to inches in height at the shoulder in color it is black with white mark on the upper part of its chest like that of the the p anda besides the true bears there are number of smaller animals which belong to the same tribe one of these is the panda wah or which is only about big rather large cat it is rusty red in color with darker rings upon the tail the tip of which is black the face is white and the lower parts of the body are very dark brown 109 110 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https panda is found in the forests of the eastern himalayas and also in eastern tibet it is very good climber and spends much of its time in the trees searching the nuts fruits and acorns on which it feeds if it happens to ﬁnd bird nest with eggs in it it will suck them all one after the other and sometimes it will come down to the ground to make meal upon roots or the young shoots of bamboo the panda has rather large like those of one would think that they would form very serviceable weapo ns but the animal seems to have very little idea of ﬁghting and scarcely tries even to defend itself if it is attacked racoons next come the racoons which live in america the best known of them is the common racoon found throughout the united states and also in central amer ica far south costa rica this is very pretty animal in size it is about big rather large cat and is brown or grayish brown in color with tail that is very bushy and beautifully ringed with gray and black the head is rather like that of fox with whitish forehead and black patch just below it enclosing the eyes racoons may usually be seen in zoo and if you give one of them piece of bread or biscuit it will take it in its fore paws just if the animal were monkey and then go and rinse it carefully in the little pond in the middle of its cage it never eats scrap of food without washing it in this curious manner and this reason the germans have given it the name of w aschbär or the fur of the racoon is so soft and thick that it is very valuable and the animal is very much hunted it is generally hunted by night the hunters going out with number of dogs which soon drive the animal into tree they then sit in circle round the trunk while one of the hunters climbs the tree drives the racoon to the end of the branch and then shakes it violently till the poor creature falls to the ground where it is quickly seized and despatched racoons will eat almost anything some times they will visit and kill number of the fowls by biting off their heads or they will go down to the when the tide is out to search crabs and oysters or to the creeks and streams to hunt crayﬁsh they are fond too of mice and young birds and eggs and lizards and water tortoises and even insects occasionally they make meal on nuts or fruit but although they are such capital climbers and can run about among the actively squirrels they never appear to pluck fruits or nuts they grow but only to pick up those which have fallen on the ground in northern mexico and adjoining parts of the united states there is small relative of the racoon called cacomistle or american though it is not real civet this has sharp face big erect ears body and long furry ringed tail and it makes gentle and most amusing pet of great service in keeping house free from vermin hence it is often tamed and kept by miners and others who are glad of its lively company and need assistance in housekeeping the c oati closely allied to the racoons is the coati or which you may recognize at once by its very long snout this snout is turned up at the tip and gives to the animal most curious appearance while it is continually being curled and twisted about like that of the it is chieﬂy used rooting about in the ground in search of worms and insects and when the animal is drinking it always turns up the tip of its snout far possible in order that it may not get wet the coati can climb quite well the racoons and spends most of its life in the trees seldom coming down to the ground except to feed or to drink it has queer way of descending tree with its head downward turning the hinder feet around in such way that it can hook its claws into the little crevices in the bark during the daytime it is generally fast asleep using its long bushy tail partly pillow and partly blanket 111 112 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https almost immediately after sunset it wakes up and begins to scamper about among the branches with the most wonderful activity stopping every now and then to rob bird nest or to poke its snout into hole in search of insects the coati is about yard in length nearly half of which belongs to the tail in color it is chestnut brown with black ears and legs while the tail has black and browni sh yellow rings the k inkajou only one more member of the bear tribe remains to be mentioned and that is the very curious kinkajou which is found in the forests of south and central america it is about big cat with very woolly fur of light brown color and very long tail this tail is prehensile like that of spider and the animal never seems quite happy unless the tip is coiled round branch and if you make pet of it and carry it about in your arms it will always try to coil its tail round one of your wrists it has very odd tongue too so round and long that it looks almost like worm the animal can poke this tongue into the cells of honeycomb in order to lick out the honey or use it in plucking fruit which would otherwise be out of its reach and it descends the trunks of trees head ﬁrst just the coati does chapter xii the seal tribe we now come to group of carnivorou s or mammals which live in the seals people sometimes think that these creatu res are ﬁshes but that is quite mistake their blood is hot our own and they breathe by means of nostrils and lungs just we and not by means of gills like the ﬁshes then they have not ﬁns to keep their bodies upright in the water ﬁshes have neither they swim by means of their tails and their bodies are covered with fur not with scales how s eals s wim so you see seals are very different from ﬁshes although they spend almost the whole of their lives in the water but nature has formed them in such way that they can swim and dive quite well the ﬁshes can yet it is difﬁcult to see how they so if you watch tame seal swimming about in large tank of water you will see that it glides smoothly and swiftly and easily and gracefully along rising and diving and turning with the most perfect ease but how it swims you will not be able to tell at all you know however that you can row boat by means of single oar if you work it from side to side at the stern you will not travel very fast partly because the oar is not very big and partly because you are not very strong but still the boat will move now if you look at the hinder feet of seal you will see that they are very broad that they are set far back upon the body and that if necessary they can be placed side by side together then think of the body of the seal live boat and of these great broad feet an oar worked from the stern and you will be able to understand how the animal swims it just places these feet side by side and uses them in such way that they act upon the water exactly an oar does while their strength is so great that they drive the body along very swiftly how t hey are k ept w arm 113 114 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https if the seal is animal how can it remain in the sea days together without being chilled if we go to the seaside and wish to bathe we are advised not to stay in the water more than ten or ﬁfteen minutes and if we were to so we might be made seriously yet the seal can live days or even weeks in the icy seas of the far north and yet never seem to suf fer from the cold at all how is this well the fact is that ﬁrst of all nature has supplied the seal with kind of mackintosh to keep it dry this mackintosh in most seals is made of double coat of fur first there is an outer layer of long stout hairs almost like bristles and underneath there is generally another layer of soft close which you see in lady sealskin jacket and in order to keep the water from passing through it this double coat of fur is kept constantly oiled all over the surface of seal skin are thousands upon thousands of little holes each of which opens into tiny bag of oil and this oil is constantly oozing out on to the fur so you see the furry coat really does act like mackintosh it quite prevents the seal from ever getting wet when an animal lives in water which is often covered with ice however something more than mackintosh is necessary in order to keep it warm so under the mackintosh nature has provided the seal with thick greatcoat and this greatcoat is made of substance much warmer than cloth or even than fur it is made of fat just under the skin covering the whole of the body is layer of fat two or three inches thick and this keeps the seal so warm that even when it is lying upon ice it never gets chilled in the least fully f itted i ts h ome the nostrils and the ears of the seal are made in such way that water can not enter them when the animal is diving they are furnished with little valves which are so arranged that they close soon the water presses upon them and the greater the pressure the more tightly they shut up so that not the tiniest drop of water can ever enter them there is still one more way in which the animal is specially ﬁtted its life in the water it has to feed on ﬁshes and ﬁshes are very slippery creatures if you have ever tried to hold live ﬁsh in your hand you will know that it is difﬁcult thing to the ﬁsh just gives wriggle and twist and slips out of your grasp if it had been oiled so that it would seem quite impossible the seal to hold its ﬁnny victims even if it overtook and seized them but when we come to look at its teeth we ﬁnd that those which we call molars or grinders are set with long sharp points so that when ﬁsh is seized they enter its body and hold it in grip from which there is escape the c ommon s eal there are many different kinds of seals but we shall only be able to tell you about four or ﬁve of the best known the ﬁrst of these is the common seal it is found on both sides of the atlantic ocean and in the north paciﬁc on some coasts it is much disliked by ﬁshermen owing to the great number of ﬁshes which it devours it is so cunning that it will even ﬁnd its way in among the nets they have let down feast heartily upon the captive ﬁsh and then quietly swim out again often doing the same thing day after day weeks together and it is almost impossible to destroy it it seems to know perfectly well when its enemies are on the watch and will only expose its nostrils above the water when it comes up to the surface to breathe very often ﬁshermen consider it unlucky to kill seal so that the animal is able to carry on its robberies without being interfered with the common seal when fully grown is about ﬁve feet long and is yellowish gray in color with number of darker spots sprinkled over the body and sides it is very active in the sea and fairly active on land although it can not walk it will shufﬂe along over the beach at wonderful pace such an animal it does so it throws up perfect shower of stones with its hinder nippers and those who have chased it have often thought that it was doing so on purpose and was actually throwing stones at them 115 116 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https this seal is caught when quite young and treated kindly it soon becomes exceedingly tame it has even been known to live indoors like dog or cat and to lie hours together basking in front of the ﬁre and in more than one case when its owner wished to get rid of it and put it back into the sea it swam after him crying so pitifully he rowed away that he could not bear to leave it and took it home with him again after all ions the are so called because they are supposed to look very much like lions but it is not easy to see the resemblance sometimes they are called because there is soft woolly under beneath the coating of thick bristles there is in most of the animals belonging to this family there are nearly always to be seen in zoos and they are so intelligen t and clever that the keepers are able to teach them to perform many tricks wooden platform is built them with the upper end standing some feet above the surface of the water and they are very fond of shufﬂing up this lying at the end until number of visitors have come close to the railings to look at them and then diving into the water with great splash so to send shower of spray over the spectators there are several different kinds of these animals of which the patagonian is perhaps the most numerous it is found on both the atlantic and the paciﬁc coasts of south america and is rather more than its relations since it has crest of long hairs on the back of its neck which really looks something like mane but you can not see this crest when the animal is wet it then lies down ﬂat upon the skin the color of the fur varies much the old males are brown the females are gray and the young ones are rich chocolate which begins to grow paler when they are almost twelve months old the california is distinct species of the paciﬁc coast and is found from there to japan on the rocks off san francisco is one of its ancient rookeries and the animal is there preserved by the government one of the sights of the bay in traveling menageries and in zoos you may hear the california loudly and continually barking that lived good many years in the london zoo was exceedingly clever it would climb up and down ladder with either its head or its tail ﬁrst ﬁre off gun kiss its keeper and catch ﬁshes in its mouth if they were thrown to it just dog will catch piece of biscuit cleverer still however were party of established at the london hippodrome in 1902 they would play kind of football with their heads catching the ball and passing it from one to another in most wonderful way and scarcely ever missing it or making mistake they would take part too in musical performance one playing the drum another cymbals third the horn and fourth the bells while their trainer stood in the middle and beat time and one of them would actually balance an upright pole with ﬁsh on the top on the tip of its nose waddle across the stage still holding the pole upright and then suddenly jerk the pole aside and catch the ﬁsh in its mouth it fell but are rather expensive pets to keep they have such very large appetites single will eat about pounds of ﬁsh in single day and when one remembers that these seals are sometimes found in herds of hundreds of thousands one would almost think that they must very soon devour all the ﬁshes in the sea when fully grown the male of the largest species of is often ten feet long and weighs thousand pounds eals the are sometimes known although they are not even much like bears the are like lions they are destroyed in very great numbers the sake of their skins which have thick coating of soft fur under the stiff outer bristles 117 118 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https bristles of course have to be removed before the fur can be used and this is done by shaving the inner surface of the skin away until their roots are cut off they can then be pulled out without any difﬁculty while the roots of the under which are not nearly so deeply buried are not hurt in the least but the operation is not at all an easy one and can only be performed by highly skilled workman and that is one reason why sealskin jackets are so expensive another reason is that in almost every skin there are number of ﬂaws all of which have to be most carefully cut out after which the holes have to be ﬁlled up in such way to leave traces of the operation then the fur has to be cleaned combed and prepared and dyed so that the garments which are made from it really can not be sold except at very high price these seals are not hunted in the sea they are such good swimmers that it would be very difﬁcult to kill them so during the greater part of the year they are allowed to live in peace but during the they live on land lying upon certain parts of the coast in enormous herds and the visit these places drive the young males to distance from the rest and there kill them by striking them on the head with heavy club such vast numbers of were destroyed in this way that at last it became necessary to protect them fear lest they should be entirely killed off so only certain number may now be killed in each year the best known of the is the northern which is found on both shores of the northern paciﬁc it used to visit the pribilof islands in enormous numbers during the but lately so many have been killed despite protective laws that now the herds are quite small the h ooded s eal another seal whose fur is very valuable is called the hooded seal or crested seal because the adult male has singular growth upon the front part of the head this hood or crest consists of kind of bag of skin which lies just above the nose and can be inﬂated with air at will what its use may be in state of nature is not known but when the seal is hunted it is often of the greatest service the force of blow which would otherwise have caused instant death is so broken by the crest that the animal is merely stunned few moments and is able to slip into the water before the hunter returns to take off its skin this seal is rather formidable animal when it is enraged it is quite large when fully grown and uses both its claws and its teeth in ﬁghting the male animals are very quarrelsome among themselves and most desperate battles take place these and other lie in summer upon ﬂoating where their young are born steamers ﬁlled with men ﬁnd them off the coast of labrador land on the ice and kill thousands the sake of their skins and the oil tried out of the blubber or underlying fat the s ea lephant one of the biggest of all the seals is the great also called which frequents the shores of many of the islands in the antarctic ocean it owes its name partly to its enormous size the old males sometimes reaching length of eighteen or even twenty feet and partly to its very curious trunk which is sometimes much foot long in the females and the young animals this trunk is wanting and even in the male it is seldom seen unless the anima l is excited when it can be blown out very much like the bag of the hooded seal the fur of the is much too coarse to be of any great value but its skin can be made into excellent leather while the thick coat of blubber which lies beneath it furnishes large quantities of useful oil the consequence is that the animal has been much hunted and is now comparatively scarce even in districts where it was once very common it is not nearly so ﬁerce the hooded seal and almost always takes to ﬂight if 119 120 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https is attacked its huge body quivering like vast mass of jelly it shufﬂes awkwardly along over the beach but the males ﬁght most ﬁercely with one another inﬂicting really terrible wounds by means of their teeth the w alrus the strangest of all the seals is the walrus whose tusks representing the canine teeth are sometimes much two feet long this animal is found only in the norther n parts of the atlantic and paciﬁc ocean s and is not often seen outside the arctic circle formerly it was far more widely distributed and in the atlantic was even seen frequently far south the gulf of lawrence but it has been so persecuted by hunters that it has quite disappeared from many districts where once it was in great numbers the walrus is not quite so large the nevertheless it is very big animal male will often measure twelve feet in length and will weigh nearly ton it uses its tusks many different purposes when it wants to climb upon an example it will dig them deeply into the ice and so obtain purchase while it raises its huge body out of the water they are very formidable weapons too and the animal can strike so quickly with them both sideways and downward that it is not at all easy to avoid their stroke then they are very useful in obtaining food if walrus ﬁnds the body of dead whale it will cut off huge lumps of the ﬂesh by means of its tusks and very often it will dig in the sandy mud with them mussels and cockles the consequence is that the tusks are frequently broken while they are nearly always very much worn at the tips the name walrus is corruption of the animal is sometimes known the and also the morse chapter xiii the whale tribe the whales are more thoroughly creatures of the water than even the seals they never come upon dry land at all even during the indeed if whale is unfortunate enough to be thrown upon the shore by great wave and left stranded it can not possibly make its way back into the sea but is obliged to lie there till it dies yet we must not think that these giant creatures are ﬁshes they are truly mammals the seals are their blood is hot and is driven through the body by heart made up of four chambers instead of only two they breathe by means of nostrils and lungs and not by means of gills and besides that they suckle their young just all other mammals then once more if you look at the body of whale you will see that its tail is quite different from that of ﬁsh the tail of ﬁsh is upright but that of whale is set crosswise so that there is only one respect in which whales are really like ﬁshes and that is the general shape of the body these huge animals fall naturally into two families the ﬁrst consisting of those which have teeth and the other of those which have whalebone or baleen instead but in many ways the members of both these families are alike how w hales b rea the all whales example breathe in very curious way doubt you have heard of the spouting of these animals and perhaps you may have seen picture of whale 121 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https on the surface of the sea and throwing up great column of water from its nostrils or these pictures however are rather exaggerated what really happens is this whale of course you know often remains under water very long time and when at last it rises to the surface the air in its lungs is heavily laden with moisture when the air is dischar ged through the into the cold atmosphere the moisture condenses at once into kind of misty spray just that in our own breath does in very cold weather this is what one sees when whale is spouting although the animal sometimes begins to blow while its nostrils are still beneath the surface smal l quantity of may perhaps be thrown up too whale if it is not disturbed will often blow ﬁfty or sixty times in succession let us try to explain why it does so if you try to hold your breath you will ﬁnd that it is very difﬁcult to so more than of minute but if before you make the attempt you get rid of much of the air in your lungs you possibly can draw in very deep breath and get rid of that and then repeat the process about half dozen times you will ﬁnd that you can hold your breath quite easily at least minute and half the reason is that by breathing so often and so deeply you have puriﬁed all the blood in your body instead of having usual very large quantity which has done its work and requires to be refreshed in the lungs before it can be of any further use now the whale spouts ﬁfty or sixty times in succession just the same reason it is taking series of deep breaths so that it may purify all the blood in its body and be able to remain under water long time possible without having to rise to the surface air and besides this there is most wonderful arrangement in its body which enables it to stay below very much longer than would otherwise be possible inside its chest it has sort of so to speak consisting of number of large vessels which contain great quantity of extra blood besides that which is circulating through the body this blood also is puriﬁed when the whale spouts then when the animal has remained under water some little time and begins to feel the want of air it does not rise to the surface at once in order to breathe but just pumps some of the extra blood from this curious cistern into its veins and arteries to take the place of that which is used up and requires to be puriﬁed this it can over and over again until all the extra supply is used up too when it is obliged to rise and spout general rule whale spends from ten to twelve minutes in spouting and can then remain under water if necessary considerably more than an hour it is owing to this singular method of breathing that whales can be so easily killed the object of the hunters is simply to drive them below before they have ﬁnished spouting they this again and again and the consequence is that the poor animal soon becomes completely exhausted and falls an easy prey the w hale s b lubber you remember you how the seals are protected from cold partly by their thick and oily fur and partly by the layer of fat which lies just under the skin well the whales are protected in much the same way they have fur of course but the layer of fat which we call blubber is always several inches in thickness and is sometimes much two feet so that the whale is never chilled by living in the water even when it has to make its way through ﬂoating ice this blubber has another use well when the whale dives to great sometimes it sinks half mile or more beneath the surface of the pressure on its body becomes enormously great because of the weight of the water above it if you were to dive to half that depth you would die but the blubber of the whale is so elastic that it resists the pressure just great thick sheet of would so that the animal does not suf fer from it in the least mistakes of rtists 122 123 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https you see pictures in which whales are drawn with very big eyes very long ears and perhaps even with their tongues hanging out of their mouths now such pictures are drawn by artists who know nothing about whales the eyes of these animals are quite small their outward ears are merely little holes in the skin closing by means of valves like those of the seals and the tongue can not be poked out of the mouth at all now let us learn something about the dif ferent kinds of whales toothed w hales first come the toothed whales or denticetes an example of these we will take the famous sperm or spermaceti whale which is also known the cachalot this whale has nearly all its teeth in the lower jaw the upper one only having very short row of small teeth on either side the lower teeth are ﬁve or six inches long and ﬁt into pits in the upper jaw when the mouth is closed these teeth are composed of beautiful ivory and were formerly valued so highly by the natives of the south sea islands that more than once tribe has actually gone to war with another tribe simply to obtain possession of single whale tooth now that it has been hunted so much apparently the does not grow to so great size it did in days gone by yet it is very big animal male will attain to length of sixty or even seventy feet while even baby whale is from eleven to fourteen feet long or big big walrus and strange to say the head is almost large the body and tail put together this is chieﬂy due to the fact that there is great cavity in the skull which contains the valuable substance we call spermaceti when one of these whales is killed the head is cut off and kind of well is dug in the forehead from which the spermaceti is drawn to the surface in buckets much thirty barrels being sometimes taken from single animal besides this the blubber yields large quantity of very valuable oil which burns with much clearer and stronger light than ordinary and sometimes curious substance called amber gris is found in its body it is used in making certain kinds of scent and is quite costly although much ﬁfty pounds of it have sometimes been taken from single whale are generally seen in companies which are known schools in olden days there were sometimes many two hundred whales in one of these schools but so many of the great creatures have been killed by whalers that it is now quite the exception to see more than four or ﬁve together these whales are very playful creature s and may often be seen gamboling on the surface of the sea and now and then breaching or leaping completely out of the water and falling back again with tremendous splash they feed chieﬂy upon the great cuttles or squids which are so plentiful in some parts of the ocean but also devour large numbers of cod and other ﬁshes but how they manage to catch these ﬁshes nobody quite seems to know these whales were formerly hunted by means of small boat in the bow of which stood man with long spear or harpoon in his hand attached to an enormo us coil of rope soon this was hurled at whale the boat was backed so to escape the stroke of its tail and the whale would then sound or dive to the depth of perhaps quarters of mile soon he rose he was driven down again already described before he had had time to ﬁnish spouting and at last when quite exhausted was killed by means of very long and lance nowadays however the harpoon is generally ﬁred from ship by means of gun and charge of is placed in the harpoon head which explodes soon the weapon enters the body of the whale such severe wound is caused that the animal very soon dies bottle nosed w hales these whales are so called because their muzzles are produced into beaks shaped somewhat like bottles although they belong to the toothed whales they only have two 124 125 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https in the lower jaw and even these are so small that they are completely buried in the gum by the side of the cachalot the whale seems quite small animal even the male seldom exceeds thirty feet in length while the female is quite six feet shorter it yields on an average about two hundredweight of spermaceti and two tons of oil its color strange to say is continually changing all through its life the young animals are black above and the older ones brown which grows lighter and lighter time goes on till at last it becomes almost yellow these whales seem to be very sympathetic creatures if one of them is wounded its companions generally swim round and round it and will even allow themselves to be killed one after the other rather than take to ﬂight but they are also rather stupid animals if they happen to ﬁnd themselves near the coast they seldom seem to realize that they can easily escape by turning round and swimming out to sea but leap and tumble about in state of great terror till at last big wave comes and throws them up on the beach whalebone hales the members of the other great group of these animals are called because they have whalebone in their mouths instead of teeth of course this substance is not really bone at all it consists of kind of horny material which grows all round the upper jaw in series of ﬂattened plates which are usually very long and hang downward from the edge of the palate each of these plates at the tip is broken up into sort of fringe so that when the jaws are partly closed there is kind of sieve or strainer between them through which everything must pass that goes in or out of the mouth this sieve is used in feeding it seems strange that an animal so huge whale should feed on some of the smallest creatures which live in the sea yet such is the case the throats of the are so narrow that one of them would almost certainly be choked if it tried to swallow herring so these whales live upon very small jelly ﬁshes and the young of shrimps prawns tiny crabs which often swim about in such vast shoals that miles and miles the sea is quite alive with them when the whale meets with one of these shoals it opens its mouth wide and swims through it then it partly closes its mouth and squirts out the water which it has taken in through the whalebone strainer the little animals of course remaining behind these are then swallowed few thousand at gulp and the whale opens its mouth and repeats the operation over and over again until its enormous appetite is satisﬁed most of the whalebone which we use is obtained from the bowhead or greenland whale which is found in the northern seas this animal is from forty to sixty feet long when fully grown and the baleen plates are often ten or even twelve feet in length while there are nearly four hundred of them on each side of the upper jaw in large whale these plates weigh more than ton and are worth at least then from 130 to 150 barrels of oil will be obtained from its blubber so that big greenland whale is very valuable animal but whales of this size are now very rarely met with and there seems to be some danger that before many years have passed away these giant creatures will be almost extinct rorquals the rorquals are sometimes known or ﬁnbacks because they have an upright ﬁn on the hinder part of the back they are not so valuable the greenland whale because their baleen is of inferior quality and is very much shorter while their blubber does not yield nearly so much oil and they can swim with such speed that they are very much harder to catch the common rorqual grows to length of about sixty or feet and is found throughout all the northern seas and occasionally even in the mediterranean it is solitary animal rule but schools of from ten to ﬁfteen individuals are sometimes met 126 127 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https and may be seen leaping into the air and rolling and tumbling about in the water though they were having game of play together the rorqual feeds partly upon the small creatures which it captures by means of its whalebone strainer and partly upon ﬁshes how vast its appetite is you can judge from the fact that many six hundred large codﬁsh have been found in the stomach of one of these animals together with number of pilchards sometimes rorqual will come quite near the coast and remain in weeks together and it swallows several boatloads of ﬁsh every day it is scarcely necessary to say that the ﬁshermen are not at all pleased to see it there is another kind of whale called the lesser rorqual which only grows to the length of about or thirty feet it is common off the shores of norway and commoner still in north american waters where it is known the ﬁnner it is very playful animal and is said sometimes to gambol round and round ship miles now and then diving underneath it on one side and coming up on the other types of bears polar or ice bear american black bear brown bear grizzly bear marine bear california seals the d olphin f amil y next we come to the dolphin family which includes the narwhal the grampuses and the porpoises well the true dolphins the n arwhal this is curious animal the male has very long straight tusk projecting from one side of its upper jaw this tusk is often much seven or eight feet in length and the ivory of which it is made is twisted round and round in spiral from base to tip in former days this tusk was thought to be the horn of the unicorn and the narwhal is often known the in reality this tusk is the upper eye tooth of the animal that on the hand side being very small and completely buried in the bone of the jaw now and then however both teeth are developed and narwhal was once killed which had one tusk seven feet ﬁve inches long and the other seven feet there are other teeth in the mouth and the female animal has tusks at all now what is the use of this singular weapon two or three answers have been given to this question some people have supposed example that it is used in spearing ﬁsh or in digging up buried mollusks from the mud at the bottom of the sea but the female narwhals require food just much the males how is it that they are not provided with tusks also other people have thought that when the winter is very severe and the ice on the surface of the sea is very thick the animal could bore hole through it with its tusk and 128 129 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https be able to breathe but then again female narwhals require air just they require food so this suggestion will not either the only explanation we can really give is that the narwhal tusk is weapon used in ﬁghting just like the antlers of the male deer at any rate narwhals have several times been seen they were taking part in kind of battle and striking and clashing their tusks together just though they were fencing with swords and when they are ﬁghting in earnest they must be able to use their long spears with terrible effect several times narwhal has charged ship and driven its tusk so deeply into her timbers that it was quite unable to withdraw it the ivory of which this weapon is made is of very ﬁne quality but the tusk is hollow the greater part of its length it is not very valuable narwhals are only found in the seas of the far north where they are sometimes seen swimming side by side together in large companies they grow to length of twelve feet or over and are dark gray in color on the upper part of the body and white underneath the back and sides being more or less mottled with gray the w hite w hale the white whale or beluga is something like large narwhal without tusk and is also dweller in the northern seas but it often ascends the larger rivers hundreds of miles in search of ﬁsh now and then it has been killed off the coasts of scotland and one example lived quite long time in the firth of forth going up the river day after day the tide came in and always retreating it began to fall the ﬁshermen were very anxious to kill it because of the quantities of ﬁsh which it devoured but it was so quick and active that it eluded them over and over again and three whole months passed away before at last they succeeded in one or two of the great rivers of north america white whales are regularly hunted the animals being ﬁrst driven up the stream and then caught with nets they return they yield large quantity of very pure oil and the which is used so largely in making boots and shoes is in reality prepared from their skins the t rue p orpoise the true porpoise or is much more widely distributed it likes to tumble and gambol on the surface of the sea quite close to the shore it will ascend tidal rivers too its range is mainly along the atlantic coast and it is also found on coasts of europe and in the paciﬁc ocean chasing porpoises in canoes and spearing them is an exciting canadian sport porpoises have curious way of swimming they travel along by series of bounds ﬁrst of all leaping almost out of the water and then diving under it when number of them are moving along in this way one behind the other they very often they look from little distance just like an enormous snake winding its way through the water and doubt have given rise to some of the tales about the great herd of porpoises will frequently follow sailing ship days sometimes apparently out of pure curiosity and sometimes in the hope of picking up something eatable among the rubbish that is thrown overboard but they are very much afraid of steamships and always keep at respectful distance from them they feed chieﬂy on ﬁsh and are so quick and active that even the salmon can not escape from them while they will follow up shoals of mackerel and herrings and destroy them in enormous numbers when fully grown the porpoise is rather more than ﬁve feet long the upper part of the body is almost black in color becoming paler on the sides while the lower surface is almost pure white the g rampus 130 131 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https largest and ﬁercest of all the memb ers of the dolphin family is undoubtedly the grampus which is also known the killer or killer it often reaches length of twenty feet or even more and is so savage and voracious that it has someti mes been called the wolf of the sea one of these animals was once found ﬂoating on the surface of the sea choked by seal which it had attempted to swallow and when its body was opened fourteen other seals and thirteen porpoises were taken from its stomach three or four killers will often combine in an attack upon large whale leaping upon it again and again and striking terriﬁc blows upon its body with their tails hang ing upon its lips like so many bulldogs biting and tearing its ﬂesh and often actually killing it the whale seems terriﬁed by the onslaught of the ferocious creatures and sometime s scarcely attempts to resist them apparently know ing quite well that they are sure to be victorious in the end the grampus is most plentiful in the northern seas but is found now and then in almost all parts of the ocean it occasionally visits the british shores once living specimen was exhibited in the brighton aquarium and did very well some little time but one day it got its snout jammed in the at the bottom of its tank so that it could not rise to the surface to spout and when the keeper discovered what had happened to it the poor creature was dead the b lackfish almost large the grampus but not nearly so savage is the blackﬁsh which is so called on account of its color it is not ﬁsh being member of the dolphin family it is found in great shoals generally consisting of two or three hundred animals and often of great many more which are always under the guidance of single leader wherever he goes they will always follow and they are such stupid creatures that if he swims into shallow water and casts himself ashore they will all swim after him and ﬂing themselves on the beach also in iceland and also in the faroe islands large numbers of them are often killed the ﬁshermen arranging their boats in semicircle between the shoal and the deep sea and then driving them forward till they strand themselves upon the shore in their efforts to escape large herds have also been driven ashore in the orkneys and the shetlands on the east coast of north america the blackﬁsh is one of the most abundant cetaceans off cape cod more than hundred blackﬁsh have been seen in one school and they are eagerly hunted the sake of the soft oil yielded by their fat dolphins there are two groups of dolphins the ﬁrst of which contains three animals that live in rivers and therefore are generally called dolphins the only one of these that we can mention is the gangetic dolphin which inhab its the great rivers of india and is named from the ganges its chief peculiarity is that it is almost totally blind although the animal grows to length of seven or eight feet and is bulky in proportion yet its eyeballs are larger than peas while the nerves of sight are so imperfect that it is quite possible that it may not be able to see at all this is deprivation to it however the rivers in which it lives are always so thick with mud that even if it had properly developed eyes it would be quite unable to use them the gangetic dolphin is very seldom seen because when it comes up to breathe it only raises just the above the surface of the water the same reason we know very little indeed about its habits but it seems to feed on shrimps and mollusks and also on certain ﬁshes which lie in the mud at the bottom of the water rooting about them with its snout after the manner of pig this anim al is often known the susu olphins 132 133 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https the we can only notice two the ﬁrst of these is the common dolphin which is found in great numbers in almost all parts of the temperate and tropical seas apparently it is not often to be found on american coasts but it has been captured in eastern harbors it generally lives in herds which will follow ships hours together leaping and gamboling on the surface of the sea and yet keeping pace with the vessel without the least apparent effort it feeds on ﬁshes to capture which and hold them ﬁrmly it has one hundred and ninety teeth so arranged that when the mouth is closed the upper and lower ones ﬁt in between one another like those of steel trap and hold the prey in grip from which there is escape dolphin is usually about seven feet long but much larger specimens are occasionally found the color is dark gray or glossy black above and almost pure white on the lower parts of the body the dolphin is rather smaller animal with shorter and more pointed beak shaped rather like the neck of bottle and is purple black above and grayish white below its range is on the north atlantic coast from maine to florida on the gulf coast and also on some of the coasts of europe mana tees and d ugongs there is just one other family of water which it will be convenient to mention here although they not really belong to the whale tribe these are the very curious creatures known sirenians the best known of them being the manatee and the dugong of course you have heard of mermaids those imaginary creatures of the sea which were supposed in days of old to combin the head and body of woman with the tail of ﬁsh well very likely stories of them were told in the ﬁrst place by some traveler who had seen manatee the animal has queer way of raising its head and the upper part of its body almost upright out of the water and cuddling its little one in its ﬂippers so that from little distance it really looks something like human being with child but at close quarters the comparison would not be very ﬂattering one there is kind of swelling at the end of the snout and the skin is black and coarse and wrinkled like that of an elephant manatees are found on the west coast of africa and also on the shores of south america living near the mouths of the larger rivers they never seem to leave the water of their own accord and if by any chance they ﬁnd themselves upon dry land they are perfectly helpless and can only roll over and over one specimen seen in zoo was quite small animal and had to be fed with milk out of baby bottle while the keep er nursed it upon his knees when it grew little bigger it became very playful and would tumble and roll about in its tank almost like dolphin or porpoise and more than once it even succeeded in knocking its keeper into the water another of these animals caught at the mouth of the essequibo river lived in an aquarium sixteen months it was about eight feet long and its tail was so powerful that every one was afraid the sides of its tank would be broken in by its tremendous blows its appetite was remarkably good it used to eat much pounds of lettuces every day there is species of manatee also called formerly ranging the south atlantic and gulf coasts of the united states but now seen only in the rivers and lagoons of southeastern florida where it has become so rare that the state prohibits its wanton destruction under penalty of heavy ﬁne the dugong is found on the east coast of africa and also on the coasts of mauritius ceylon the islands of the indian archipelago and western australia in many respects it is very much like the manatee but it has forked tail instead of rounded one and its body is bluish black above and whitish below it lives in shallow water near the mouths of rivers feeds on various water and is said to be so affectionate that if one of pair is killed the other can not be induced to leave the dead body but will remain by it and allow itself to be slaughtered also 134 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https very many years ago dugongs were found in large herds sometimes consisting of two or three hundred individuals and were so tame that they would even permit themselves to be touched without attempting to escape but they have been killed in great numbers the sake of their hides and valuable oil which is extracted from their bodies so that nowadays it seldom happens that more than two or three are seen together dugong is generally from seven to eight feet long and measures about six feet round the body the australian dugong is said to attain length of fourteen feet chapter xiv the rodent animals the group of the rodents is the largest of all the tribes of mammals it contains more than thousand different animals indeed nearly one third of all the mammals in the world belong to this very important division teeth of the g nawers the word rodent signiﬁes gnawing and is given to these creatures because their front teeth are specially formed the purpose of gnawing hard substances you know of course how long and sharp the front teeth of rat or mouse are and how easily these animals can nibble their way through stout piece of board well all the roden t animals have these teeth formed in just the same way and when we come to examine them we ﬁnd that they are beautifully suited to their purpose you would think that they are so constantly in use these teeth would quickly be worn down to the gums would you ours would if we employed them in the same way but then in the rodent animals these teeth never stop growing so that fast they are worn from above they are pushed up again from below sometimes this fact leads to very singular result it happens now and then that rodent animal meets with an accident and breaks off one of its front teeth now these teeth remember can not be used unless they have one another to work against just the blades of pair of scissors can not be used unless they have one another to cut against so you see when one tooth is broken short off the opposite tooth in the other jaw becomes useless it has nothing to work against so it is longer worn away from above but of course it still goes on growing so before very long it projects in front of the other teeth still it continues to grow and in course of time its natural curve brings it round in semicircle with the point toward the face and at last if it is lower tooth it pierces ﬁrst the ﬂesh of the forehead and then the skull beneath it and enters the brain and kills the animal while if it happens to be an upper tooth the point curls round under the chin and at length prevents the poor creature from opening its mouth so that it dies miserably of starvation it seems impossible does it yet in museums there are skeletons of hares and rabbits which have been killed in this singular way by one of their own front teeth how the t eeth are k ept s harp one would think that the edges of the teeth at any rate must soon be worn away nature has guarded against this danger by making these teeth of two different substances the face of the tooth is made of very thin plate of hard enamel the rest of the tooth of much softer bone during use of course the soft bone is worn away very much faster than the hard enamel and so the sharp cutting edge is preserved it is interesting to ﬁnd that we make our chisels in very similar way the blade is not solid piece of steel of the same quality throughout it consists of steel of two 135 136 137 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https qualities the face of the tool is very thin plate of extremely hard steel but the rest is of much softer metal and it is with the rodent tooth so it is with the chisel the soft metal is worn away during use much faster than the hard so that the edge is not destroyed only two pairs of front teeth are developed in the rodent animals and the eye teeth are wanting there is always gap in each jaw between these and the grinders the c ommon s quirrel first on our list of rodent animals comes the common red squirrel which of course you know by sight very well there are very few parts of the country where we may not see it frisking and gamboling among the branches of the trees or sitting upright on its hind quarters and nibbling away at nut which is delicately held between its front paws it skips up the trunk of tree quite easily it runs along the ground that is because its sharp little claws enter the bark and give it ﬁrm foothold and it scarcely ever falls from branch because its big bushy tail acts kind of like that of man walking upon tight rope and by stretching it straight out behind its body and turning it little bit to one side or little bit to the other the animal can nearly always manage to save itself from tumble even if it does fall however it does not hurt itself the skin of the lower part of the body is very loose and it is fastened little distance along the inner surface of each leg so when the animal falls from height it merely stretches out its limbs at right angles to its out the loose skin of course with so turns itself into kind of open umbrella just like the parachutes which are often sent down from balloons and instead of tumbling headlong to the ground and being killed by the fall it is buoyed up by the air and ﬂoats down comparatively slowly so that it is not hurt in the least the squirrel feeds on nuts acorns beechnuts bark buds and the young shoots of certain trees but it is also very fond of which it nibbles right down to the core and sometimes it will eat bird eggs in fact this squirrel is in the united states one of the most dreaded foes of nesting birds and they often attack it and chase it away from their homes early in the autumn it always lays up store of provisions hiding them away in hole in tree or more often in several holes then when warmer day than usual rouses it from its long winter sleep it goes off to its hoard and enjoys hearty meal these pretty little animals generally go about in pairs and the little ones are brought up in warm cosy nest made of leaves and moss it is placed either in the fork of lofty branch or in hole high up in and it is so perfectly made that rain never soaks through it and the wind never blows it away the g ray s quirrel this says hornaday is the most prominent squirrel of southern canada new england and the eastern and southern states southward to florida it ranges westward to minnesota kansas and texas above its color is clean which in southern specimens is mixed with dull yellow the lower surface is white varying to yellowish brown usually it nests in hollow trees but when crowded room builds an open nest of green leaves or strippings of cedar bark made into round ball the young are usually ﬁve in number the gray squirrel frequently consents to live in city parks and becomes quite tame it spends much of its time upon the ground searching nuts roots or anything which can be eaten here is good place to repeat some other words of hornaday there is other animal of equal size he says that can add so much of life and cheerfulness to hardwood forest or meadow good healthy squirrel why is it that american men and boys kill them so eagerly surely true sportsman or boy can ﬁnd any real in squirrels out of the and we might add that too often the desire to kill leads men and boys to destroy other kinds of innocent animal s instead 138 139 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https treating them friends to be enjoyed and whose right to live is just good that of human beings kindness toward harmless animals helps to make us kinder to each other flying s quirrels ﬂying squirrels are found in some parts of the world but like the colugo of which we have told already they not really ﬂy they merely skim from one tree to another by spreading out the very loose skin of the sides of the body and then leaping into the air in this way they can travel perhaps two or three hundred feet but rule they merely spring from branch to branch just like the common squirrel the largest and perhaps best known of these squirrels is the taguan which is found in india and siam and is about two feet in length not including the tail it is fairly abundant but is not very often seen all day long it is fast asleep in hole in some tree only coming out of its retreat after sunset several species of ﬂying squirrels are found in north america and often make their homes in garrets ground quirrels there are several squirrels that live upon the ground and not climb trees at all the most famous of these is the chipmunk or chipping squirrel which is very common in many parts of north america it is called chipmunk because when it is excited or alarmed it utters sharp little cry like the word over and over again this is an extremely pretty little animal its fur being brownish gray on the back and orange brown on the forehead and hind quarters while broad black stripe runs along the back and stripe edged with black along each side the throat and lower part of the body are white the chipmunk lives in burrows which it digs in the ground and very wonderful little burrows they are seldom less than eight or nine feet long with large at the end ﬁlled with moss and grass and dry leaves then on either side of the main burrow are several shorter ones which are used larders and in which large stores of provisions are packed away from one chipmunk nest have been taken nearly peck of acorns together with about quart of beechnuts two quarts of buckwheat few grains of corn and quantity of only three squirrels were found in this burrow so that they were in danger of starving during the winter were they the beechnuts have very sharp points and the chipmunk bites these carefully off before it attempts to pack the nuts away in its mouth it carries four nuts to its burrow at time putting one into each of its odd which are very much like those of certain monkeys and one into the mouth itself while the fourth is held between the teeth the chipmunk is very active little creature and its quick jerky movements it darts in and out among the herbage have often been compared to those of the wren prairie ogs the which is so called because it lives on the prairies of north america and utters an odd little yelping cry whic h is something like the bark of very small dog has several other names well sometimes it is known the and sometimes the wishtonwish it is quite small animal being seldom more than twelve inches in length without counting the tail and is reddish brown or brownish gray above and yellowish or brownish white beneath the tail is about four inches long in the great which lie to the east of the rocky mountains this quaint little animal is exceedingly plentiful it lives in under ground burrows and the earth which it digs out in making them is always piled up just outside the entrance in the form of mound about two feet high on the top of which it likes to sit upright squatting on its hind quarters dog does when begging at the slightest alarm it utters its queer little yelping cry throws sort of and dives into its burrow to reapp ear few minutes later when it thinks the danger has passed away 140 141 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https large number of always live together like rabbits in warren and sometimes the prairie far one can see is dotted all over with their mounds usually the animals are steadily moving eastward they increase ranching and farming spread over the plains the cultivation of hay and grain and the destruction of their natural enemies favor them in parts of texas and northward they are so destructive that united means of destroying them by poison have been adopted it was formerly thought that took in lodgers so to speak small owls known burrowing owls are often found in their tunnels together with rattlesnakes and it was supposed that all three lived peaceably together but now we know that this is not the case the owls are nearly always found in deserted burrows while the rattlesnakes undoubtedly enter the homes of the the purpose of feeding upon their young marmots not unlike rather big is the common marmot which is found in considerable numbers in the mountainous parts of northern europe and america here it is named whistler or sifﬂeur more familiarly known is the american woodchuck or groundhog which burrows deeply in the ﬁelds of almost every farm in the coun try these marmots are famous their winter sleep during the summer months they are very active and busy from about the middle of autumn till the beginning of spring however they are fast asleep in their burrows not waking up at all at least six months before entering upon this long slumber they pack their full of dry grass and in these warm beds survive the winter by the slow absorption of their fat so that when they come out they are very lean another kind of marmot called the bobac is found both in northern europe and in asia it is sometimes eaten food but is most difﬁcult to kill unless it is actually shot dead it sits it will nearly always contrive to get back into its burrow and if the animals are startled by the report of gun they all disappear under ground and will not be seen again several hours beavers one of the most interesting of all the rodent animals is the beaver which is found in the northern parts of europe asia and america it spends great part of its life in the water and doubt you have heard of the wonderful dams which it makes in order to prevent the rivers from drying up during the summer months when the animals want to construct one of these dams the ﬁrst thing they is to fell number of trees which stand near the banks of the river they this by gnawing through the stems quite close to the ground and they are able easily to cut through trunks ten or even twelve inches in diameter most likely one of the trees falls across the stream in that case they leave it it is then they strip off the bark from the others and cut up both the trunks and the larger branches into logs about four or ﬁve feet long these logs they arrange most carefully in position piling them upon one another and keeping them in their places by heaping stones and mud upon them they also ﬁll up all the gaps between them with mud and so hard they work that by the time the dam is ﬁnished it is often two hundred yards long ﬁfteen or even twenty feet thick at the bottom and six or eight feet high and when the river runs swiftly they are clever enough to make their dam in the form of curve so that it may be better able to resist the force of the current this dam causes the river to swell out into broad shallow pool and in districts where beavers are plentiful the whole course of stream is sometimes converted into series of pools made in this curious manner after time peat is formed round the edges and gradually spreads and then the marshy ground round the pool is called beaver meadow but beavers not only make dams they construct what are called lodges well to serve these are made by piling up number of logs mingled with clods of earth stones and clay and digging out the soil from underneath so to form 142 143 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of hut these lodges are and are from twelve to twenty feet in diameter the inside chamber being about seven feet wide so you see they have very thick walls and they are generally entered by at least two under ground passages all of which open in the below the surface of the water so that the animals can go straight from their lodge into the river without showing themselves above ground at all inside each lodge is bed of soft warm grasses and woodchips on which the animals sleep and it is even said by some hunters that each beaver has his own bed at any rate several animals of various ages live together in each lodge then near the lodge these wonderful creatures make ditch or hole which is so deep that even in the hardest winter the water in it never freezes quite to the bottom and in this deep place they pile up great quantity of logs and branches so that in winter they may have much bark they require to eat beavers are capital swimmers the toes of their hinder feet are joined together with webbing and make excellent oars while the broad ﬂat tail is very useful rudder they are very much hunted their fur is valuable while they also secrete curious substance known castor or castoreum which is used in medicine so in some parts of north america these animals are strictly preserved and only certain number may be killed every third year types of rodents european hamster east indian striped squirrel woodchuck marmot south american capybara south american vizcacha beaver the d ormouse everybody knows what sleepy little creature the dormouse is very often it may actually be picked up and handled without waking it sleeps all day long and hibernates from the middle of october till the beginning of april well so that it fully deserves its name of dormouse or it is found in europe and asia and sometimes in africa 144 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https germany it is called the haselmaus or because it is so fond of hazelnuts it eats these just the squir rel does holding them in its fore paws it sits upright on its hind quarters but it also feeds upon acorns beechnuts hips and haws and corn when it can get it dormice always make two nests during the year one being used during the summer and the other during the winter they are very warm and cosy little retreats about six inches in diameter and are made of grass leaves and moss sometimes numbers of the summer nests are found in thick bushes or among the low herbage at the bottom of hedge perhaps with the dormice fast asleep in them but the winter nests are generally more carefully hidden so that it is not very easy to ﬁnd them even when the leaves are off the bushes before it goes into hibernation in the autumn the dormouse becomes very fat but it does not sleep right through the winter without taking any food on very mild days it wakes up an hour or two and eats one of the nuts or acorns which it has carefully stored away in its nest jerboas the jerboa is an extremely curious animal and if you were to see it in the sandy deserts of the old world where it is found you would be very likely to mistake it small bird it has very short fore legs which it tucks up against its breast in such way that they can hardly be seen and very long hind ones on which it hops about in very manner but you would soon notice that it has long tail rather like that of mouse but which has tuft of hairs at the tip when it is leaping about it stretches this tail out behind it and seems to ﬁnd it of very great use in keeping its balance jerboas are very common in egypt and other parts of north africa and live in burrows which they dig in the sandy soil in order to enable them to obtain ﬁrm foothold on the slippery sand the soles of their feet are covered with long hairs which also prevent them from being scorched by contact with the heated ground but rule they not come out of their burrows until the evening when the sun is not so powerful it is during the middle of the day they feed upon grasses and dry shrubs but how they ﬁnd enough to eat in the desert places in which they live is rather hard to understand many different kinds of jerboas are known the best known the common jerboa is about big small rat and has tail about eight inches long in color it is so much like the sand that from few yards away it is almost impossible to see it even when it is skipping about the h amster this is queer little rodent which is found very plentifully in germany and also in many districts between that country and siberia it is rather stoutly built animal and measures nearly foot in length including the tail which is about two inches long in color it is generally light brownish yellow above and black beneath with black stripe on the forehead yellow patch on the back and white feet but hamsters are by means all alike and some are entirely black some pied and some entirely white you remember how dormice make summer and winter nests in the same way european hamsters make summer and winter burrows the summer burrow is quite small one not more than foot or two deep with small er at the bottom but the winter one is very much larger it is not only six feet long at least with quite big but there are from one to ﬁve side chambers well which are used granaries in these the animal stores up vast quantities of grain peas and beans many sixty pounds of corn having been taken from the burrow of single hamster and hundredweight of beans from that of another about the middle of october it stops up the entrances to its home and passes into state of hibernation in which it remains till the beginning of march about month longer it still remains in its burrow feeding on its stores and provisions till early in april it resumes its active life and returns to its summer habitation 145 146 the project

thousand have been killed in single season while an enormous quantity of grain was recovered from their tunnels water oles if you walk along the bank of stream in some european country you may often hear splash and see brownish animal about eight inches long swimming away through the water this is water often called water although it belongs to quite different family from that of the true rats and if one looks down the side of the bank he will see its burrow which generally runs into the ground some little distance are usually supposed to be mischievous but during the greater part of the year they feed only on water being specially fond of the sweet pith of the wild ﬂags in winter however when food of this kind is scarce they will nibble away the bark of small trees and shrubs and sometimes good deal of damage in osier while they will also visit cultivated ﬁelds in order to feed on vegetables the water is very good swimmer although its toes are not webbed and its fur is so close and so glossy that it throws off the water just like the feathers on duck back near relation of the water is the or also called which is found very commonly in most parts of europe and also in north and south america it is about big an ordinary mouse and is grayish brown in color which becomes rather paler on the lower parts of the body this animal is found chieﬂy in meadows where it makes long runs beneath the grass and also burrows into the ground it is always plentiful and sometimes appears in such vast numbers that it can only be described plague the muskrat which is one of the most widely distributed and important of american animals is really sort of big aquatic vole lemmings still more mischievous in norway and sweden are the odd little rodents known lemmings which make their appearance from time to time literally in millions they always seem to come down from the mountains and when once they have begun their journey nothing will stop them if they come to river they swim across it if to house they climb over it if to stack of corn or hay they eat their way through it large numbers of wolves foxes weasels stoats hawks and owls soon discover the swarm and kill off the animals in thousands but still the great army moves steadily on leaving the country perfectly bare behind it until it reaches the sea and then those behind push on those in front till almost the whole vast host perish in the waves these great migrations take place rule about once in seven years and one seems to know quite where the lemmings come from or why they travel in this singular manner these strange little animals not seem to know what fear is if passer happens to meet one of them it will never turn aside but will sit up and yelp deﬁantly at him while if dog goes up and examines it the chances are that it will try to bite his nose in color the european lemming is blackish brown above and yellowish white below while its length is about six inches various kinds of rodents known

wood https brown rat and the black rat of course are only too common everywhere they seem to have come in the ﬁrst place from asia and have spread to almost all parts of the world almost every ship that sails the sea is infested with rats some of which are nearly certain to make their way ashore at every port at which she touches rats are rather formidable animals besides being very savage number of them will often combine together in order to attack common foe we have known large cat example to be so severely wounded by rats that after lying in great pain two or three days it actually died of its injuries rats are very bloodthirsty creatures if one of their own number is caught in trap they will tear it in pieces and devour it they will enter at night and kill the birds they roost upon their perches while if they can ﬁnd their way into they will even destroy the rabbits in barns and farmyards rats are very mischievous and are often infested by them how often they get into houses you know too well but on the other hand they often great deal of good by devouring substances which would otherwise decay and poison the air so that they are not altogether without their uses people annoyed by them are too apt to suppose rats generally have three broods of little ones in the course of the year and there are from eight to fourteen in each brood you can easily understand how it is that these animals multiply so rapidly mice still more plentiful and almost mischievous is the common mouse which is found both in town and country and this too seems to have been in the ﬁrst place native of asia and to have since spread to almost all parts of the world there is need of course to describe its appearance and most of us are familiar with its habits so we will pass on at once to one of its near relations which is not quite so well known namely the in some respects this animal is very much like the but you can tell it at once by its more pointed muzzle by its much larger ears and above all by its very much longer tail it lives in gardens ﬁelds and hedgerows but often takes shelter in houses and barns during the winter but all through the spring summer and autumn it occupies burrows in the ground and very often it lays up quite large quantities of provisions in its tunnels winter use just the hamster does in germany it does not always dig these burrows itself however very often it will take possession of the deserted run of mole or even of natural hollow beneath the spreading roots of tree general rule this little animal is only but when food is scarce it will kill and devour small animals and has even been known to prey upon its own kind the pretty little is the smallest of the european rodents is seldom more than four and half inches long of which almos t one half is occupied by the tail and it would take six of the little creatures to weigh an ounce the is not found rule near human habitations but lives in ﬁelds and pastures but sometimes it is carried home in sheaves of corn at and in that case it lives in the ricks during the winter generally however it spends the winter months fast asleep in burrow in the ground then when the warm months of spring come round it wakes up and sets about building most beautiful little nest of grasses and leaves which it always suspends among or at some little height from the ground this nest is about large baseball and the odd thing about it is that you can never ﬁnd any entrance apparently when the little builder wishes to go in and out it pushes its way between the strips of grass of which the nest is composed and then carefully arranges them again in position and it is so cleverly built that when eight or nine little mice which are brought up inside it begin to grow it stretches to suit their increasing size so that their nursery is always just big enough to contain them 149 150 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https is capital climber and runs up and down the with great activity even though they bend nearly to the ground under its weight the tip of its tail strange to say is prehensile just like that of spider porcupines of course you know what porcupine is like with its coat of long bristling spines indeed the word porcupine means spiny pig and refers partly to the spikes and partly to the odd grunting noise which the animal utters from time to time there are several different kinds of porcupine in the old world and in america the common porcupine is found in the south of europe and also in the northern and western parts of africa and grows to length of about two feet four inches not including the tail the quills are of two kinds first of all there are number of long slender spines which bend quite easily and are not of very much use weapons but under these is close array of very much stiffer ones from ﬁve to ten inches long and these are very formidable indeed they are so loosely fastened to the skin that when the animal backs upon foe good many of them are sure to be left sticking in its ﬂesh while further they are made in such manner that they keep on boring their way farther and farther in and in course of time may penetrate vital organ and cause death even tigers have sometimes lost their lives through the quills of porcupine which they had been trying to kill and devour the animal is not at all fond of ﬁghting however and never attacks unless it is provoked during the daytime the porcupine is seldom seen being fast asleep in its burrow but soon after sunset it leaves its retreat and wanders to long distances in search of the roots bark upon which it feeds in the woods it loves to prowl around camps and eat every scrap of leather or greasy board it can ﬁnd in north america is found the canada porcupine ranging from new england westward to ohio and northward to hudson bay another species in the west and northwest is the porcupine in mexico central america and south america are other species known it has been widely supposed that porcupines shoot their quills but this belief has foundation when attacked hornaday tells us its defence consists in erecting its quills and striking quickly strong sidewise blow with the tail which often drives many quills into its enemy the c hinchilla this pretty little rodent is famous its beautiful silky fur which is in much request women garments in appearance it is rather like large dormouse with very big rounded ears and short hairy tail it is found in bolivia chile and peru and lives high up among the mountains in burrows in the ground large number of the anima ls always dwell together so that their burrows form kind of large warren and they dart up and down the steep rocks with such wonderful speed that it is almost impossible to follow their movements when it is feeding the chinchilla sits upright like squirrel and conveys the food to its mouth with its fore paws it lives chieﬂy upon roots and the districts in which it lives are so wild and barren it often has to travel long distances in order to obtain them the v iscacha closely related to the chinchilla is the viscacha which is found very abundantly in the great pampas districts of south america it generally lives in little colonies of from twenty to thirty animals which dig their burrows close together and heap up the earth which they scrape out into one common mound these burrows are generally dug in the form of the letter y and often number of them communicate with one another by means 151 152 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https short passages so that if the little animals feel in want of society they can easily go and see their friends these colonies are called viscacheras and in some parts of the argentine republic the plains are closely studded with them far the eye can reach viscachas have curious way of clearing off all the vegetation that grows near their burrows and piling up the refuse in mound near the entrance they will also collect together any hard objects which they may happen to ﬁnd and we are told by darwin that sometimes quite of bones stones and lumps of earth may be found outside the entrance to single burrow and that traveler who dropped his watch one evening found it next day by searching the in the neighborhood in appearance the viscacha is not unlike rather small marmot but the fur is gray above with dusky markings and white below while the face is crossed by two black bands with broad white stripe between them the gouti this animal found in south america and the west indies was formerly very plentiful some parts literally swarming but it did so much mischief in cultivated ground that it was trapped and shot in immense numbers and it has now almost entirely disappeared from many districts in which it once abounded the ﬁrst point that strikes one on looking at the agouti is the great length of its hind legs so long are these limbs that the animal ﬁnds good deal of difﬁculty in running downhill and often tumbles head over heels and rolls several yards before it can recover its footing and the same reason when it is running at any pace on level ground it travels along by kind of gallop which is really made up of series of leaps the agouti comes out only by night it is difﬁcult animal to watch and it is so wary that it can not be approached without great caution all the time while it is feeding it keeps on turning its head ﬁrst to one side and then to the other so that it can scarcely ever be taken by surprise if it should be captured however it never seems to ﬁght and has idea of using either its sharp teeth or its claws to defend itself so sometimes it has been thought that an agouti would make very nice pet those who have allowed it to run loose in the house however have seldom repeated the experiment it will ruin any article of furniture in very short time and will cut its way through the stoutest door in few minutes when fully grown the agouti is rather more than eighteen inches long and in general color it is olive brown but the hair of the hinder quarters which is very much longer than that of the rest of the body is golde n brown while the middle line of the lower part of the body is almost white the c apybara few people on seeing capybara the ﬁrst time would take it to be rodent it looks much more like wild pig it has very heavily built body which almost touches the ground it waddles along short stiff bristly hair and great feet indeed it is sometimes called the water yet we only have to look at its front teeth to see that it really is rodent after all the capybara is native of south america and is generally found in the damp marshy ground near the banks of the larger rivers it is good swimmer and always makes the water when alarmed it is good diver too and can easily remain below the surface seven or eight minutes without requiring to breathe so that if it can once plunge into the river it is safe from almost any foe when fully grown the capybara is about four feet long and weighs nearly one hundred pounds in fact it is the largest of all the rodent animals in color it is reddish brown above and brownish yellow beneath and it is further remarkable having tail at all 153 154 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https and r abbits the hares and rabbits of which our account is taken from the life of mammal s by ernest ingersoll form compact family of some sixty species scattered in all divisions of the globe except australasia and madagascar but only one species occurs in south america and the family is most numerous in northerly regions where these animals form an important food resource man and beast all are much alike in the long haunched hind legs which give great leaping and dodging power tall erectile ears divided upper lip short scut and grizzled coat with various speciﬁc markings of white and black the only exceptional one is the hispid hare of northeastern india which has small eyes bristly short ears short hind legs and much the manner of rabbit the term rabbit has wholly replaced hare in america because the common small hare of the eastern united states quickly seen by the ﬁrst english settlers looked to them more like the rabbit they had known at home than like their bigger hare and they ignored the difference in habits they did so many other facts in their careless naming of the animals of the new world after those of europe it must always be remembered that the ﬁrst pilgrims puritans and southern adventurers were mainly from cities and knew little of rural things to which ignorance by the way they owed most of their early misfortunes in the colonies the true rabbit or cony differs from its relatives by its small size average weight two and half to three pounds short ears and hind legs but more in its habits its young are born naked blind and helpless and it is comparatively hence it has been compelled to become burrower the safety of both itself and its babies and is usual with animals become burrowers has acquired the habit of gathering in communities whose crowded digging s or warrens are labyrinths of subterranean runways even this however would hardly sufﬁce to preserve this timid and nearly defenceless race were not several litter s of ﬁve to eight young leverets produced by each pair annually to make good the loss from enemies and disease the original european wild rabbit is grayish brown becoming foxy on the neck but this rabbit has been domesticated since ancient times and alterations of coloring well of form have been produced ten or more distinct breeds are recognized by fanciers some of which the the great belgian and the angora are far away from the original type their amazing fecundity has caused rabbits to multiply into an almost uncontrollable pest since they were unwisely introduced into australia and new zealand where the scarcity of beasts of prey allowed them to increase without bounds in few years therefore the whole country was overr un by millions which threatened to devour not only all the crops but every bit of wild herbage even in europe when any reason their subjection is neglected they great damage to gardens orchards and plantations of young trees at present further use is being made of the rabbits by packing their edible ﬂesh in various forms an article of preserved food which is ﬁnding wide market and probably the pest will be abated in course of time by natural processes returning to the hares not much need be said to particular species all dwell either in open grassy country or else among rocks and bushes they not ﬂock nor make any sort of shelter but each inhabits certain small district where it makes smooth place called its form to this it will return day after day long time unless frightened and in such form the young are born and are left concealed when still in the suckling age under cover of leaves and vines or even fur plucked by the mother from her own loose coat and felted into sort of blanket they seek better shelter than this in winter except that some our common little cottontail will creep into the mouth of an old skunk or woodchuck hole or within hollow stump to seek protection from the cauld blast the jacks of the plains are so well furred that even the soles of their feet are warm mats of hair and they are the only small animals able to survive outside of burrows the intense winter cold and gales of those bleak uplands this hardihood is due primarily of course to the fact that hares are able to ﬁnd nutritious forage all through the winter and so keep up their bodily heat 155 156 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https types of ca ttle

antelopes deer horses swine elephants and rhinoceroses all belong to this order first let us notice some of the wild oxen the g aur the largest of these is the gaur whic h is found in india it is very big animal sometimes standing more than six feet in height at the shoulder and it has long and very powerful horns it is much dreaded by the natives rule however it is very gentle and peaceable animal scarcely ever venturing to attack man and only dwelling in those remote parts of the jungle to which even hunters seldom ﬁnd their way the gaur lives in small herds generally of from ten to twenty in number each of these is led by an old bull and there are generally two or three younger ones the rest being cows and calves when the younger bulls grow up they usually ﬁght the old one in order to take his place some time he contrives to hold his own but when at last he is beaten he goes of f and lives in the thickets by himself these solitaries they are called are generally very savage and will often rush out and attack passer even when he has not provoked them at all the gaur is very wary animal and sentries are always posted near the herd in order to give warning of the approach of foe when feeding they are said to stand in circle with their heads outward so that they can see in every direction the old male gaurs are nearly black in color and the younger ones and the cows reddish brown while they all have white stockings from the knee downward the y ak the yak which lives in tibet is something like an ox with great masses of hair on its ﬂanks limbs and tail in color it is blackish brown with little white upon the muzzle and in height is about ﬁve feet six inches at the shoulder the thick fringes of hair not begin to grow till it is about three months old and the young calf is covered all over with curly black hair like newfoundland dog the yak lives among the mountains sometimes climbing to height of fully twenty thousand feet and scrambles about among the boulders with wonderful activity large herds of these animals however have been domesticated and are used beasts of burden while their ﬂesh is said to be almost tender and beef the big tufted tail too is highly valued it is dyed in various colors and is then employed in making the which are used so much in eastern countries driving away ﬂies the b ison the famous bison commonly called buffalo of north america sad to say is now almost extinct there are only few small herds living under special protection yet not so very many years ago these magniﬁcent animals wandered over the prairies in millions even single herd sometimes would extend farther than the eye could reach and we read of one herd which covered tract of country ﬁfty miles long and miles broad but these herds were recklessly destroyed the sake of their hides and tongues and now there are only few wild buf faloes left alive altogether generally however buffaloes are to be seen in zoos and if you go to look at them you will most likely think that the male looks rather like very big lion it has an 158 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https mane of long shaggy hair which covers the head and shoulders there is also sort of long beard under the chin and the hair of the sides and hind quarters is very thick the consequence is that the animal looks great deal bigger than it really is although it stands well over ﬁve feet high at the shoulders in spite of its great mass of hair this is very active animal and it can both trot and gallop with considerable speed when galloping it always holds its head close to the ground and its tail high up in the air it is not by any means courageous animal notwithstanding its size and strength but the bulls ﬁght most savagely with one another roaring so loudly that in the days of the great herds the noise was compared to thunder and could be heard miles another kind of bison called the aurochs lives in the great forests of northern europe its mane is not so long and thick that of the american animal but its horns are longer and not so strongly curved the c ape b uffalo smaller than the bison but very much more formidable is the cape buffalo which is spread over almost the whole of africa south of the equator it is about big an ordinary bullock and has pair of mass ive and sharply pointed curved horns which are sometimes much three feet in length this animal lives in reedy swamps and is generally found in herds which often number from 250 to 300 individuals they are very wary and difﬁcult to approach while they are so swift of foot that only very fast horse can escape from them when carrying rider on its back in charging they throw their heads back with the horns upon the shoulders and then suddenly bend down and strike upward when they come within reach the buffalo does not usually attack unless it is wounded however though solitaries will often lie in concealment and rush out upon the hunter he passes by the i ndian b uffalo there is another kind of buffalo found in india which is very different anim al in every way it is different in appearance it has its head drawn out into kind of muzzle while its

threatening manner seem never to actually attack man so long he has the courage to stand perfectly still the m usk x though it is called an ox and looks like an ox this animal is in reality much more closely related to the sheep it is of about the size of rather large ram but looks much bigger than it really is owing to the great masses of long hair which cover the whole of its body and hang down so far that one can scarcely see its legs at all it is even more hairy than the yak the horns of the male animal are very curiously formed they are so broad and ﬂat at the base that they form kind of helmet which covers almost the whole of the forehead they then droop downward on either side of the face but curve upward and outward at the tips those of the cow however are very much smaller the lives in the most northerly parts of north america it is perfec tly at home amid the snow and ice and lives in the wildest and dreariest regions in which the ground scarcely thaws during the whole of

drive it to bay on some rocky mountain slope and tear it to the ground by the mere force of numbers the name of this animal is due to the musky ﬂavor of its ﬂesh which is said to be very tender and delicate sheep the sheep are represented at the present time by several wild species one of which is found in northern india east of the indus in the punjab and in sind one in north america and another in north africa the rest inhabit the high ground of europe and asia far south the himalayas these mountains with the adjacent plateaus of the pamirs and the great ranges of central asia form

the country is quite open the uropean m ouflon the only wild sheep of europe is the mouﬂon found in the mountains of corsic and sardinia its height at the shoulder is about inches in the rams the horns are strong and curved into spiral forming almost complete circle the hair is close and in winter has woolly under in summer and autumn the coat is bright red brow n on the neck shoulders and legs the rump and under parts are whitish and the back and ﬂanks marked with white saddle in winter the brown becomes darker and the white saddle broader rather larger mouﬂon is found on the elburz mountain range in persia in armenia and in the taurus mountains smaller variety exists in cyprus where it has been preserved since the british occup ation the mouﬂon is typical wild sheep in sardinia

is found in siberia and mon golia and also in tibet it is the largest of all living wild sheep and is about big large donkey and has enormous twisted and wrinkled horns which are sometimes much four feet long and nineteen inches round at the base the male tibetan argali has ruff on the throat the usual color is stony gray mingled with white in summer in the case of the old males the argali rams are very fond of ﬁghting one another and such ﬁerce conﬂicts take place that sometimes their horns are broken short off and left lying upon the ground and it will give you some idea of the size of these horns when we tell you that more than once fox has been found lying fast asleep in one of them 161 162 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https argali is animal

actively over rocks and up and down precipices that is it quite impossible to follow them it has sometimes been said that when the argali leaps from height it alights on its horns which break the

beards on the chins of the same sex by the absence of glands in the hind feet which sheep possess and by certain variations in the formation of the skull the difference between the temperament of the sheep and goats is very curious and persistent showing itself in marked way which affects their use in domestication to such degree that the keeping of one or the other often marks the owners possessors of different degrees of civilization goat s are restless curious adventurous and so active that they can not be kept in enclosed ﬁelds this reason they are not bred in any numbers in lands where agriculture is practised on modern principles they are too enterprising and too destructive consequently the goat is usually only seen in large ﬂocks on mountain pastures and rocky uncultivated ground where the ﬂocks are taken out to feed by the children on the high alps in greece on the apennines and in palestine the goat is valuable domestic animal the milk butter and cheese and also the

white from the brown also blackish chest and some gray on the ﬂank in the caucasus turs are found on the high crags above the in summer whence they descend at night to feed on patches of upland grass

descendant of this species the i bex of the ibex perhaps the best known of all the wild goats several species differing somewhat in size and in the form of their horns are found in various parts of the old world of these the arabian ibex inhabits the mountains of southern arabia palestine and sinai upper egypt and perhaps morocco the abyssinian ibex is found in the high mountains of the country from which it takes its name the alpine ibex is now extinct in the swiss alps and tyrol but survives on the piedmontese side of monte rosa the asiatic ibex is the ﬁnest of the group its horns have been found to measure nearly ﬁve inches along the curve this ibex inhabits the mountain ranges of central asia from the altai to the himalayas and the himalayas far the source of the ganges the king

being the impossibility of conﬁn ing them they will spring on to the roof of house and spend the day there by preference though allowed the run of all the premises the kids are generally two in number

america possesses only one species of wild goat the place of this genus being taken in the southern part of the continent by the guanacos the rocky mountain goat the north american representative of the group has very few of the characteristics of the european and asiatic species in place of being active in body and lively in temperament it is quiet rather drowsy creature able it is true to scale the high mountains of the northwest and to live among the snows but with none of the energetic habits of the ibex or the tahr in form it is heavy and badly built it is heavy in front and weak behind like bison the eye is small the head large and the shoulders humped it feeds usually on very high ground but hunters who take the trouble to ascend to these altitudes ﬁnd little difﬁculty in killing many wild goats they wish these goats are most numerous in the ranges of british columbia where they are found in small ﬂocks of from three or four to twenty several may be killed before the herd is thoroughly alarmed possibly because at the high altitudes at which they are found man has seldom disturbed them none of the domesticated sheep or goats of the new world are native to the continent of america it is curious fact well worth studying from the point of view of the history of man that with the exception of the llama the dog and perhaps the pig every domesticated animal in use from cape horn to the arctic ocean has been imported the last of these importations is the reindeer which though the native species abounds in the canadian woods was obtained from lapland and eastern asia when the ﬁrst rush to klondike was made the miners were imprisoned and inaccessible during the late winter the coming of spring was the earliest period at which communication could be expected to be restored and even then the problem of feeding the transport animals was difﬁcult one the united states government decided to try to open up road from alaska by means of sledges drawn by reindeer and the canadian government devised similar scheme agents were sent to lapland and to the tribes on the western side of bering sea and deer drivers and harness obtained from both the deer were not used the klondike relief expeditions by the americans but the animals and their drivers were kept in alaska native reindeer were caught and were found very useful carrying the mails in winter the c hamois the goats are linked with the antelopes by the famous chamois which is especially interesting because it makes its home among the mountains of europe it is pretty little creature about two feet in height with pair of short black horns which spring upright from the forehead and are then sharply hooked with the points directed backward and its coat strange to say instead of becoming paler in winter grows darker so that from brownish yellow it deepens into rich chestnut 173 174 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https chamois is one of the most active of all living animals leaping from rock to rock and skipping up and down steep cliffs where it would seem quite impossible it to obtain any foothold at all it will often spring down too from very great height never seeming to injure itself and always alighting upon its feet and it is very and exceedingly wary hunter ﬁnds the utmost difﬁculty in approaching and very often days together he never has the chance of obtaining shot when chamois notices any sign of danger it utters shrill whistling cry on hearing which all the members of the herd instan tly take to ﬂight there are generally from ﬁfteen to twenty animals in each herd consisting partly of does and partly of young bucks the old bucks spend most of the year quite by themselves but early in the autumn they rejoin the herds drive away their younger rivals and then ﬁght ﬁerce battles with one another the mastery the young of the chamois are born in may or june and are so strong and active that when they are only day old they can follow their mother almost anywhere the land this is the ﬁnest of the antelopes and is really magniﬁcent animal it stands from ﬁve to six feet high at the shoulder and sometimes an eland weighs nearly ﬁfteen hundred pounds both the buck and the doe have spirally twisted horns which are generally about two feet long and there is heavy dewlap under the throat in color the animal is pale fawn but sometimes the old males are bluish gray in former days the eland was spread all over southern and eastern africa but it has been so much hunted on account of its hide that it has quite disappeared from south africa and is fast disappearing elsewhere there seems reason to fear that soon this splendid antelope will be altogether extinct it lives the most part in wooded plains and is generally found in large herds which spend the daytime hiding in the forests and come out into the open country by night to graze and drink in the desert districts however where water is scarce they quench their thirst by feeding upon melons the eland is difﬁcult animal to hunt besides being very wary and very timid it is often accompanied by ird which gives it early warning of the approach of foe and further it is very swift of foot so that it can only be ridden down by good horse rule it will never ﬁght but when doe has calves with her she will withstand the onset of dogs and has even been known to impale them upon her horns the k udu this is another very ﬁne antelope it can easily be distinguished from the eland by the shape of the horns of the male which are twisted like corkscrew while the female has none at all besides this it has white mark across its face shaped something like the letter v several white spots on its cheeks and throat white streak along its back and several others running down its sides and hinder quarters it stands rather more than four feet in height at the shoulder and the horns are often more than three feet long the kudu is found all over africa from the cape to abyssinia though it is now very rare in the extreme south it does not live in herds rule but is generally found in pairs which pass the day in dense thicke ts and come out to graze in the evening it is not very swift of foot and can easily be run down by man on horseback but it is chieﬂy found in the country infested by the terrible whose bite kills horses in few days it is generally

having thrust his horns deep into the lion body and been quite unable to withdraw them what the gemsbok feeds upon is rather mystery it is often found in districts where there is vegetation except little dry scrub yet it nearly always seem s to be in good condition and it is odder still to ﬁnd that months together sometimes it must go without drinking some hunters indeed have declared that they are quite positive that the animal never drinks at all obtaining all the moisture it needs from small watermelons and certain bulbous roots the gemsbok is of about the same size the kudu and is gray in color above and white below but there is black streak across the face while another streak which is much broader runs along the sides dividing the gray of the upper parts from the white of the lower this antelope is hunted on horseback and is so swift and so enduring that there is said to be animal in africa which is harder to overtake the s pringbok the most graceful and elegant of all the antelopes are the gazelles of which we may take the springbok an example in former days this was by far the most abundant of all the african game animals and would sometimes be seen traveling from one district to another in enormous herds covering the country far the eye could reach so vast were these herds indeed and so closely did the animals march side by side together that sometimes lion would be 177 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https in their ranks marching along with them quite unable to stop or to make his escape because of the pressure all round him the springbok or springbuck owes its name to its marvelous activity and to its curious habit of suddenly leaping straight up into the air in this way it can easily spring to height of eight or ten feet the springbok is easily tamed and soon comes to know who are its friends one of these animals was kept pet by lady living at klerksdorp in south africa and would wander about the town by itself not seeming to be in the least afraid of the or even of the dogs every morning too it would cross the river and go out upon the veldt to feed and although it would mix freely with its wild companio ns during the day it always left them in the evening and came home to sleep in height the springbok stands about two feet six inches and it can easily be distinguished from all the other gazelles by the white streak which runs along the middle of the back the horns are black with number of rings running round them and the color of the coat is dark above and white beneath with blackish stripe on the ﬂanks between the two gnus if the gazelles are the most graceful of all the antelopes the gnus also known wildebeests are certainly the most ungainly their great broad heads and very high shoulders giving them an extremely awkward appearance then the curved horns are very broad at the base and are set so closely together on the forehead that they form sort of helmet like those of the cape buffalo while the muzzle is fringed with long bristles and there is an upright mane of stiff hairs upon the neck so that altogether the gnu can not be considered handsome animal two kinds of gnus are known both of which are found in southern and eastern africa the commoner of the two is called the gnu because it has long white tail while the other the brindled gnu has black one both animals stand about four feet six inches in height at the shoulder gnus are very suspicious very inquisitive and very timid and when they catch sight of human being they often behave in most extraordinary way prancing about pawing the ground capering on their hind legs leaping into the air and whisking their long tails about in the most absurd manner then some will chase the others round and round in circles next they will come charging on in long line like cavalry though they meant to attack and then quite suddenly the whole herd will wheel round and dash off together enveloped in cloud of dust they are so inquisitive that hunter has often attracted gnu to within very few yards just by tying red handkerchief to the muzzle of his gun and allowing it to ﬂutter in the breeze like ﬂag other antelopes that we should like to tell about have been described by travele rs and hunters the sable antelope of south africa example is regarded by ernest ingersoll perhaps the most admirab le of all

height is chieﬂy due to the great length of the neck yet there are only seven vertebræ or joints of the spine in that part of the body just there are in our own necks but then each of these joints may be much foot long when the animal is hungry its height is of very great use to it enabling it to feed upon the leaves of trees which not throw out branches near the ground and in captivity of course its manger has to be put quite close to the roof of its stable strange to say the giraffe plucks each leaf separately by means of its tongue which is very long indeed and very slender and is prehensile at the tip like the tail of spider monkey so it can be coiled round the stem of leaf in order to pull it from the branch and sometimes at the zoo you may see giraffe snatch ﬂowers out of ladies hats and bonnets by means of this curious tongue if giraffe wants to feed upon grass instead of leaves it straddles its front legs very widely apart and then bends its long neck down between them and it does just the same when it drinks the giraffe is fast runner and horse must be very swift to overtake it it runs in most singular manner with queer gallop and throwing out the hind legs with semicircular movement while its long neck goes rocking backward and forward like that of toy donkey and the long tail switches up and down regularly if it were moved by clockwork so long line of giraffes all running away together must look very odd indeed you would think that giraffes would be very easily seen even in the forest would you yet every hunter tells us that long they are standing still it is almost impossible to detect them since they look just like the stems and foliage of the trees with the sunlight shining in patches between the leaves giraf fes are found in various parts of africa south of the sahara and two different varieties are known that from south africa being much the darker of the two and having the spots much larger and closer together third kind with ﬁve of the horns on the head has been recorded by sir harry johnston the kapi still more remarkable discovery made in the same forest district by the same famous explorer was that of the okapi which is very singular animal perhap s we can best describe it to you by saying that it is something like giraffe and something like an antelope and something like zebra and something like an ox the color of its coat is like that of very red cow there are stripes on the fore and hind quarters and the legs are while on the skull are faint traces of horns like those of the giraffe we not yet know much about the habits of this wonderful animal except that it lives in the thickest parts of the forest seems to go about in pairs and to feed wholly on leaves and twigs the d eer in some ways these animals are not unlike antelopes but one great difference between the two is this in the antelope s the horns are hollow growing upon bony cores which spring from the skull and remain all through the life of the animal but in the deer they are solid and are thrown off every year fresh ones growing in their places in the 180 181 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of four or ﬁve months then the material of which they are made is altogether different whereas the horns of the antelopes really consist of highly compressed hair those of the deer are composed of lime and are very much more like bone on account of these dif ferences horns of deer are better called antlers the way in which these antlers grow is very curious some little time after they are shed the animal is extremely timid he knows perfectly well that he has lost his natural weapons so he hides away in the thickest parts of the forest where none of his enemies are likely to ﬁnd him after while two little knobs make their appearance on the head just where the horns used to be these knobs are covered with close furry skin which is known the velvet and if you were to take hold of them you would ﬁnd that they were quite hot to the touch that is because the blood is coursin g rapidly through them and leaving particles of lime behind it it goes day by day they increase in size throwing out branches they so until they are rather larger than the pair which were cast off then the close up and the velvet becomes dry and begins to fall off sometimes hanging down in long strips which are at last rubbed off against the trees and bushes reindeer and c aribou great many kinds of deer are found in different parts of the world perhaps the most famous of all being the reindeer this is the only deer in which the does possess horns well the stags it is found in the northern parts of europe and asia and also of north america where it is called the caribou and generally lives in large herds during the winter and spring these herds remain in the forests but in summer they are so annoyed by ﬂies that they make their way to the hills ascending to such height that their insect enemies can not follow them and there they remain until the autumn number of herds usually join together when they are migrating in this way and the appearance of thousands upon thousands of the animals traveling slowly along each with its antlers uplifted has been compar ed to that of moving forest of leaﬂess trees in siberia lapland and norway large herds of reindeer are kept we keep cattle and are used beasts both of draught and burden single reindeer can carry weight of about 130 pounds upon its back or draw load of 190 pounds upon sledge and it so enduring that it will travel at the rate of from eight to ten miles an hour twelve hours together the caribou says ingersoll has never been utilized by any of the people of arctic america although just across bering strait the same animal was kept in large herds by the chuckchis of siberia the united states government has attempted to repair this deﬁciency by introducing large numbers of lapp reindeer among the alaskans and the experiment is proving successful see also page 173 during the summer reindeer can obtain plenty of food but in the winter they have to live upon kind of white lichen which grows in waste dry places very often of course this is covered with snow which the animals have to scrape away with their hoofs but when slight thaw is followed by frost they ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to this and sometimes they actually perish from starvation the color of the reindeer varies slightly at different seasons of the year the coat usually being sooty brown in summer and brownish gray in winter the nose neck hind quarters and lower parts of the body are always white or whitish gray the people of lapland finland and siberia have long time domesticated reindeer ﬁnding their ﬂesh good to eat and their hides horns and sinews valuable making clothing and implements of various kinds their milk makes excellen t cheese which in those regions is an important article of food the lk or m oose the elk which is found in the same parts of the world the reindeer is much larger animal indeed it is the biggest of all living deer stag standing well 182 183 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https six feet in height at the withers and sometimes weighing much twelve hundred pounds it is not at all graceful creature the neck is very short and the head is held below the level of the shoulders while the antlers are so enormously large that it hardly seems possible that the animal should be able to carry them one would think that when the elk was traveling through the forest these huge antlers would be constantly getting entangled among the branches of the trees but the animal is able to throw them well back upon its shoulders so that they not really interfere with its progress in the least in america this animal is known the moose and is generally found in small parties consisting of buck doe and their fawns of two seasons during the summer they live near swamps or rivers where there is plenty of rich long grass but soon winter comes on they retire to higher ground and spend the next few months in small clearing in the midst of the thickest forest these clearings are generally called yards and you might think perhaps that when hunter had discovered one he would have difﬁculty in shooting the animals but they are so wary that it is almost impossible to approach them either by day or by night and many hunter has followed them weeks without obtaining shot the indians attract the moose within range by imitating the cry of the doe which they so cleverly that if buck is within hearing he is sure to come up to the spot or they will rattle moose shoulder against the bark of tree so to make sound like the call of the buck which any buck in the neighborhood is sure to take challenge to ﬁght these animals are very quarrelsome creatures and wage ﬁerce battles with one another sometimes using their antlers with such effect that both combatants die from their wounds the deer family is so large that we must content ourselves with brieﬂy mentioning few of its members first we will speak of three of the old world deer and of these they are seen in great britain whose literature has so much to say of them the antlered deer virginian or deer east indian sambar moose european elk east indian jungle deer roe 184 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https wapiti american elk caribou reindeer all are stags the r ed d eer this is the noblest object of the chase in europe the only part of england in which it is now really wild is exmoor where it is still quite plentiful but in many parts of the scottish highlands it is carefully preserved large moorland districts being given up to it under the title of deer forests when the female deer has little fawn to take care of she generally hides it among very tall heather pressing it gently with her nose to make it lie down there it will remain all day long without moving till she returns to it in the evening but she is never very far away and is always ready to come at once to its aid if it should be attacked by fox or wildcat the stag of this animal is good deal larger than the doe and may stand much four feet high at the shoulder while its antlers may be more than three feet long in color it is bright reddish brown which often becomes good deal paler during the winter the f allow d eer this deer is not nearly so big the red deer it is never more than three feet in height while you can also distinguish it by the fact that the antlers are ﬂattened out at the tip into broad plate and that the coat is spotted with white this is the deer which is kept in so many english parks where one may often see herd of hundred or more of the pretty graceful animals moving about together there is always master deer in each of these herds who has won his post by ﬁghting and overcoming all his rivals he does not always remain with the herd but often lives apart weeks together accompanied perhaps by three or four favorite does and in his absence the herd is led by some of the younger bucks but whenever he makes his appearance these make way him and one disputes his sway until he becomes too old and inﬁrm to hold his position any longer the male fallow deer is known by different names at different times of his life in the ﬁrst year he is called fawn in the second year pricket in the third sorrel and in the fourth soare while when he is ﬁve years old he is described buck of the ﬁrst lead and when he is six buck complete the r oebuck this is quite small animal seldom exceeding inches in height at the shoulder in color it is reddish or grayish brown above and grayish white underneath with white patch on the chin and another round the root of the tail the antlers stand nearly upright and throw of f one tine or spur in front and two more behind there is only one part of england where the roebuck is found wild and that is blackmoor vale in dorsetshire but it is common in many of the scottish moors and forests it is never seen in herds like the fallow deer but goes about in pairs although when there are fawns they accompany their parents the roebuck sheds its antlers in december and the new ones are fully develop ed by about the end of february although they are seldom more than eight or nine inches long they are really formidable weapons more especially the deer is very powerful in proportion to its size the bucks are very quarrelsome creatures and ﬁght most savagely with one another while more than once they have been known to attack human beings and to inﬂict

and the is always wanting the most familiar species is the common american deer of which the virginia or deer is the type this deer is found in varying forms in both continents and was regularly hunted by the ancient mexicans with trained pumas the virginia deer found in eastern north america and believed to range far south louisiana stands triﬂe over three feet in height and weighs clean about one hundred and pounds the coloration is chestnut in summer bluish gray in winter the antlers are of good size and usually measure from twenty to inches in length sporting animal the deer is not popular it has been described an exasperating little beast possessing every quality which deer ought not to from the sportsman point of view his haunts are in choking blinding bush and his habits are beastly one could ever expect to stalk if you want to get one you must crawl selous bagged one of these deer somewhat curiously he was coming he writes through the scrubby rather open bush straight toward in series of great leaps rising i think quite four feet from the ground at every bound i stood absolutely still thinking to ﬁre at him just he jumped the stream and passed however he came so straight to that had he held his course he must have jumped on to or over but when little more than the width of the stream separated he was certainly not more than ten yards from either saw or winded and without moment halt made prodigious leap sideways i ﬁred at him when he was in the air and i believe quite six feet above the ground the deer an old buck with good head was afterward picked up dead in different parts of america far south peru and bolivia various local races of this deer are to be found the m ule eer the is found in most parts of north america west of the missouri far south southern california stands about three feet four inches at the shoulder and weighs over two hundred and forty pounds it carries good antlers measuring much thirty inches and in color is tawny red in summer brownish gray in winter it is far better sporting animal than the sneaking deer and affords excellent stalking this deer is still abundant in many localities it is commonly called blacktail but the true blacktail is similar but smaller species conﬁned to the northern paciﬁc coast the w apiti this is the largest and ﬁnest of american deer originally numerous everywhere west of the appalachian mountains but now to be found only in the mountains of the northwest it is much like the european red deer but very much larger and is connected with it by series of stags known the maral shou inhabiting central asia from persia to kamchatka it grazes like cattle rather than browses and in the fall gathers into herds which formerly contained many thousands and spent the winter among sheltering hills marsh eer in south america are to be found several kinds of of which the best known has its range from brazil to the forest country of the argentine republic the is almost equal in size to the red deer of europe but somewhat less stout of build the coloring is bright chestnut in summer brown in winter the coat is long and coarse beﬁts creature the antlers usually display ten points and measure more than twenty inches the p amp eer this species closely allied to the is of small size standing about two feet six inches at the shoulder the antlers usually measure more than from 186 187 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https to fourteen inches in ﬁne specimens the is found from brazil to northern patagonia peruvian and c hilean g uemals these are small deer found on the high andes and are somewhat inferior in size to the virginia deer the males carry simple antlers forming single fork and measuring about nine inches the coat yellowish brown in hue is coarse thick and brittle the chilean guemal is found also in most parts of patagonia unlike the guemal of peru which delights in altitudes of from to feet it lives chieﬂy in deep valleys thick forest and even the adjacent plains to which it resorts in winter brockets of these several species are found in south and central america and trinidad they are small deer having antlers and tufted crowns the largest is the red brocket found in guiana brazil and paraguay which stands inches at the shoulder the body coloring is brownish red like most of the group this brocket is extremely shy but although fond of dense covert it is found also in open patches the pygmy brocket tiny deerlet less than nineteen inches in height found in central brazil is the smallest of these very small deer pudus two other diminutive deer known pudus closely allied to the brockets are found in south america these are the chilean and ecuador pudus of which the form er is only about thirteen inches in height the latter about fourteen or ﬁfteen inches little is known of the history and life habits of these charming little creatures one of which the chilean species has occasionally been seen in zoölogical gardens camels we now come to remarkably interesting animal first let us tell you how wonderfully the camel is suited to life in the desert 188 189 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https pets at the zoo guanaco and young dorcas gazelle bactrian riding camel in the ﬁrst place it has great spreading feet now this is very important if the animal had small hard hoofs like those of the horse or the donkey it would sink deeply into the loose sand at every step and would soon be so tired out that it would be quite unable to travel any farther but its broad splay toes not sink into the sand at all and it can march easily along hour after hour where horse could scarcely travel mile then it can go several weeks with hardly any food all that it ﬁnds it journeys through the desert is mouthful or two of dry thorns and even at the end of the day its master has nothing to give it but few dates and on this meager diet it has to travel forty or ﬁfty miles day with heavy load on its back but then you must remember the camel has hump now this hump consists almost entirely of fat and the animal marches on day after day with scarcely any food this fat passes back by degrees into its system and actually serves nourishment so you see while the camel is traveling through the desert it really lives chieﬂy on its own hump by the time that it reaches its journey end the hump has almost entirely disappear ed little more is left in its place than loose bag of empty skin the animal is then unﬁt work and has to be allowed to graze two or three weeks in rich pasture then day by day the hump ﬁlls out again and when it is ﬁrm and solid once more the camel is ﬁt another journey more wonderful still perhaps is its way of carrying enough water about with it to last several days except the camel typical ruminating animals or those which chew the cud have the stomach divided into four separate compartments through which the food passes in turn these are called the paunch the honeycomb stomach or bag the manyplies and the abomasum in the camel the third of these is wanting and the ﬁrst and second are provided with number of deep cells which can be opened or closed at the will of the the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https these cells the animal is able to store up water when it has the opportunity of drinking it not only quenches its thirst but ﬁlls up all these cells well in this way it can store up quite gallon and half of liquid then when it grows thirsty and can not ﬁnd pool or stream all that it has to is to open one or two of the cells and allow the contents to ﬂow out and so on from time to time until the whole supply is exhausted in this way camel can easily go ﬁve or six days without requiring to drink even when marching under the burning sun of the desert two kinds of camels are known neither of which is now found in wild state arabian c amel the ﬁrst of these is the arabian camel which only has one hump on its back and is so well known that there is need to describe it it is very largely used in many parts of africa and asia beast of both draught and burden camels riding upon however are generally called dromedaries and may be regarded separate breed just hunters are separate breed from and while they will travel with rider upon their backs at pace of eight or nine miles an hour an ordinary camel with load upon its back will scarcely cover third of that distance in the same time this camel is animal it gets very cross when it is made to kneel down to be loaded and crosser still when it has to kneel again in the evening its burden to be removed and all day it goes grunting and snarling and groaning along ready to bite any one who may come near it and it is so stupid that if it wanders off the path yard or two in order to nibble at tempting patch of herbage it goes straight on in the new direction without ever thinking of turning back in order to regain the road besides being used riding and carrying loads the camel is valuable on account of its ﬂesh and also of its milk while its hair is woven into kind of coarse cloth bactrian c amel this camel which comes from central asia has two humps on its back instead of one it is not quite so tall the arabia n animal and is more stoutly and strongly built while its hair is much longer and more shaggy these reasons it is very useful in rocky and hilly country it can scramble about hours on steep and stony ground without getting tired while its thick coat protects it from the cold llamas llamas may be described south american camels but they are much smaller than the true camels and have humps on their backs and their feet are not nearly so broad and while their thick wool ly coat grows in dense masses which sometimes reach almost to the ground there are four kinds of llamas but we can only tell you about one of them the guanaco this animal lives both among the mountains and in the plains it is generally found in ﬂocks consisting of single male and from twelve to ﬁfteen females but sometimes the ﬂocks are much larger and more than once several hundred animals have been seen together the male always keeps behind the ﬂock and if he notices any sign of danger he utters curious whistling cry the does know exactly what this means and at once take to ﬂight while the male follows stopping every now and then to look back and see if they are being pursued usually when two male guanacos meet they ﬁght biting one another most savagely and squealing loudly with rage when one of these animals is killed its skin is likely to be found deeply scored by the wounds it has received from its numerous antagonists if you go to look at the llamas in zoo we would advise you not to stand too near the bars of their enclosure they have habit of spitting straight into one face when they are used riding they will often turn their heads round and spit at their rider just to show that they are getting tired and if once they lie down amount of persuasion or 190 191 192 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of beating will make them get up again until they consider that they have had proper rest zebras there are three different kinds of these beautiful animals the largest and ﬁnest is known grévy zebra which is found in the mountains of somaliland it has many more stripes than the other two while the ground color is quite white the smallest is the mountain zebra which is only about big pony and has its legs striped right down to the hoofs this is now very scarce animal being only found in one or two mountainous districts in south africa where one is allowed to interfere with it and between the two is the burchell zebra which is about large small horse and has its legs white with only very few markings this animal is quite common in many parts of the south african plains and has often been domesticated and taught to draw carriages and carts indeed in some districts of southern africa coach drawn by team of zebras instead of horses is not very uncommon sight you would think that an animal colored like the zebra would be very easily seen even by night would you but strange to say these creatures are almost invis ible from distance of even few yards indeed hunters say that they have often been so close to zebra at night that they could hear him breathing yet have been quite unable to see him this seems to be due to his stripes it has been found that while pony can be easily seen from forty or ﬁfty yards away on moonlight night it at once becomes invisible if it is clothed with ribbons in such way to resemble the stripes of the zebra zebras are generally found in herds and they have curious habit of traveling about in company with number of brindled gnus and ostriches which all seem to be friendly possible together the q uagga the quagga which became extinct some time ago never had very extended range but once it existed in great numbers on all the upland plains of cape colony to the west of the kei river and in the open treeless country lying between the orange and vaal rivers north of the vaal it appears to have been unknown the quagga seems to have been nearly allied to burchell to the most southerly form of that ut was much darker in general color instead of being striped over the whole body it was only strongly banded on the head and neck the dark brown stripes becoming fainter on the shoulders and dying away in spots and blotches on the other hand in size and build in the appearance of its mane ears and tail and in general habits it seems to have nearly resembled its handsomer relative the barking neigh seems too to have been the same in both species the dutch word quagga is pronounce d in south africa and is of hottentot origin an imitation of the animal neighing call burchell zebras are invariably called by both boers and british colonists wild sses the true asses are without stripes on the head neck and body with the exception of dark streak down the back from the mane to the tail which is present in all members of the group and in some cases dark band across the shoulders and irregular markings on the legs in africa the wild ass is only found in the desert regions of the northeastern portion of that continent it is ﬁne animal standing between thirteen and fourteen hands at the shoulder it lives in small herds or famil ies of four or ﬁve individuals and is not found in mountainous districts but frequents low stony hills and arid desert wastes it is general rule an alert animal and difﬁcult to approach and so ﬂeet and enduring that excepting in the case of foals and mares heavy in young it can not be overtaken even by horseman notwithstanding the scanty nature of the herbage in the districts 193 194 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https frequent these asses are always in good condition they travel long distances to water at night but appear to require to drink regularly their ﬂesh is eaten by the natives of the soudan the bray of the african wild ass it is said can not easily be distinguished from that of the domest icated animal which is undoubtedly descended from this breed in asia three varieties of the wild ass are found which were formerly believed to represent three distinct species but all the local races of the asiatic wild ass are now considered to belong to one species and it is to them that reference is made in the description on pages 196 and these wild asses have wide range and are met with from syria to persia and western india and northward throughout the more arid portions of central asia like their african relatives the wild asses of asia are inhabitants of waste places frequenting desert plains and steppes they are said to be ﬂeet and enduring the others the wild asses of the desert plains of india and persia are said to be very wary and difﬁcult to approach but the kiang of tibet is always spoken of much more conﬁding animal its curiosity being so great that it will frequently approach to within short distance of any unfamiliar object such sportsman engaged in stalking other game asiatic wild asses usually live in small families of four or ﬁve but sometimes congregate in herds their food consists of various grasses in the portions of their range but of woody plants on the high plateaus where little else is to be obtained of wild asses in general the late sir samuel baker once said those who have seen donkeys only in their civilized state can have conception of the wild or original animal it is the perfection of activity and courage the h orse like the wild camels genuine wild horses are very generally believed to be extinct the vast herds which occur in wild state in europe america and australia are to be regarded say those who believe in the extinction theory descended from domesticated animals which have run wild so far the american and australian horses are concerned this is doubt true but of the european stocks it is by means so certain however without giving you any theory of our own we will quote at some length from an interesting and instructive chapter on the horse by buckley there rose before my mind the level pampas of south america where wild horses share the boundless plains with troops of the rhea or american ostrich and wander each horse with many mares he can collect in companies of hundreds or even thousands in troop these horses are now truly wild and live freely from youth to age unless they are unfortunate enough to be caught in the more inhabited regions by the lasso of the hunter in the broad pampas the home of herds of wild cattle they dread nothing there they roam with one bold stallion their leader even beast s of prey hesitate to approach them when they form into dense mass with the mothers and young in their center their heels deal blows which even the ﬁerce jaguar does not care to encounter and they trample their enemy to death in very short time yet these are not the original wild horses they are the descendants of tame animals brought from europe by the spaniards to buenos aires in 1535 whose descendants have regained their freedom on the boundless pampas and prairies i was picturing them careering over the plains another scene presented itself and took their place now i longer saw around tall with the long necks of the rheas appearing above it i was on the edge of dreary scantily covered plain between the aral sea and the balkash lake in tartary to the south lies barren sandy desert to the north the fertile plains of the kirghiz steppes where the tartar feeds his ﬂocks and herds of antelopes gallop over the fresh green pasture and between these is kind of land where low scanty shrubs and stunted grass seem to promise but poor 195 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https yet here the small but powerful tarpans the wild horses of the treeless plains of russia and tartary were picking their morning meal sturdy wicked little fellows they are with their shaggy coats short wiry manes erect ears and ﬁery watchful eyes they might well be supposed to be true wild horses whose ancestors had never been tamed by man and yet it is more probable that even they escaped in early times from the tartars and have held their own ever since over the grassy steppes of russia and on the conﬁnes of the plains of tartary sometimes they live almo st alone especially on the barren wastes where they have been seen in winter scraping the snow off the herbage at other times in the south of russia where they wander between the dnieper and the don they gather in vast herds and live free life not fearing even the wolves which they beat to the ground with their hoofs from one green oasis to another they travel over miles of ground thousand none to ride with ﬂowing tail and ﬂying mane wide stretched by pain mouths bloodless to the bit or rein and feet that iron never shod and ﬂanks unscarred by spur or rod thousand horse the wild the free like waves that follow the sea byron mazeppa wild rela tives of the horse northern or grévy zebra abyssinian ass southern or burchell zebra przwalsky horse i followed them in their course i fancied i saw troops of yet another animal of the horse tribe the kulan or equus hemionus which is kind of half horse half ass living on the kirghiz steppes of tartary and spreading far beyond the range of the tarpan into tibet here at last we have truly wild animal never probably brought into subjection by man the number of names he possesses shows how widely he has spread the tartars 196 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https him kulan the tibetans kiang while the mongolians give him the unpronounceable name of dschiggetai he will not submit to any of them but if caught and conﬁned soon breaks away again to his old life and fetterless creature one has ever yet settled the question whether he is horse or an ass probably because he represents an animal truly between the two his head is graceful his body light his legs slender and ﬂeet yet his ears are long and he has narrow hoofs and tail with tuft at the end like all the ass tribe his color is yellow brow n and he has short dark mane and long dark stripe down his back donkey has living often on the high plateaus sometimes much ﬁfteen hundred feet above the sea this of the steppes travels in large companies even far the rich meadows of central asia in summer wandering in green pastures and in winter seeking the hunger es where sturdy plants grow and when autum n comes the young steeds go off alone to the mountain heights to survey the country around and call wildly mates whom when found they will keep close to them through all the next year even though they mingle with thousands of others till recent years the equus hemionus was the only truly wild horse known but in the winter of the russian traveler przhevalsky brought back from central asia much more animal called by the tartars kertag and by the mongols statur it is clumsy creature with strong legs and large heavy colored head its legs have red tint down to the knees beyond which they are blackish down to the hoofs but the ears are small and it has the broad hoofs of the true horse and warts on the hind legs which animal of the ass tribe has this horse like the kiang travels in small troops of from ﬁve to ﬁfteen led through the wildest parts of the dsungarian desert between the altai and mountains by an old stallion they are extremely shy and see hear and smell very quickly so that they are off like lightning whenever anything approaches them so having traveled over america europe and asia was my quest ended from the dreary asiatic deserts my thoughts wandered to far warmer and more fertile land where between the blue nile and the red sea rise the lofty highlands of abyssinia among which the african wild ass the probable ancestor of our donkeys feeds in troops on the rich grasses of the slopes and then onward to the bank of river in central africa where on the edge of forest with rich pastures beyond elephants and rhinoceroses antelopes and buffaloes lions and hyena s creep down in the cool of the evening to slake their thirst in the ﬂowing stream there i saw the herds of zebras in all their striped beauty coming down from the mountain regions to the north and mingling with the darker but graceful quaggas from the southern plains and i half griev ed at the thought how these untamed and free rovers are being slowly but surely surrounded by man closing in upon them on every side i might now have traveled still farther in search of the onager or wild ass of the asiatic and indian deserts but at this point more interesting and far wider question presented itself i ﬂung myself down on the moor to ponder over the early history of all these tribes where have they all come from where shall we look the ﬁrst ancestors of these wild and graceful animals the answer to this question i had to trave l back to america to those western united states where professor marsh has made such grand discoveries in horse history there in the very country where horses were supposed never to have been before the spaniards brought them few centuries ago we have now found the true birthplace of the equine race come back with to time so remote that we can not measure it even by hundred of thousands of years and let us visit the territories of utah and wyoming those highlands were very different then from what they are now just risen out of the seas of the cretaceous period they were then clothed with dense forests of palms and magnolias and laurels interspersed with lakes on the margins of which strange and curious animals fed and ﬂourished there were large beasts with teeth like the tapir and the bear and feet like the elephant and others far more dangerous half bear half hyena prowl ing around to attack the clumsy paleotherium or 197 198 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https anoplotherium something between rhinoceros and horse which grazed by the waterside while graceful antelopes fed on the rich grass and among these were some little animals bigger than foxes with four toes and splint the ﬁfth on their front feet and three toes on the hind ones these clumsy little animals whose bones have been found in the rocks of utah and wyoming have been called eohippus or horse of the dawn by naturalists they were animals with real toes yet their bones and teeth show that they belonged to the horse tribe and already the ﬁfth toe common to most other toed animals was beginning to disappear this was in the eocene period and before it passed away with its and another rather larger animal called orohippus had taken the place of the small one and he had only four toes on his front feet the splint had disappeared and time went on still other animals followed always with fewer toes while they gained slender ﬂeet legs together with an increase in size and in gracefulness first one large sheep mesohippus had only three toes and splint then the splint again disappeared and one large and two dwindling toes only remained till ﬁnally these two became mere splints leaving one large toe or hoof with almost imperceptible splints which may be seen on the fetlock of horse skeleton you must notice that horse foot really begins at the point which we call his knee in the front legs and at his hock in his hind legs his true knee and elbow are close up to the body what we call his foot or hoof is really the end of the strong broad middle toe covered with hoof and farther up his foot we can feel two small splints which are remains of two other toes meanwhile during these long succeeding ages while the foot was lengthening out into slender limb the animals became larger more powerful and more swift the neck and head became longer and more graceful the larger in front and the teeth decreased in number so that there is now large gap between the biting teeth and the grinding teeth of horse their slender limbs too became more ﬂexible and ﬁt running and galloping till we ﬁnd the whole skeleton the same in shape though not in size in our own horses and asses now they did not however during all this time remain conﬁned to america from the time when they arrived at an animal called miohippus or lesser horse which came after mesohippus and had only three toes on each foot we ﬁnd their remains in europe where they lived in company with the giraffes opossums and monkeys which roamed over these parts in those ancient times then little later we ﬁnd them in africa and india so that the horse tribe represented by creatures about large donkeys had spread far and wide over the world and now curiously enough they began to forsake or to die out in the land of their birth why they did so we not know but while in the old world asses quaggas and zebras and probably horses they ﬂourished in asia europe and africa they certainly died out in america so that ages afterward when that land was discovered animal of the horse tribe was found in it and the true horse where did he arise born and bred probably in central asia from some animal like the kulan or the kertag he proved too useful to savage tribes to be allowed his freedom and it is doubtful whether in any part of the world he escaped subjection in england he probably roamed wild animal till the savages who fed upon him learned in time to put him to work and when the romans came they found the britons with ﬁne and horses yet though tamed and made to know his master he has we have seen broken loose again in almost all parts of the america on the prairies and pampas in europe and asia on the steppes and in australia in the bush and even in great britain where so few patches of uncultivated land still remain the young colts of dartmoor exmoor and shetland though born of domesticated mothers seem to assert their descent from wild and free ancestors they throw out their heels and toss up their heads with shrill neigh and ﬂy against the wind with streaming manes and outstretched tails the kulan the tarpan and the zebra in the wild desert or grassy plain 199 200 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https xvii the elephants rhinoceroses hippopot amuses and wild swine there are three reasons perhaps why elephants interest us so greatly the ﬁrst is their enormous size they are by far the largest of all the animals which live upon land jumbo instance the famous african elephant that we in the united states saw in the last century was nearly twelve feet in height and weighed more than six tons height of ten feet is quite common next there is their wonderful docility when wild doubt they are often very ﬁerce and savage yet they are easily tamed and it is strange sight to see one of these giant creatures walking about with load of children upon its back and meekly obeying the lightest word of man whom it could crush to death in moment by simply placing its foot upon him and then once more there is that marvelous trunk so strong that it can tear down great branches from the trees and yet so delicate that it can pick up the smalles t scrap of food from the ground when the elephant wishes to feed it seizes the food with its trunk and pokes it into its mouth when it wishes to drink it ﬁlls the same organ with water and then squirts the contents down its throat if it should be hot it can take shower by squirting water over its body instead and it breathes through its trunk and smells with it well so this wonderful member is used great many dif ferent purposes it is so valuable the elephant takes very great care of its trunk always curling it up out of harm way example if it should ﬁnd itself in any danger two different kinds of elephants are known one of which is found in africa and the other in asia the frican lephant you can easily tell the african elephant by the great size of his ears which are so large that man might almost hide himself behind one of them jumbo ear indeed measured less than ﬁve feet ﬁve inches from side to side when the animal is excited these enormous ears stand out at right angles to the head then the legs are much longer than those of the indian elephant while the trunk instead of having one ﬁnger projection at the tip has two one in front and one behind both the male and female animal rule possess tusks while in indian elephants these weapons are only occasionally present in the male and hardly ever in the female the tusks of the male elephant however are always much larger than those of his mate and sometimes they grow to very great size length of nine feet is not very uncommon while tusks ten feet long or even more have sometimes been recorded generally one tusk is several inches shorter than the other having been worn down in digging the roots on which the animal is fond of feeding elephants seem to dig with one of the tusks only and never with both the ivory of which these tusks are composed is so valuable that the african elephant has been most terribly persecuted and in many districts where it was formerly plentiful it has disappeared altogether it lives rule in herds which seek the thickest parts of the forest during the day and come out at night to search food and water and even small herd of elephants will sometimes great deal of damage they will uproot trees eighteen or even twenty feet high in order to feed upon the foliage of the upper branches or snap off the stems quite close to the ground when the tree is large one it is said that two elephants will unite in breaking it down 201 202 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https would think that herd of elephants would be very conspicuous even in the thick forest would you yet all hunters unite in saying that long they remain still it is almost impossible to see them while they make their way through the bushes so silently that even when they are moving it is not at all easy to hear them the i ndian lephant this elephant seldom exceeds nine feet in height at the shoulder although larger examples are sometimes found it lives in the thick jungle in herds of forty or ﬁfty which sometimes wander by night into cultiva ted ground and terrible damage to the crops now and then however male elephant will live entirely alone these solitary animals are always very ﬁerce and will rush out and attack any one who may pass by this reason they are known rogues the indian elephant is very often tamed and is taught to perform all kinds of heavy work such dragging timber or piling logs it is also used riding howdah with several seats being placed upon its back while it is guided by native driver called mahout who sits upon its neck and directs its movements by means of spiked hook it is largely employed too in hunting the tiger but this purpose it has to be most carefully trained elephants are naturally very much afraid of tigers and even after long course of instruction will sometime s take to ﬂight when the furious animal springs at them with open jaws and eyes ﬂaming with rage elephants in india are mostly captured by being driven into large keddah or enclosure of stout posts from which they are unable to make their escape in this way large herd of the huge animals are often taken prisoners together next in size to the elephants are the great creatures known rhinoceroses which are found both in africa and in asia five different kinds are known altogether but we shall only be able to tell you about two the i ndian r hinoceros in this animal the hide falls into great folds upon the shoulders and in front of the thighs while there are smaller folds upon the neck and the hind quarters the sides of the body are marked with large number of round projection s sometimes much an inch in diameter which look very much like the rivets in the iron plates of boiler when fully grown this animal stands rather over ﬁve feet in height at the shoulder the indian rhinoceros has only one horn which is generally about foot long this horn strange to say is not connected in any way with the bones of the skull but is really growth from the skin although there is bony prominence under it on which it is set by means of sharp knife it could be cut away without difﬁculty but it is very formidable weapon and some of the rhinoceroses with longer horns have been known to rush at mounted hunter with lowered head and then to strike upward with such terrible force that the horn has actually pierced the horse body and entered the thigh of the rider sometimes rhinoceros will rush along with its head bent downward so far that the horn cuts deep furrow in the ground this animal is chieﬂy found in the swampy parts of the great of india it is very fond of taking from which it comes out with its whole body thickly caked with clay this serves great protection from ﬂies and other insects which persecute it terribly forcing their way under the thick folds of hide at the shou lders and thighs where the skin is thinner and driving it nearly mad by the irritation of their bites in spite of its great size this rhinoceros is rather timid animal and nearly always runs away when it is attacked but if it is wounded or brought to bay it becomes terrible foe charging with fury again and again and striking savagely with its horn and sometimes with its tusks well the african rhinoceroses are without the folds of skin which are found in the indian species and have two horns on the head instead of one sometimes these horns are of very great length we have seen that might serve very tall man which was cut from the core of such horn 203 204 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https c ommon r hinoceros this is the better known of the two african species and is found in almost all the wilder districts from abyssinia to cape colony it lives in the thickest parts of the forest breaking away the bushes and the lower branches of the trees so to leave clear space perhaps ﬁfteen or twenty feet in diameter these retreats are called and the animals remain in them during the heat of the day the common rhinoceros is wonderfully quick and active so large and heavy an animal and is said to be able to overtake man riding fast horse but it does not seem rule to be savage in disposition and very seldom attacks human foe one great hunter tells us that although many rhinoceroses have advanced toward him to within twenty or thirty yards they always ran away if he threw stones at them or even if he waved his arms and shouted when wounded however they will sometim es attack furiously but they never think of looking their enemy in tree and if he can climb on to bough even three or four feet from the ground he is perfectly safe the h yrax oddly enough one of the animals most closely related to the rhinoceroses is much more like rabbit and actually lives in burrows in the ground this is the hyrax or coney it is called in the bible which almost anybody would mistake at ﬁrst sight rodent yet when one comes to look at its front teeth he sees at once that instead of having ﬂat sharp edges like chisel they are pointed and these teeth not continue to grow all through life like those of the rodent animals and besides this there are several other points in its bodily structure which show us that it really is relation of the rhinoceroses about fourteen different kinds of hyrax are known some of which are found in africa and the others in arabia syria and palestine they all live in rocky districts high up on the sides of mountains great number making their burrows close to one another just rabbits in warren they are very active and sure of foot and scamper up and down the sides of the rocks with the greatest ease it is difﬁcult to watch them however they are so shy that they will not leave their holes if they think that any one can see them while they only come out to feed at night and very early in the morning sometimes it is true they will lie out on the rocks during the day enjoying the hot sunshine but one of them is always appointed to act sentinel and soon he notices the slightest sign of danger he gives the alarm and then they all disap pear into their holes pachyderms and tapir african elephant african rhinoceros east african hippopotamus malayan tapir tapirs 205 206 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https animals are the tapirs which are found both in central and south america and also in some of the islands of the malay archipelago they are about large donkeys but look more like very big pigs on the neck is short stiff upright mane of black hairs and the upper lip is lengthened out into kind of trunk something like that of an elephant but on very much smaller scale and without the odd ﬁnger organ at the tip these curious animals live in thick forests near the banks of great rivers and come out from their retreats chieﬂy by night by constantly traveling backward and forward they make regular pathways through the thickets they swim very well and are fond of gamboling in the water and also of rolling about on the muddy banks but they are so timid that it is very difﬁcult to watch them and it is said that they will run away in terror from even tiny dog but if mother tapir thinks that her little one is in danger she seems to lose all sense of fear and will even dash at man and try to knock him down and if she succeeds she will trample upon him and even bite him just like the wild swine in america the great enemy of the tapirs is the jaguar which springs upon them unexpectedly and generally succeeds in tearing them to the ground but sometimes they manage to escape either by rushing at once into the very thickest bushes which sweep away their terrible enemy from his hold or else by plunging into the water when he is obliged to loose his grip fear of being drowned the american tapirs are sooty brown in color but that which is found in the malayan islands is white on the sides and the hinder parts of the body while the young animal is spotted and streaked with white all over the h ippopot amus the hippopotamus or is perhaps the most awkward and ungainly animal in the world his huge body almost touches the ground he waddles clums ily along while his short stout legs are set so far apart that they actually make double track through the herbage so you can easily understand that when herd of twenty or thirty of these enormous creatures ﬁnd their way into plantation they terrible damage eating good deal and trampling down far more than they eat then what tremendous mouths they have when they open their jaws wide their heads really look if they were splitting in two right down into their necks and they have most formidable array of tusks and teeth arranged in such manner that they mow down the herbage almost like the blade of scythe the hippopotamus is native of africa and is found in great numbers in many of the rivers and lakes it spends great deal of its time in the water often sinking its body so low that only its nostrils appear above the surface and it can dive eight or even ten minutes at time without requiring to breathe when it rises again it generally begins to blow out the exhausted air from its lungs just before reaching the surface whereby column of spray is forced up into the air just it is by whale when spouting when mother hippopotamus has little one she generally carries it about on her back writer tells us that the ﬁrst hippopotam us that was ever brought to the londo n zoo was caught when it was quite young on one of the islands in the white nile its mother had gone away to feed the hunter who found it picked it up in his arms and ran off with it toward the boat the skin of these animals however is thickly covered with kind of natural oil and the result was that the little creature was so slippery that it wriggled out of his arms just he reached the water edge and plunged into the river but luckily the was lying close by and with this he struck at the escaping animal gaffed it one does ﬁsh and succeeded in capturing it again with nothing more than wound in its thick skin which very soon healed after great deal of trouble it was safely brought to england and lived in the zoo years another kind of hippopotamus called the pygmy hippopotamus is found in western africa it is very much smaller animal being only about big pig 207 208 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https next on our list come the swine among the most famous of which is the wild boar until about the middle of the sixteenth century this animal was plentiful in the british isles and it is still found commonly in the great forests of europe it is one of the ﬁercest and most savage of animals it does not seem to know what fear is and will attack over and over again even after receiving the most severe wounds and its tusks are so sharp and powerful that they have been known to rip up the body of horse at single stroke when removed from the jaw these tusks are generally about eight or nine inches long in india where wild boars are very plentiful they generally make their lair among thick bushes in some marshy district and often great deal of mischief to cultivated crops in the neighborhood they are fond of roots too which they grub out of the ground with their snouts and in hot summers when the ponds dry up they are said to dig in the mud at the bottom in search of the ﬁsh which have buried themselves until the rainy season the old boars generally live by themselves like rogue elephants but the younger ones and the sows go about together in droves of ﬁfteen or twenty all of which most likely are members of the same family the b abirusa this is one of the most curious of the swine it is found in the islands of celebes and borneo in the boar of this animal the tusks in both jaws spring upward and then curve toward the eyes so that there is sort of fringe it were of tusks all round the face sometimes the upper pairs are thirteen or fourteen inches long without counting the part that is buried in the jaw these however are not very useful weapons but very severe wounds can be inﬂicted by the lower tusks although they are good deal smaller and an enraged babirusa is most formidable foe when fully grown the babirusa stands about three feet six inches in height in the middle of the back which is always very much arched the color of the skin is dark ashy gray the w art og the or which is found in eastern africa is certainly the ugliest of all the swine its head is enormously large in comparison with its body the muzzle is very long and broad under each eye is great lump with two others little distance below it and on each side of the mouth two great stout tusks spring upward altogether it would be very hard to imagine more sullen and animal it is not nearly so savage the babirusa however and if it is attacked it nearly always runs away and tries to take refuge in some hole in the ground such the deserted burrow of an when it takes to ground in this way it always turns round just before entering and backs in tail foremost sometimes if two or three men stand just over the burrow and jump heavily up and down in time together it can be induce d to bolt but it is advisable to so with good deal of caution the animal has singular way of turning kind of back somersault just it leaves its burrow which lands it upon the top just where the hunters would most likely be standing and if they are not very careful one of them at least is almost sure to receive slashing cut from the terrible tusks which will certainly cause severe wound and may even render him cripple life when it is running away from pursuer and wishes to see whether it is gaining upon him the presents most ridiculous appearance its neck is so short that it can not turn its head round to look behind it so it lifts its snout straight up into the air instead and looks over its shoulders besides this it always carries its tail perfectly stiff and upright peccaries 209 210 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https south america and in mexico and western texas the wild swine are represented by the peccaries of which there are two different kinds the collared peccary and the less common peccary they are not very large animals being only about three feet in length and weighing not more than ﬁfty or sixty pounds but they are nevertheless very dangerous creatures three dif ferent reasons in the ﬁrst place they travel about in packs sometimes consisting of thirty or forty animals which all attack foe together in the second place although their tusks are not nearly so long those of the preceding animals they are almost sharp razors and can inﬂict most terrible wounds third ly the animals know fear and will go on savagely attacking any enemy over and over again until the last of them is killed so if hunter should meet with herd of peccaries in the forest even if he be armed with gun his only chance of escape is to climb into tree and to stay there till they go away when herd of peccaries is not very perhaps of only ten or twelve are very fond of taking up their abode in the hollow trunk of some fallen tree in this case they can be very easily destroyed one animal is always placed at the entrance to act sentinel and if hunter conceals himself in some convenient place close by takes careful aim and shoots the watching peccary dead upon the spot the animal behind him will just push out his carcass and take his place to be himself shot in like manner in this way the whole herd may be killed one after another peccaries will eat almost any kind of food and though they live rule in the thickest parts of the forests they will often wander to long distances in order to feed upon the crops in cultivated ground there they sometimes an immense amount of damage and they generally come during the night and leave again before daybreak it is very difﬁcult to trap or shoot them chapter xviii edent ates or toothless mammals the animals which belong to this order are distinguished by having front teeth while some of them have teeth at all and in many other ways they are very curious and interesting creatures sloths the sloths live almost entirely in the trees scarcely ever descending to the ground not only that they walk along underneath the branches instead of upon them suspending themselves by means of their great hooked claws so they actually spend almost the whole of their lives upside down with their backs toward the ground yet they manage to travel along from bough to bough and from tree to tree with some little speed and when there is high wind so that the branches are blown together they will often wander long distances and they never seem to get tired although even during the night they still hang suspended just they during the day sloths are very creatures and if you were to see one of them hanging from bough in its native forests you would ﬁnd it rather hard to believe that it was really an animal at all it looks much more like bundle of twigs overgrown with lichens and the strange thing is that it really is covered with lichens which grow upon its long coarse hairs just they on the twigs of the trees these give the fur of the sloth curious green appearance whic h disappears soon after death so that one never sees it in stuf fed specimen in museum when sloth is hungry there is always plenty of food close by it feeds only upon the leaves and fruits and the tender young shoots of trees and there is plenty of 211 212 213 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https in these it never requires to drink at all there are two different groups of these singular animals the ﬁrst consisting of those which have three toes on the front feet and the other of those which have only two they are only found in the great forests of central and south america aters equally curious although in quite different way are the or they are sometimes called the lar gest of which is the great of tropical america when fully grown this animal is about four feet long without counting the tail while it is about two feet high at the shoulder and it has two strange peculiarities in the ﬁrst place its head is drawn out into kind of long narrow beak with the little round nostrils at the very tip then its tongue is very long and and is exceedingly sticky so that when it is swept to and fro among number of ants or other small insects hundreds of them adhere to it and are carried into the mouth this is the way in which the animal feeds and if you go to look the in zoo you may often see it poke its long tongue down between the boards at the bottom of its cage and bring up cockroach which had vainly been seeking place of refuge the other peculiarity is the enormous size of the tail the hair of which is so long that when it is carried over the back it completely covers the whole of the body and makes the animal look just like haycock on its front feet the great has very strong curved claws with which it tears open the nests of the insects on which it feeds when it is walking of course these claws are rather in its way and it is obliged to tread on the sides of its feet instead of on the soles but it manages nevertheless to shufﬂe along with some little speed although its movements are very far from being graceful and sometimes it uses them weapons while it always tries to hug an enemy with its powerful forearms and squeeze him to death the claws often enter his body and inﬂict serious or even fatal wound when mother has little one to take care of she always carries it about on her back and only allows it to get down just now and then in order to feed there is another kind of called the tamandua which lives in the trees and has prehensile tail just like that of spider it is much smaller than the great and has shorter and stouter head while its tail is scarcely bushy that of persian cat in color it is yellowish white with broad black patch which runs from the neck to the hind quarters and then widens out so to cover the whole of the ﬂanks the tip of the snout is also black the animal like the preceding is native of tropical america the rmadillos these are remarkable having their bodies almost entirely covered by kind of natural armor which consists of several bony plates growing in the skin there are three of these plates altogether one covering the head and shoulders another prote cting the back while the third clothes the hind quarters and they are fastened together by means of bony rings so that when the animal rolls itself into ball gap is left betw een them you know what millepede or looks like when it rolls itself up you well imagine big football and you will have very good idea of an armadillo these animals not appear to be in the least inconvenienced by their singular armor and are able to run with considerable speed they are able to dig very well too by means of the large and powerful claws with which their front feet are furnished and it is said that if man on horseback sees an armadillo running by his side and leaps to the ground to secure it he will nearly always ﬁnd that it has succeeded in burying itself before he is able to seize it the armadillo is so called because the horny plate upon its back is broken up into six separate bands all of which however are closely linked together by bony 214 215 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https sometimes it is called the armadillo because its head is thought to be rather like that of weasel it is about sixteen inches in length without including the tail and is found in brazil and paraguay the giant armadillo is very much larger growing to the length of nearly yard from the tip of the snout to the root of the tail it lives in brazil and surinam and feeds chieﬂy on ants and termites one of the most interesting of these creatures is the odd little pichiciago which is only about ﬁve inches long and has pink shield upon its back and fur of snowy white it is found in the western parts of the argentine republic in open sandy places but nowhere seems to be very plentiful it digs in most curious manner first of all it scratches away minute or two with its front feet just to loosen the soil then supporting itself partly on its front feet and partly on its tail it uses the hind feet with the most astonishing rapidity so that it sinks down into the ground if by magic and strange to say it does not leave its burrow open behind it when it has gone in but carefully closes the entrance ramming the earth hard by means of the bony shield at the end of its body pangolins among other animals called are the pangolins which are more remarkable still they are called scaly because their heads bodies and tails are covered with large pointed oval scales which overlap one another very much like the tiles on the roof of house when they are alarmed they coil themselves up into balls just most of the armadillos and their muscles are so wonderfully strong that it is quite impossible to unroll them seven different kinds of pangolins are known four of which live in africa and three in asia they all feed chieﬂy upon ants and termites which they catch by break ing down the walls of their nests and licking up the insects with their long tongues they run about in confusion they live either in crevices among rocks or else in burrows which they dig themselves in the ground sometimes these burrows are of very great size that of the indian pangolin often running ten or twelve feet downwar d into the ground and having at the end at least ﬁve or six feet in diameter when pangolin comes to the edge of an overhanging rock and wishes to descend to the ground below it coils itself up into ball and then rolls over alighting on the edges of its scales just hedgehog does upon its spines in this way it can drop ten or ﬁfteen feet without receiving any injury the different species of pangolin vary good deal in size but the largest of them the giant pangolin is between four and ﬁve feet long when fully grown including the tail the ard ark this name means and has been given to the animal by the boers of south africa because in general appearance it is rather like pig but then it has ears like those of hare and muzzle and tongue like those of an while all its feet are furnished with long and stout claws so that altogether it is very creature the feeds entirely upon termites and ants and is nearly always to be found where the nests of those insects are plentiful it digs with great rapidity and is said to be able to burrow into the ground faster than man armed with spade can dig it out so it has difﬁculty in tearing hole through the walls of the termites and ants nests and then it licks out the insects in thousands during the daytime the is hardly ever to be seen it lies fast asleep in its burrow which it seldom leaves till after sunset before digging this burrow it mostly scoops out quite number of ones scraping hole two or three feet in depth and then leaving it and beginning on another why it does this nobody seems to know 216 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https former days it was thought that the lion and the elephant were in the habit of hunting the together the elephant ﬂooding its burrow by means of stream of water from his trunk and the lion pouncing upon the animal it ran out when fully grown the is rather over six feet in total length about one third of which is occupied by the tail the body is very heavily and clumsily built and the back is good deal arched in the middle in color it is yellowish brown with tinge of red on the back and sides while the lower surface is rather paler chapter xix the marsupials the last order of mammals is very curious one in most of the animals which belong to it there is large pouch on the lower part of the body of the female in which she carries her little ones about several weeks or even several months after they are born that is why these creatures are called marsupials marsupial means pouched even after the little animals are quite able to take care of themselves they will hurry back to their mother and jump into her pouch in moments of danger it is quite true that in good many marsupials this pouch is wanting but traces of it are almost always to be found although sometimes they are so slight that only very careful observer would be likely to notice them in earlier days marsupial animals lived in almost all parts of the world there are very few countries in which their fossil remains have not been discovered but now they are almost entirely restricted to australia the only exceptions being the opossum s which are found in america kangaroos the largest and in some respects the most interesting of the marsupials are the kangaroos in some ways they are rather like gigantic hares but their front legs are so much smaller than the hinder ones that they can not run on all fours but travel by means of series of leaps skipping about in fact instead of running and besides this they have very long and stout tails which serve to support them when they are sitting upright and also help them to balance their bodies when they are leaping the male kangaroo which is often known the boomer or the old man is very much larger than the female sometimes attaining to total length of eight feet six inches or even nine feet nearly half of which is occupied by the tail but when he is sitting upright he is nearly tall tall man the female is about two feet shorter although it is obliged to hop along instead of running the kangaroo is very swift animal and can only be run down by fast and powerful dogs at every leap it covers about ﬁfteen feet of ground the distances between the holes which its great claws make in the ground being regular if they had been marked out with these huge claws are very formidable weapons and the kangaroo well knows how to use them rule it is very timid animal and when it is attacked its ﬁrst idea is always to seek safety in ﬂight but if it is driven to bay it takes up its post with its back against tree so that it can not be approached from behind and quietly awaits the onslau ght of its enemies then soon one of them comes within reach it kicks suddenly out with one of its hind feet delivering its stroke with such force that the great sharp claw has been known to rip up the body of large dog from end to end and to stretch the poor beast dying upon the ground this reason hounds which are used in are made to wear collars of twisted steel chain to protect them from the stroke of their quarry 217 218 219 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https too when hunted kangaro ﬁnds that it can not escape simply by speed it will wade into pool or river wait till the dogs swim up to it and then seize them with its fore limbs one after another and hold them under water till they are drowned although they are not large these front limbs are wonderfully strong and if even powerful man were to be embraced by them he would ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to make his escape the female kangaroo however is not nearly so well able to defend herself and sometimes she has been known when chased by hounds to lie down and die simply from fear but sometimes she escapes by taking sudden leap sideways into thick bushes lying perfectly still until her pursuers have rushed past her and then making off in the opposite direction the mother kangaroo hops about the head of her little one or joey it is called may often be seen poking out of her pouch and she is so clever that if an enemy should appear when the joey is playing on the ground or feeding she will snatch it up and put it into her pouch even while she is hopping away without pausing moment in her retreat types of marsupials australian sugar squirrel american opossum australian echidna australian great kangaroo tasmanian devil j oyous m eeting kangaroos are very affectionate animals and touching story is told of couple which lived together in captivity they became the very best of friends but when they were sent from australia to philadelphia they had to travel by different ships soon they were separated they became misera ble moping in their cages refusing to take food and calling each other all day long jack the male was called reached philadelphia ﬁrst and whole week seemed to be constantly on the watch to see if flora his mate was coming at last she arrived and both animals at once became madly excited leaping in their cages so wildly that at last they were put together to prevent them from injuring themselves against the bars then they cuddled up against one another licked each other with their tongues and seemed so overjoyed to meet that the keeper promised that they should never be parted again 220 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https s pecies of k angaroos kangaroos generally live in droves sometimes consisting of only few animals sometimes of many hundred and ﬁfty or even more but boomer often lives during the greater part of the year quite alone like rogue elephant there are at least differen t kinds of kangaroos the smaller ones being generally known wallabies and these are again divided into large wallabies and small wallabies the large wallabies are also called because they live in the thick brushy jungle called the bush which occupies so large part of the australian continent the biggest of them is really quite large animal when fully grown it is six feet long from the tip of the muzzle to the end of the tail some of the small wallabies however are very small several of them being bigger than rabbits then there are some of these animals which spend most of their life in the trees and are called four of these creatures that lived some time in the london zoo looked very odd they sat on the branches with their long tails hanging down behind them but even when they were on the ﬂoor of their cage one could not possibly mistake them their front limbs were almost long their hind ones the best known of these animals is found in queensland it spends the day in sleep only coming out from its retreat among the foliage when darkness has set in and it lives in the very thickest part of the bush which is hardly ever visited even by the natives it does not seem to be very good climber it is rather slow in its movements and appears to be little afraid of falling it clings so tightly to the branch on which it is resting that it is difﬁcult to force it to loose its hold the natives generally catch this curious kangaroo by climbing the tree in which it is sleeping jerking it from its perch by violent pull at its tail and throwing it to the ground to be killed by the dogs below but if it reaches the ground unhurt it makes off with great speed hopping along with ﬂying leaps like all the other members of the family kangaroo ats these animals often called potoroos are quite small even the largest of them being scarcely big rabbit they not jump so well the true kangaroos and generally run on all fours in kind of gallop but when they are at rest they sit upright on their hind quarters one of these animals known the bettong puts its tail to most curious use it makes its nest of grasses and leaves in hollow in the ground and when it is collecting materials building it gathers them up into bundle twists the tip of its tail round them and then hops swiftly away holding its little sheaf well away from its body it is most clever little builder when it has chosen suitable hollo w in the ground its nest it ﬁrst of all enlar ges it until it is big enough its requirements and then weaves its materials carefully together until the top of its little home is just on level with the herbage growing all round it and whenever it goes in or out it pulls tuft of grass over the entrance in order to prevent it from being noticed so well is the nest concealed that you might pass within few feet and look straight at it without seeing it this animal is also sometimes known the the s ugar quirrel among the australian mammals we ﬁnd good many which are really very much like those found in other parts of the world and might easily be mistaken them if it were not the presence of the marsupial pouch one of these is the curious sugar squirrel or which is really very much like the ﬂying squirrels of asia and north america it has the skin of the sides and ﬂanks developed in just the same manner and uses it in exactly the same way leaping from lofty bough spreading its 221 222 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https at right angles to its body so that the skin is stretched out between them and thus contriving to skim long distances through the air and the big bushy tail serves partly to help it in keeping its balance and partly to enable it to keep straight course during the daytime sugar are nearly always asleep in hollow tree or in some other convenient retreat but soon it grows dark they all come out from their and begin to frisk about and to leap from tree to tree with the utmost activity after time they will stop in order to search insects or to feast upon the honey which they ﬁnd in the blossoms of the trees but very shortly they recommence their gambols and so they go on alternately playing and feeding till the dawn the sugar is very pretty little creature the fur being brownish gray above with black stripe along the back and rich brown edging to the skin of the sides the lower parts of the body are nearly white and the tail is brown above and white beneath in length it is about nineteen or twenty inches rather more than half of which is occupied by the tail australian b ear there is an animal much like small bear that is often known the australian bear although its proper name is the koala when fully grown it is about big poodle it has stoutly built body very short legs large and almost square ears with fringe of stiff hairs round the edges and visib le tail while the fur is very thick and woolly in color it is ashy gray above and yellowish white under the body the koala spends most of its life in the trees yet it is not very good climber its movements are curiously slow and it always seems to feel in danger of falling on the ground it is slower and more awkward still its feet are much more suited grasping branch than use upon level surface but it does not often come down from the trees unless it wishes to drink or to vary its diet of leaves and buds by digging roots when mother koala has little one to take care of she always carries it about on her back and even when it is nearly half big she is it may sometimes be seen riding pickaback the koala is very gentle animal and even when it is captured it seldom attempts to scratch or bite but sometimes it gets in great passion over nothing at all and shows its teeth and yells and screams in such threatening manner that any one who did not know how harmless it really is would most likely be afraid of it owing to the fact that it spends so much of its life in the trees this animal is sometimes called the australian monkey and it is curious to ﬁnd that it has pouches in its cheek in which it can store away food just many of the true monkeys have the w omba t the wombat might easily be mistaken rodent its front teeth are formed almost exactly like those of the rabbit and the rat but it possesses marsupial pouch there can be doubt of the order it really belongs to it is not at all handsom animal in fact it is fat awkward clumsy and like much overgrown it seems to spend its whole life in eating and sleeping it can dig very well however and makes deep burrows in the ground with large at the end if in captivity it will often make its escape by digging its way out under the walls when fully grown the wombat is about three feet in length and its legs are so short that its body almost touches the ground it waddles awkwardly along like the koala it is very gentle in disposition and hardly even struggles when it is captured although it is subject to sudden ﬁts of passion if it is kept pet it soon becomes very affectionate and likes to go to sleep on its owner knees like cat in color this animal is dark grayish brown it is found in new south wales victoria and south australia the b andicoots 223 224 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https are about dozen different kinds of these very animals perhaps we can best describe them by saying that if you can imagine rat with snout drawn out like that of shrew very large ears three very long toes with still longer claws on each foot together with two toes with claws at all and rather short hairy that is what bandicoot looks like owing to the very odd way in which their feet are formed bandicoots can not run like other animals but travel along by means of curious mixture of running and jumping they are common in most parts of common in fact that they are generally regarded great nuisance they terrible amount of mischief both in gardens and in cultivated ﬁelds feeding both upon grain and fruits well upon the roots and bulbs which they scratch up out of the ground during the daytime they are hardly ever seen they hide away in holes in the ground or in hollow trees and remain fast asleep till after sunset some of them however make nests of dry leaves and grasses which are so cleverly concealed among the herbage that it is very difﬁcult to ﬁnd them the t asmanian w olf there are certain marsupial animals which look though they belonged to the dog and cat tribes they are called dasyures and are beasts of prey one of these is the tasmanian wolf or thylacine it is often called which is so both in appearance and habits that it fully deserves its name but you can tell it from the true wolves at glance by the dark stripes upon its back and also by its long slender tail which tapers down almost to point it is also known the and the tiger the tasmanian wolf used to be very common indeed it was the most powerful of all the tasmanian animals so that it had natural foes while it was very seldom killed by the natives but when white settlers came to live in the country they found that it killed so many of their sheep that it was necessary them to all that they could to destroy it so numbers of tasmanian wolves were shot and numbers more were caught in traps and by degrees the animal was driven back until now it is only found in wild and rocky districts among the mountains which are scarcely ever trodden by the foot of man there are very few of the australian animals which not fall victims to this ﬁerce and savage creature even kangaroos are killed by it at times and it has been known to destroy and devour the echidna which is something like small porcupine but besides feeding upon living prey it will feed heartily upon any carrion that it may ﬁnd and will also prowl about on the in search of the various dead animals which are ﬂung up by the waves the tasmanian wolf is nocturnal animal remaining hidden all day long in some deep recess among the rocks into which ray of sunshine can ever penetrate it does not like the daylight at all and seems most uneasy if it is brought out from its retreat and strange to say it has kind of inner eyelid which it draws across its eyes every moment or two in order to keep out the light much possible the t asmanian d evil just the tasmanian wolf is like dog so the tasmanian devil is like small and very wild ﬁerce savage bear too its name has been given to it on account of its disposition and there is perhaps animal which it is so difﬁcult to tame matter how kindly it is treated it is always sullen and always ferocious it will ﬂy at the very hand that gives it food if you merely look at it it lies in its cage it will dash furiously at the bars with its teeth bared uttering yells and screams of passion you can not help feeling that it would tear you to pieces if only it had the chance and its teeth are so sharp and its jaws are so powerful that there are very few dogs which could overcome it in fair ﬁght the tasmanian devil has its eyes protected just the tasmanian wolf has and like that animal it is seldom seen abroad by day it is extremely mischievous night after night it will visit the and the sheepfolds not only preying upon the poultry and the young lambs but seeming to kill the very sake of killing so it has been almost 225 226 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https persecuted the tasmanian wolf and has altogether disappeared from many districts where it used to be plentiful while in many others it is very seldom found in size the tasmanian devil is about big badger and in color it is dull sooty black with white collar streak on the lower part of the throat then the larger dasyures may be compared to cats to which they are just about equal in size in tasmania indeed they are called wild cats they live in trees sleeping in hollows in the trunks during the day and prowling about in search of prey by night and they are almost mischievous in poultry yards the tasmanian devil but then on the other hand they will learn to catch rats and mice if they are tamed and trained just cat will there are several different kinds of these animals but they all agree in having grayish or fur with number of white spots on the sides of the body pouched m ice very pretty and graceful little creatures are these there are good many different kinds of them they are all small the largest of them being bigger than rat while some of them are not equal in size even to an ordinary mouse and they breed very freely and have quite number of little ones at every birth they are among the most plentiful of all the australian mammals pouched mice always spend much of their time in the trees where they seem quite contented they on the ground they run up and down the trunk with the greatest activity scamper along the branches leap from one bough to another and never seem to miss their footing and they are continually poking their sharp little muzzles into the cracks and crevices of the bark in order to search tiny insects and spiders their habits are not very much like those of mice and one can not help thinking that they ought to be called pouched shrews the m yrmecobius or b anded nt eater this marsupial is found in southern and western australia it is prettily marked little animal of about the same size squirrel with pointed snout long slender body and rather long and bushy tail in color it is dark chestnut brown above and white below while number of white stripes run across the hinder part of the back and loins beginning just behind the shoulders and ending little above the root of the tail the myrmecobius lives principally on the ground but it is very good climber nevertheless and can ascend trees and run about on the branches with considerable activity it feeds on ants and termites catching them by means of its long and tongue which is so sticky that the insects adhere to it soon they are touched the marsupial pouch is almost entirely wanting so that one might almost be led to suppose that the animal must be true but then the have teeth at all while the myrmecobius has less than or more than any other mammal with the exception of one or two members of the whale tribe and the armadillo this curious and pretty little animal is very gentle in disposition and never seems to bite or scratch even if it is taken prisoner it makes its home either in the decaying trunk of fallen tree or else in hole in the ground the p ouched m ole this one of the most curious of all the marsupial animals was quite unknown until recent time in size and shape it is very much like the common mole and it has its fore paws armed with enormous claws digging in just the same manner in color it is pale yellow it has outward ears and its eyes are so tiny and so deeply buried in the skin that it must be almost if not quite unable to see with them and in front of its snout is an odd kind of shield made of thick horny skin which is evidently intended to protect the face the animal forces its way through the ground 227 228 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https singular creature lives in sandy districts in the deserts of south australia it appears to burrow through the soil few feet then to come to the surface and crawl little distance and then to burrow again and it creeps over the sand it leaves three tracks behind it one being made by the feet on either side and the third by the stiff and stumpy little tail which appears to be pressed down upon the ground these tracks of course can only be seen after rain in dry weather the sand very soon falls in upon them and ﬁlls them up opossums the next group of the marsupial animals is found not in australia but in america there are several different kinds of opossums most of which live in the trees they are excellent climbers they not only have their hind feet made more like hands with great toe which enables them to grasp the branches but are also the possessors of long prehensile tails like those of the spider so power ful is the tail of an opossum that it can bear the entire weight of the body the animal swings from branch to pluck fruit which would otherwise be out of its reach but opossums not feed upon fruit alone indeed there are very few things which they will not eat they are very fond of maize or indian corn example obtaining it sometimes by climbing up the stems of the plants and sometimes by cutting them down close to the ground nuts too they devour in great quantities together with acorns and berries sometimes they dig up roots out of the ground then they will search birds nests and carry off the eggs or the unﬂedged little ones they will pounce upon rabbit too or young squirrel and not disdain mice or lizards or frogs or even insects and the farmer has very good cause disliking them they not only get into his ﬁelds and steal his grain but ﬁnd their way into his and carry off the eggs and the young chickens but then they are very easily caught they are attracted by any kind of bait and will walk into the simplest of traps yet in some ways they are exceedingly cunning if they are caught example and are injured in even the slightest degree they will pretend to be dead and will allow them selves to be pulled about or kicked or beaten without showing any sign of life then the moment they think that one is looking at them they will rise to their feet and quietly slink away from this we get the proverb playing possum during the daytime the opossum is usually fast asleep in its nest which is sometimes made by itself and sometimes is the deserted home of squirrel so it has to be hunted by night moonlight night is always chosen this purpose and the animal is ﬁrst of all driven into tree by dogs one of the hunters then climbs the tree and shakes it down from the branch to which it is clinging and the moment it reaches the ground it is pounced upon and destroyed by the dogs the opossum runs in very curious manner moving both limbs of the same side together when the little opossums are born they are not only blind like puppies and kittens but are quite deaf well and not get their sight and hearing some little time they remain hidden all of their infancy in the mother pouch staying there ﬁve or six weeks and afterward riding about on her back the common opossum is about big cat but it looks much more like very big rat its tail is long and scaly it is found in north america in south america there is different species called the opossum because it is so fond of the crabs and crayﬁshes which abound in the salt creeks and the great swamps of brazil then merian opossum in which the marsupial pouc h is not developed has most curious way of carrying its young about the little ones stand in row on their mother back with their tiny tails coiled tightly round hers to prevent them from falling off and the yapock opossum spends most of its life in the water and lives upon ﬁsh being such an excellent swimmer that it is able easily to overtake them 229 230 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of all we come to two most extraordinary animals which differ from all other mammals in the fact that they lay eggs while in some parts of their skeletons they closely resemble the reptiles the chidna the ﬁrst of these creatures is called the echidna and is also known the spiny eater it is from ﬁfteen to nineteen inches in length and has the whole upper surface of the head and body covered with mixtu re of stiff hairs and short sharp spines something like those of hedgehog the head is drawn out into very long slender snout at the tip of which the nostrils are placed and the tongue is long and and very sticky just it is in the true the feet are furnished with enormous claws which are used in tearing open the nests of the insects upon which the animal feeds and those of the hind feet strange to say are turned backward in walking so that they point toward the tail instead of the head these claws are also used in digging and can be used with such effect that if the animal is surprised when on sandy soil it sinks into the ground if by magic but if the ground is so hard that it can not use its claws it rolls itself up like hedgehog and trusts to its spiny coat protection the common echidna is found in australia tasmania and new guinea beside s this there is another species called the echidna which is found in new guinea only the d uckbill even more curious still is the duckbill or platypus which not only lays eggs like bird but resembles bird in several other ways well it has bill example just like that of and ﬂat with number of grooves round the edges and it feeds by taking beakful of mud from the bottom of pond or ditch squirting out the mud itself through the grooves and then swallowing the grubs and other small creatures which are left behind then its feet are like those of duck the toes being joined together by webbing so that they can be used paddles and even the tail is rather like that of duck it is very broad and ﬂat so that it can serve rudder when the animal is swimming this remarkable creature is found in southern and eastern australia and also in tasmania it is not at all uncommon but is seldom seen it spends most of its time in the water or else in its burrow which is always made in the bank of pool or stream this burrow is generally long one running to distance of forty or even ﬁfty feet and terminates in large chamber which is used nursery and it always has two entrances one below the surface of the water and one above so that if the animal is alarmed in any way it can run in by one door and out again by the other two eggs are laid by this most curious creature they measure about of an inch in length and are enclosed in tough white shell how they are hatched nobody seems quite to know but when the little ones ﬁrst make their appearance they are quite blind and quite naked and have hardly any beaks at all when fully grown the duckbill is about eighteen inches long from the end of the snout to the tip of the tail birds 231 232 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https xx birds of prey we have now ﬁrst to think of the great class of the birds which are distinguished from all other living creatures by having their bodies covered with feathers these feathers serve double purpose typical birds of prey buzzard golden eagle great horned owl in the ﬁrst place they help to preserve the warmth of the body birds are their blood is good deal warmer than they often have to ﬂy very fast through very cold air so you see it is most important that they should be clothed with some sort of covering which is very warm and at the same time light and nothing is warmer and at the same time lighter than coat of feathers and then in the second place many of these feathers are most useful in ﬂight without them indeed bird could not ﬂy at all if we want to keep tame bird from escaping we have only to clip its wings and then it can longer raise itself into the air but it is not only the feathers of the wings that are used in ﬂight those of the tail are employed well they assist in ﬂight especially in checking speed and serve rudder enabling the bird to steer its way through the air now birds are divided into orders and tribes and families just the mammals are but scientiﬁc men are not quite sure which of the orders ought to be placed ﬁrst among the birds of prey however we ﬁnd some of the largest and ﬁnest and most powerful of all the feathered race so that we can not better than place these at the head of our list you can always tell bird of prey by two points in its structure the ﬁrst we ﬁnd in its beak which is always very large and strong and very sharply hooked and the second we ﬁnd in its talons which are specially made seizing and killing the animals upon which it feeds some persons think that an eagle or hawk kills its victims with its beak but that is great mistake the beak is only used tearing the ﬂesh from off its bones 233 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https it is dead the real weapons are the talons which are so sharp and so strong that they can be pressed deeply into the vitals of captured animal and kill it at once all the birds of prey therefore have very powerful legs and lar ge feet and claws vultures ymbols of r apacity first among the birds of prey come the vultures yet very often strange to say they never kill any prey at all and the best naturalists suspect that they should be placed in class by themselves they much prefer to feed on carrion so that if they can ﬁnd the dead body of an animal they will never take the trouble to seek and kill victims themselves when an animal dies in country in which vultures live several of these birds are sure to ﬁnd its carcass almost immediately and in very short time nothing will be left of it but just the bare skeleton so you see these birds are really very useful they belong to the great army of nature dustmen just like the jackals and the hyenas by destroying these carcasses before they can putrefy they help to keep the air pure in the cities of the southern united states and of the tropics our small american vulture the is really depended upon scavenger how vultures ﬁnd the dead body of an animal is just little doubtful some naturalists have thought that they ﬁnd it by means of sight and others that they so by means of smell it seems almost certain however that when they are hovering high in the air they are really watching one another so that when one of them sees carcass and swoops down upon it all the other vultures within sight notice what he is doing and come hurrying up share in the banquet this explains how it is that if an animal is killed when not vulture is to be seen quite number of these great strong ravenous birds will make their appearance in very short time the l ammergeier this is the ﬁnest of all the vultures it is found in southern europe in northern africa and in western asia and is sometimes much four feet in length from the tip of the beak to the end of the tail while its wings may measure more than ten feet across when fully spread it is one of the very few vultures which have the head and neck clothed with feathers besides this curious tuft of hairs covers the nostrils while similar tuft grows just under the base of the bill this reason the bird is sometimes known the bearded vulture lammer geiers are generally found among high mountains where they prey upon hares and marmots and even upon rats and mice they will visit the ﬂocks too which are feeding upon the grassy slopes and carry off kids and lambs chamois when formerly they were more plentiful than now used to be attacked by them and their favorite plan was to swoop down upon them when they were standing on the brink of precipice strike them over into the depths below by stroke of their powerful wings and then descend to feed upon their mangled bodies the plumage of the lammer geier is grayish brown above and nearly white below the feathers of the neck are white and there is also pale streak running down the middle of those upon the back the lammer geier makes great clumsy nest of sticks which is sometimes placed on ledge of lofty cliff and sometimes in the topmost branches of very tall tree two eggs are laid which are dirty white in color with brownish blotches the c ondor the condor is another very large vulture inhabiting the great mountain chain of the andes there it may be seen soaring high in air its keen eyes intently scanning the ground beneath it and it may ﬂy to and fro hours rising and falling and sweeping round in great circles and yet never once ﬂap its wings 234 235 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https live the most part on llamas which have died natural death or which have been killed by pumas and only partly devoured but two or three of them will unite together when they are hungry in order to kill sheep or cattle in color the condor is grayish black with ruff of white feathers round the lower part of the neck on the head of the male is large ﬂeshy wattle it makes nest at all but simply lays its two white eggs on rocky ledge high up on the mountainside variety of the condor inhabited mexico and southern california until recent years but has now become almost or quite extinct it differed little from that of the andes in either appearance or habits the s ecret ary ulture the african was formerly regarded kind of crane on account of its long legs and owes its name to the curious tuft of very long feathers at the back of its head which cause it to look rather though it were carrying number of quill pens behind its ears the two middle feathers of the tail also are exceedingly long so that when the bird is standing upright their tips almost rest upon the ground the spends its time on the ground where it wanders over the plains in pairs and feeds upon small mammals lizards tortoises frogs and locusts it is also said to kill and devour even lar ge snakes but whether it really does so is not quite certain eagles ymbols of p ower next to the vultures come the eagles of which two examples may be or bald eagle and the golden eagle or the indians called it both are known in various local varieties in all parts of the world and both have been regarded with admiration by brave men in all ages the bald eagle is the symbol of the united states and its cousin the is to be seen along all the coasts of the old world except the arctic the american eagle frequents the shores of both oceans and of our great lakes and rivers because its favorite food is ﬁsh which it obtains mainly by robbing the industrious of nobler character according to our human ideas is the golden eagle and it is also larger the in birds of prey usually exceeds her mate in measuring nearly three feet in length and eight or nine feet across her outspread wings this magniﬁcent bird may still frequently be seen in the remoter and more mountainous parts of both continents but in america is extremely rare east of the rocky mountains and lake superior and in europe west of the swiss and german alps this was the eagle which by its bold mien so impressed the early conquerors of italy that they chose it to represent them on their coins and standards so that it came to be known throughout subject world the roman eagle and its image has descended to the arms of italy austria germany russia and other nations the aerie or of these grand birds is much the same in both rude heap of sticks sufﬁciently hollowed on the summit to hold the eggs and placed upon ledge of rocks or perhaps in the top of some huge tree it may serve the purpose of home many years in succession eagles have been recorded on both sides of the atlantic using the same aerie nearly century without interruption and in such cases the structure often becomes of prodigious size nest found in scotland was nine feet high ﬁve feet across at the top and twenty feet in width at the bottom so that it was really big haystack round this nest were the bones of between forty and ﬁfty grouse besides those of number of lambs rabbits and hares which had been brought there by the parent birds the use of the young very often ledge close to the aerie is used larder where the old birds put their victims soon they are caught and leave them until they are wanted when they are hunting the two birds generally work together one dashing in among bushes and low herbage among which hares partridges or other animals are likely to be hiding and the other lying in wait to pounce upon them they rush out in alarm 236 237 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https sprey and ther h awks not quite big the eagles the or osprey is nevertheless large bird it measures nearly two feet in length and between ﬁve and six feet in spread of wing it is found in nearly all parts of the world where civilization is not too destructive of its privileges and is numerous on all our great lakes and rivers well by the coast the osprey feeds almost entirely upon ﬁsh and may be seen sweeping to and fro over the water keenly watching its victims they rise to the surface when it catches sight of ﬁsh it swoops down upon it plunges into the water with great splashing and nearly always rises again moment or two later with the ﬁsh struggling in its talons but it does not always succeed in reaching the shore with it the eagle is also very fond of ﬁsh though it does not like the trouble of catching them so it lies in wait the it returns from ﬁshing expedition and beats it about the head with its great wings until it is glad to drop its victim in order to escape when the eagle swoops down and catches the morsel before it reaches the ground these great birds may still be seen all along our coasts and beside our lakes where they live usually unmolested although most other hawks are likely to be shot at by every wandering man and boy with gun this safety is due not only to the belief that they particular harm but to feeling especially along the eastern that it is lucky thing to have pair build their nest near the home of ﬁsherman to whom they are thought to bring good fortune this nest is big structure of sticks which is placed among the branches of tree near the preferably tall tree but sometimes when these are not handy in low one thus at the eastern end of long island new york where the ospreys have been protected many years their nests often rest on small cedar or other tree close to the ground and in some places on the coast of new england men have erected little platforms on the top of poles where the ospreys have made their homes all these nests are repaired and occupied year after year and thus sometimes grow to be of immense size familiar f alcons and h awks if one were to try to describe even half of the great number of different kinds of falcons and hawks in the world or even in america this book would not be large enough the purpose among those most often seen in this country are two large softly plumaged brown hawks with square barred tails of the group called buzzard one is the another the and third the the several names denoting the specially noticeable features in each case all make their homes in the woods constructing big nests in trees and early in the spring laying eggs these hawks ﬂy heavily over the ﬁelds in search of frogs small snakes of which they catch great numbers and once in while seize young bird which can not yet ﬂy very well but mostly they live on mice and insects the country people call all of them and are likely to shoot them when they can but in truth they harm the very little the really dangerous are two or three much smaller and more active falcons such the cooper and hawks they are swift and ﬁerce and will dart down and snatch bird from its perch or pick up small chicken with amazing suddenness and speed these hawks are sometimes called kestrels after european falcon which they resemble kestrels and other c hicken awks you may often see one or the other of these hovering high in the air the english kestrels about three or four hundred feet from the ground and carefully watching the mice upon which after all they mainly feed it has eyes like telescopes so that soon mouse pokes its head out of its burrow it catches sight of it swoops down upon it seizes it in its talons and carries it off to be devoured the number of mice which it catches in this way is very large and it has been estimated that at least ten thousand of these destructive little creatures are killed by every kestrel in the course of every year so 238 239 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https must look upon the bird one of the best friends of the farmer in spite of the occasional loss of chicken when it can not ﬁnd any mice the kestrel will sometimes eat small birds and now and then it will feed upon cockchafers and other large insects catching them in its claws they ﬂy and then passing them up to its beak kestrels sometimes build in trees and sometimes in towers and old buildings but very often they make use of the deserted nest of magpie or crow from four to six eggs are laid which are blotched with reddish brown on ground two near relatives inhabiting both the old and the new worlds are the and they are much alike and their plumage is more varied in color and pattern than that of other falcons both are rather shy and not often seen in the open but are so courageous that they will sometimes attack large birds like ducks or grouse the handsome is best known it will often dash into ﬂock of sparrows and carry one of them off in its talons it will sometimes swoop down into farmyard too and snatch up chicken or duckling while numbers of young pheasants and partridges fall victims to its ravages in days of old it was sometimes captured and trained hawking like the merlin and the falcon and it is said that single tame would sometimes kill many seventy or eighty quail in single day in europe seldom take the trouble to build nest of their own but nearly always make use of the deserted abode of crow or magpie in which they lay three or four eggs marked with number of spots and blotches but the american hawks of this group make their homes in crannies in hollow trees stufﬁng the hole with warm bed of grass and feathers owls the t error of the n ight next in order come those very singular birds which we call owls and which are really hawks that ﬂy by night the eyes of these birds are very much like those of cats being formed in such way to take in even the faintest rays of light owing to this fact owls can see on very dark nights and can ﬂy with much certainty and catch their prey with much ease other birds can in the daylight moreover the prominence of their eyes in the middle of the great feathery disks enables them to see in almost every direction without turning the head this is very important wild animals are always alarmed by motion while they hardly ever notice creatures which keep perfectly still if you sit or stand while without moving even ﬁnger rabbits and squirrels will often come quite close to you and never seem to see you at all but at your very ﬁrst movement they will take fright and scamper away so if an owl had to be constantly turning its head from side to side in order to look prey its victims would certainly see it and would make good their escape but its eyes are set in the middle of those great feathery circles and turn easily in their sockets there is need it to so it can look out in almost every direction without moving its head in the least there are good many different kinds of owls several of which are found in both continents there is the owl instance which has two rather long feathery tufts upon its head and there is the owl which has short ones rule these tufts lie ﬂat upon the head but when the bird is excited they stand upright and give it very odd appearance then there is the brown owl which utters that mournful hooting sound which one so often hears by night in wooded districts very often one is walking along country lane in the evening one of these birds sweeps suddenly by and disappears into the darkness it is busy searching mice and the number which it catches must be very great it has been found that when pair of these birds have little ones they bring mouse to them about once in every quarter of an hour all through the night and besides that their own appetites have to be satisﬁed and owls seem always to be hungry 240 241 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https day the late lord lilford one of the foremost british ornithologists of his time tried to see how many mice really could swallow so he caught one of these birds and put it in cage and gave it seven mice one after the other six of these it gulped down without any hesitation but though it tried hard to swallow the seventh it could not quite manage to so and about twenty minutes the tail of the mouse was dangling from corner of its beak at last however the tail disappeared and three hours later the owl was actually hungry again and ate four more mice none of the owls ever digest the bones and feathers or hair of their prey but these materials get packed into balls in the stomach and after time are coughed up and thrown away very often large quantities of these pellets are found in hollow trees in which owls have been roosting more than bushel having been taken from single tree and by examining them one may learn the character of the bird daily fare the birds not make nest but lay their eggs on heap of these pellets instead and they have an odd way of laying them at intervals so that sometimes little ones newly hatched little ones and freshly laid eggs may all be found together when the young owls are waiting their parents to return with mouse they always get very much excited and make most odd noises something like loud hisses followed by loud snores and when at last one of the old birds returns with mouse in its talons the outcry grows louder than ever one of the oddest members of the family is the burrowing owl or coquimbo the south american form is known this inhabits only the open plains of western north america and southern south america and it can ﬁnd trees or rocky niches in which to nest it scratches out shallow burrows in little banks of earth or takes possessi on of the deserted burrows of some digging animal it is therefore constant citizen of the towns of the of the north and viscachas of the south where numbers of burrowing owls may sometimes be seen some hunting about beetles and grasshoppers on which they chieﬂy feed and others sitting at the entranc es of the burrows and surveying the surrounding country they are not at all timid and if man approaches them they will remain wher they are until he is quite close bobbing up and down from time to time though they were politely bowing to him if he continues to walk toward them they will rise into the air ﬂy two or three times round his head screaming loudly they so and then settle down on another mound few yards away and bow to him again but if he walks round them instead they will turn their heads to look after him without moving their bodies until one would almost think that they would twist them of f altogether when neither nor viscachas live in the neighborhood these queer little owls will sometimes take up their quarters in the burrow of wolf fox or badger they make very rough nest of grass and feathers in which they lay from six to eleven white eggs chapter xxi cuckoos nightjars woodpeckers and toucans in europe the cuckoo is one of the most familiar and birds and every one recognizes its note and regards it sure sign that summer is near the bird usually reaches england about the second week in april and very soon after that time the cock bird may be heard uttering his cry which is one of the most familiar sounds of the country until two months later then the bird voice breaks and after crying 242 243 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https few days instead of the simple cuckoo he becomes quite dumb and is quite unable to utter his note again until the following spring this cuckoo is famous its singular habit of placing its egg in the nest of some other bird instead of making nest of its own the hen bird seems ﬁrst of all to lay her egg on the ground then picking it up in her beak she ﬂies off to look suitable nest in which to put it having found one she waits her opportunity when the occupant is absent and then slips in the egg and ﬂies away the owner of the nest strange to say hardly ever seems to notice when she comes back that there is strange egg among her own although very often it is not in the least like them in color and markings so before very long young cuckoo is hatched out together with her own little ones then on the very day of its birth the cuckoo seems to make up its mind that before long there will be room in the nest any one but itself and actually pushes all its little foster brothers and sisters over the side one after the other and strange to say the mother bird does not seem to mind but just gives all the food which her own young would have eaten to the cuckoo and takes the greatest care of it in every way until it is able to ﬂy the cuckoo family is large and varied one with representatives in all parts of the world and few of them show this extraordinary disposition to impose upon their neighbors though all are careless home in the united states we have two kinds of cuckoos the and the which have much the same slim form and plain yet elegant dress their european cousin but different note utteri ng loud rattling cry instead of the soft and both of these make nests lay eggs in them and rear their young faithfully other birds the nests however are merely loose platforms of twigs set among the branches of some small tree through which often the eggs are distinctly visible nightjars the nightjars are another family with great similarity in both appearance and habit among its members all are nocturnal have big heads large eyes and very small beaks although the mouth opens very wide they hunt their food by night resting during the day in shady forests or caves and like owls they have plumage so plainly brown and gray and so soft that their ﬂight is noiseless and almost invisible the name refers to its jarring cry which is more or less characteristic of the whole family given ﬁrst to the british species which is often called in englan late in the evening you may often hear it uttering its curious chur sometimes goes on without any break three or four minutes this continuous calling is one of the most characteristic things about our american nightjar the whippoorwill whose loud musical cry is heard in summer from almost every hillside in the land during the dusk of evening or morning or when the woods are whitened with moonlight and sometimes two or three birds will sing against one another if in jealous rivalry repeating the call several hundred times without pause in the western united states and in tropical america are several kinds of whippoorwills and in the southern states bigger cousin which calls its name loudly through the more nearly deserving the name nightjar however is our hawk or bullbat which is often seen ﬂying swiftly about high in the air even before sunset uttering hoarse scream or note it rushes after unlucky insects all the birds of this group are insect catchers and eaters and their mouths which have only tiny pretence of beak open exceedingly wide so that they may scoop in dozen little ﬂies at once or seize and swallow great moth then the tongue is exceedingly sticky like that of an besides this the sides of the beak are fringed with long stiff bristles so when the bird catches an insect its victim nearl y always sticks ﬁrmly to its tongue while if it should break away from that the bristles act just like cage and prevent it from escaping the nightjars make nest at all but lay their eggs in small hollow in the ground generally under the shelter of fern or tuft of bramble or heather these eggs are never 244 245 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https than two in number and are grayi sh white in color mottled and marbled with gray and buf swifts in these arrangements and habits the nightjars show how nearly they are related to the very differently appearing which look so much like swallows that we often call them but this is wrong before this country was inhabited by white men the swifts dwelt in companies in hollow trees but fast the settlers built houses and chimneys the swifts left the trees and made their homes in the chimneys where they fasten to the bricks little nests composed of their saliva and bits of twigs in the east indies kind of swift makes such nest wholly out of its saliva which hardens into whitish material like isinglass this is fastened against the wall or roof of some cave by the sea and the malays and chinese gather these nests at the peril of their lives where they are built in hundreds in dark caverns and sell them delicacies to be made into soup the swift feeds upon ﬂies and small beetles which it catches in the air and on any ﬁne summer day you may see it hawking prey it well deserves its name it dashes through the air with most wonderful speed and is said to be able to ﬂy at the rate of two hundred miles an hour and it ﬂies it keeps twisting and turning after the fashion of bat and is evidently snapping up insect after insect it goes yet strange to say the bird never seem s to be tired it is often on the wing before three in the morning and is still darting about actively ever after sunset four handsome birds american pileated woodpecker or logcock european roller european kingﬁsher european jay humming irds although they are not very much like swifts the are closely related to them and have powers of ﬂight which are really almost wonderful indeed if you alarm one of these birds when it is hovering over ﬂower it will dart away with such astonishing speed that it is almost impossible the eye to follow its course and even 246 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https it is hovering the wings vibrate so rapidly that you can not see them all that is visible being faint blur on either side of the body these exquisite little birds are found in central and south america in the west indies and in the warmer parts of the united states several very beautiful species are known west of the rocky mountains but only one the visits the eastern states rule they are most beautifully colored their plumage shining with metallic gold and copper and bronze and purple and crimson and blue and green sometimes there are great many different is ruff round the neck or long tufts upon the head or perhaps two of the may be produced until they are longer than the head and body and the rest of the tail put together rule the beaks of are very long in order that they may be poked into ﬂowers in search of any insects which may be lying hidden within them and the bird will hover over bush and move on from one blossom to another until every one has been thoroughly explored the nests of are nearly always very small and and are made of little bits of lichen and moss neatly fastened together with the silken threads of certain spiders only two eggs are laid which are quite white and so tiny that it seems impossible that bird could be hatched out of them at least ﬁve hundred kinds of these beautiful little birds have already been discovered woodpeckers north america has large population of woodpeckers including the biggest and ﬁnest one in the world this is the great inches in length and black with white grand scarlet topknot and beak like an ivory pickax it used to be abundant all over the south ern states but now is nearly extinct almost ﬁne and still frequently seen all over the eastern parts of the united states and canada is the similar but smaller logcock or pileated woodpecker it is named in the books whose shrill scream may be heard half mile most of our familiar woodpeckers howe ver are much smaller and their plumage is checker of black and white everywhere common in town well among the farmlands are three or four species of which the most often seen and the smallest is the downy woodpecker which gets its name from the broad stripe of soft white feathers up and down the middle of its back it is not so large sparrow and haunts the woods the farmer orchards the along the rural roads or beside the streets of our villages and often makes itself welcome visitor to the city parks and garde ns from morning till night and all the year round it scrambles up and down the trunks of the trees and round and round their branches cleverly ﬁnding and dragging out insects or their young concealed under the scales of the bark and though it digs many pits none is deep enough to injure the tree the only woodpecker which digs deep enough to harm is the one which appears only in the spring going far north to breed and which country people call the sapsucker the downy and its relatives on the other hand are doing good every day especially welcome is this active little visitor in winter often with such small companions the chickadee and nuthatch when birds or any other sort of living things are scarce and we are longing their return if you sit down awhile at the foot of tree and keep very still indeed without moving even so much ﬁnger it will very likely come and sit on the trunk of another tree close by and begin to peck away with its long sharp beak in search of insects how it makes the chips ﬂy its beak is just like chisel and when the bird ﬁnds that beetle or grub has burrowed into the trunk it does not take very long to dig it out and it also has an extremely odd tongue which is very long and slender and very sticky and has curious tip by means of this tongue the bird can often drag an insect out of its burrow without being obliged to dig right down to it sometimes woodpeckers make most amusing mistake they hear the hummin g of telegraph wire and think that it must be caused by insects living in the posts so they set to work with the utmost energy to dig them out and are so diligent and so persevering 247 248 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https they have often been known to cut big hole right through telegraph post before ﬁnding out that there were insects there after all there is another thing that we wish you especially to notice about the woodpecker and that is the way in which it is enabl ed to sit on an upright long time without getting tired the fact is that it really sits on its own tail which serves kind of if you look at woodpecker tail you will ﬁnd that the feathers are very short and very stiff and that they are bent downward when the bird perches on the trunk of tree the tips of these feathers rest upon the bark and prop it up so that there is very little strain upon the muscles of the feet and legs downy after the manner of its kind uses its to form deep and safe home in some old tree or stump and often has enough conﬁdence in its friends of the village or farm to choose tall and therein it deposits its pure white eggs and shelters its babies moreover papa downy often digs near by more shallow tunnel himself where he spends the night in safety and comfort his mate is doing in her own snug chamber the hairy woodpecker is very similar to the downy in dress but larger and by means so numerous or familiar there are several northern and western kinds of checkered woodpecker such the the arctic and others but their habits are very similar and we may pass them by to speak of two species more notable in every way the r edhead and the f licker the redhead is most strikingly colored its whole head and neck are scarlet its shoulders and back black its and rump white and the tail black it is fairly large bird and bold one though like all woodpeckers it will slip around to the other side of the tree when it hears your step and then peep out with comical caution to see whether you are dangerous if you keep quiet it is likely soon to scuttle back and go on hammering making the chips ﬂy and the forest ring with its busy search after some buried grub the indians made good deal of use of the scarlet feathers of this bird and it is always tempting mark the wandering gunner so that it is wonder it is becoming rare in thickly settled regions much less handsome but more numerous woodpecker in all parts of the coun try is the or ﬂicker or ole it goes by many names among the boys who love to trace it to its in some tall stub and take if they can the pearly eggs that lie on bed of chips in the bottom of the cavity this with its accurately round doorway and hall goes straight into the two inches or so and then turns downward sometimes to the depth of foot this large woodpecker is not black and white like most of the others but wears dress of greenish brown with quills that look just though they were gilded and small bonnet of red on the back of its head where there is crest in fact the ﬂicker is queer sort of woodpecker generally it spends quite much time in ﬁelds and gardens in the woods and much of this on the ground in search of ants woodpeckers are noisy birds both in their hammering and in their rough cries and this one is perhaps the noisiest of all but its call is so joyous that one can not hear it without sense of cheer toucans we now come to group of really extraordinary birds they are found in the forests of central and south america and are chieﬂy remarkable their beaks which in the ﬁrst place are so enormous that they look if they had been intended birds at least six times big and in the second place are most gaudily colored it is not very easy to describe them because there are good many kinds of toucans and each has its bill differently colored in one the beak is partly orange and partly black with lilac base in another it is light green with the tip and edges of the most brilliant scarlet in third it is half scarlet and half bright yellow while in fourth it is creamy white with broad 249 250 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of crimson running along the middle and in ﬁfth is most singular mixture of orange and blue and chocolate brown and white owing to the great size of their bills these birds are most ungainly in appearanc and one can not help wondering how they manage to hold up their heads but in reality these huge beaks are not at all heavy instead of being made of solid horn the whole of the interior is broken up into cells the divis ions between which are thicker than structure which gives them not only great lightness but great strength toucans live chieﬂy in the trees and spend most of their time in the topmost branches where they are fond of gathering together in large ﬂocks they are very noisy birds they not only utter hoarse cries and loud yells in chorus but have way of clattering their beaks together well owing to this habit the natives of south america sometimes call them preacher when they go to sleep toucans double their tails over upon their backs just though they had hinges at the base and bury their great beaks among the feathers of their shoulders the consequence is that they not look like toucans at all or even like birds and seem to be mere bundles of loose feathers hornbills these are more extraordinary still some of them having beaks so enormous that they look if they had been meant birds twelve times instead of only six times big themselves and the strangest thing of all is that upon the upper part is great horny helmet which in some cases is quite large the beak itself in the indeed the beak and helmet together are pretty nearly big the body both beak and helmet however except in one species are made just like the bills of the toucans so that in spite of their enormous size they are not at all heavy but why they should be so big is more than we can tell you hornbills are found in many parts of both africa and asia and most of them live in the trees they nearly always hop from one branch to another until they reach the very topmost boughs where they will sit hours together occasionally uttering series of loud roaring cries which can be heard very long distance and when they ﬂy they keep opening and closing their beaks and so making an odd clattering noise which generally puzzles travelers very much when they hear it the ﬁrst time there are two kinds of hornbills which live on the ground one of these is found in south africa and the kaﬁrs have curious idea about it due to the fact that after death its body smells very nasty they think that if one of these birds is killed and thrown into river it will make the stream feel ill and that heavy fall of rain will take place in order that the carcass may be washed into the sea so in times of drought they always try to kill and ﬂing it into the nearest river when one of these birds discovers snake its cries bring others to the place and then it is said three or four attack the snake and kill it their plan is to advanc upon it sideways with their wings spread out and to irritate it with the tips of the feathers until it strikes then they all peck it together before it can recover itself and nearly always succeed in killing it in very short time the h oopoe this is another bird but instead of having horny helmet like the hornbills it has crest of very long feathers these feathers which can be raised or lowered at will are tawny brown in color with black tips just before which is streak of white the body is grayish brown above and nearly white below and the wings and tail are black barred with white the real home of the bird is in the sandy deserts of northern africa and southern asia there its plumage harmonizes so well with the color of the soil that it is very difﬁcult to see it and it is said that when hawk appears the hoopoe only has to ﬂatten its 251 252 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https against the sand and remain perfectly still when it is quite sure to be overlooked by its enemy the hoopoe utters its cry in very curious manner first it puffs out the sides of its neck and then it hammers its beak three times upon the ground each time that it does so some of the air in its throat escapes and the result is noise like the syllable hoo three times repeated an rab l egend the arabs have an odd legend about the hoopoe one day so the quaint old story runs king solomon was traveling through the desert and was much oppressed by the heat of the sun till large ﬂock of hoopoes came and ﬂew just above his head so to protect him from its rays at the close of the day the grateful monarch wished to know how he could reward them their kindness and the foolish birds asked that crowns of gold might grow upon their heads their request was granted and few days they admired themselves immensely and spent most of their time in gazing at their reﬂections in pools of water very soon however great numbers of them were snared by the fowlers the sake of their valuable ornaments and it seemed though in short time not one would be left alive so at last the survivors went back to king solomon and begged that their golden crowns might be taken away once more the king listened to their petition and gave them crowns of feathers instead and that is how hoopoes come to have crests upon their heads kingfishers one of the most beautiful birds of our country is the kingﬁsher which is deep blue with white markings and chestnut band across the breast upon its head is borne high crest like crown you walk along the banks of stream you may often see them darting through the air and looking almost like streaks of colored light and if you sit down and keep perfectly still little while you may perhaps see one of them ﬁshing it perches on branch overhanging the water and waits patiently till ﬁsh passes underneath then suddenly it drops into the water like stone splashes about moment or two and then returns to its perch with its victim struggling in its beak the kingﬁsher digs deep hole into the face of some earthen bank or cliff and at the inner end hollows out little cave where it lays several pure white eggs with almost nothing but few ﬁshbones nest good many different kinds of kingﬁshers are found in various parts of the world one of them which lives in australia being known the laughing jackass on account of its singular cry everywhere there are birds of brilliant plumage and in some places they have been almost wholly destroyed the wicked purpose of getting feathers to use ornaments on ladies hats chapter xxii crows birds of p aradise and finches the crow tribe contains several most interesting birds ﬁrst among which stands the raven bird once known in all the northern parts of the world but now exceedingly rare in the united states except in the far west even in the mountainous districts of scotland it is not nearly so common it was it is so fond of killing weak and sickly lambs that the shepherds trap or shoot it whenever they have an opportunity and the gamekeepers dislike it quite much because of the numbers of hares rabbits partridges and grouse that fall victims to its terrible beak 253 254 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https have often been tamed and have even learned to talk almost well parrots but they are exceedingly misch ievous birds and in addition are only too ready to peck any one who comes near them with the full force of their sharp and powerful bills so that they can not be at all recommended pets the nest of the raven is rather clumsy structure of sticks and is nearly always placed in the upper branches of very tall tree when the young birds are nearly ﬂedged they often tumble out of the nest and are found by the shepherds ﬂuttering helplessly about on the ground most of the ravens which are kept in captivity have been caught in this way the merican c row the various crows of the world are like small sometimes marked with white but our familiar american crow is wholly black these birds are fond of gathering into ﬂocks which sometimes are very large and they are sociable liking to spend the night roosting in some favorite grove in great companies when near the sea or some large river or lake the crows go down to the shore every morning and spend most of the day on or near the beach where they pick up most of their food crows however will eat almost anything edible except grain and the great european is almost bird of prey like the raven it feeds chieﬂy on the ﬂesh of dead animals but it also preys upon such creatures rabbits hares mice frogs and lizards while it will also search the nests of game birds and poultry and carry off the eggs and the young sometimes too it will visit the seashore and feast upon the crabs limpets and mussels which it ﬁnds among the rocks at low water in order to crack the shells of these creatures it is said sometimes to carry them up into the air and drop them upon rock rooks except that it places its rude nest in scattered trees each pair by itself instead of in company our american crow is closely similar to the english rooks about which so much is said in books about great britain everybody in england knows the rook by sight and everybody is familiar with the rookeries in which number of these birds nest together year after year indeed they use the same nests over and over again just putting them into proper order shortly before the eggs are laid the scene when building operations begin is always lively one and all day long the birds are very busy but oddly enough they never seem to know when the winter is really over and when thaw comes after two or three frosty days in december or even earlier they get excited possible setting to work and gathering sticks and evidently thinking that spring is beginning rooks have very strict rules when they are building one rook to steal stick from another rook nest example is very serious crime and sometimes is punis hed even with death and young birds are not allowed to build in tree outside the rookery their nest being at once pulled to pieces by the older ones if they attempt to so crows of all kinds are extremely useful birds they devour enormous quantities of mischievous grubs more especially those which live at the roots of cultivate d plants where other birds can not get at them and you may often see them following the plow and picking up their victims in scores thus they more than pay the farmer the stalks of young corn or grain which they sometimes pull up in the spring the j ackda w another famous european bird taking part in many familiar stories and poems is the jackdaw it is smaller bird than the rook and is generally found near houses being very fond of nesting in church towers or in old ruins but very often colony of jackdaws will settle in lofty cliff and build on rocky ledges far beyond the reach of even the boldest climber 255 256 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https jackdaw is easily tamed and is very interesting bird when kept pet soon learning to talk almost well parrot but it is dreadfully mischievous and if it ﬁnds any small glittering object is almost sure to carry it off and hide it sometimes too it will play very amusing tricks we knew tame jackdaw once which lived in very large garden one day the butcher cart drove up and the butcher went round to the kitchen entrance to take the orders sooner had he disappeared than the jackdaw ﬂew up on the box and called out gee up off started the horse at once and if the gardener had not happened to meet the cart it was passing out of the gate with only the jackdaw inside the butcher would certainly have been obliged to walk all the way home the nest of the jackdaw like that of the rook is built of sticks and is lined with hay wool and feathers it generally contains ﬁve eggs which are bluish green spotted with gray and brown the j ay what beautiful bird the jay is and how very seldom one gets really good view of it it is one of the shyest of all birds and never allows itself to be seen if it can possibly help it and the very moment that it catches sight of one it ﬂies off with terriﬁed squall which can often be heard from nearly half mile away other birds not at all like the jay it is very fond of visiting their nests and stealing the eggs it will carry off young birds too and devour them and many young partridge and pheasant falls victim to its appetite but it also eats caterpillars moths beetles and other insects well fruit and berries while sometimes it will visit kitchen garden early in the morning and feast heartily on the young peas our common eastern american jay is light blue with pretty white markings while in the far west and in the tropics are many kinds which are rich dark blue or green the european jay however is more varied in general color it is light reddish brown on either wing is patch of azure blue banded with black while the head is decorat ed with crest of gray feathers with black spots which can be raised and lowered at will nearly all jays have tall crests the of the wings and tail are black the m agpie another famous member of this family is the magpie which occurs in both europe and america and may be recognized by its glossy black and white plumage its long tail and its curious dipping ﬂight it is found in most parts of the british isles but never wanders far away from the shelter of large woods where it knows that it is much safer from the attacks of hawks than in the open country the magpie is mischievous out of doors the jay and mischievous indoors the jackdaw so that it can not be said to bear very good character but at any rate it makes very amusing little pet even if it does steal any small object that it can carry away and hide it in some hoard of its own but with little careful instruction it soon learns to talk quite well in europe consequently many tame magpies are to be seen but not so often in the united states the nest of the magpie can not be mistak en that of any other bird although it is made of sticks like that of the jackdaw and the jay it is always domed above and has the entrance at the side it is generally situated in thorn or pine tree although now and then the birds will build in low bush quite close to the ground there are generally from ﬁve to seven eggs which are bluish white in color blotched and dotted with brown birds of p aradise next in order to the crows jays and magpies come these they include some of the most beautiful of all the feathered race they are nearly all found in new guinea and the papuan islands and there are altogether about ﬁfty dif ferent kinds one of the most beautiful is the king bird of paradise which it is very difﬁcult to describe in words the upper part of the body is rich chestnut with bloom of purple the 257 258 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https part pure white and across the breast runs band of golden green which deepens into blackish brown while the upper part of the head and neck is pale most exquisite of all however are the great masses of long slender drooping plumes which spring from either side of the body under the wings these plumes are nearly two feet long and are golden yellow darkening toward the tips into pale brown this exquisite plumage is only found in the cock bird the hen being of dull brown color all over without any plumes at all and the birds have now become extremely scarce because killed so incessantly the cruel purpose of getting their feathers to put on hats very little is known about the habits of birds of paradise few people ever have the opportunity of seeing them in their native forests and they are almost unknown in zoölogical gardens because they usually die almost immediately when placed in captivity in strange country bower irds the bower of australia owe their name to their singular habit of making bowers in which to play these bowers are built of sticks and long pieces of grass arranged in such way that they meet at the top so to form kind of avenue and are often three feet long stranger still they are ornamented with stones brightly colored shells and the blue of parrakeets which the birds carefully fasten up among the sticks evidently in order to make the bower look pretty then when it is ﬁnished they run through it round and round over and over again chasing one another and seeming to enjoy their game immensely there is one of these birds found in papua which builds hut about two feet high instead of bower and then makes sort of garden in front of it this garden is decorated with ﬂowers and berries and soon they fade the bird throws them away and puts fresh ones in their place it is called the gardener the s tarling this bird is almost well known the sparrow in europe you may see it on the lawn every now and then plunging its beak into the ground and pulling out grub or worm and it is fond of building great nest in water and other places where it is not wanted it is beginning to be well known also in america colonies are established near new york city starlings in europe often travel about the country in great ﬂocks which frequently consist of several thousand birds sometimes too several of these ﬂocks join together at night and then separate again next morning we have seen little copse so full of roosting starlings that every branch of every tree was occupied from end to end while thousands more kept ﬂying in and trying to turn the ﬁrst comers off their perches and they made so much noise that we could hear them chattering and quarreling when we were more than mile away each ﬂight of starlings seems to have its leader whose orders are instantly obeyed every bird in the whole ﬂock swerves and wheels and turns at the same maneuver seen equally in the vast migratory ﬂocks of blackbirds which gather in autumn on every american marsh and are gradually spreading inland few years hence the bird may be seen all over the united states starlings are useful birds although they certainly steal great deal of fruit if it were not their with those of certain other corn and vegetable crops would certainly be destroyed by the mischievous grubs which live at the roots so we ought to look on the fruit which starlings take wages paid them their work 259 260 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https and wea european yellowhammer african weaver male african weaver female european goldﬁnch stonechat finches we now come to the great group of the ﬁnches which can easily be recogniz ed by their short stout strong beaks this is one of the most extensive famili es of birds it includes besides the ﬁnches properly so called all the sparrows grosbeaks buntings and of the world together with many other similar birds known by various names the small robust size and especially the beak suitable cracking seeds or tearing the husks of fruit to pieces are the badges of the family sometimes this beak is big and strong in our northern or the southern cardinal grosbeak or the british bullﬁnch sometimes small and slender in the sparrows such our pretty visitor to the garden lilacs and the sometimes queerly out of shape in the crossbills where the lower half or mandible of the bill does not meet the upper one squarely at the tip but the points cross past one another these birds dwell in the northern evergreen forests and subsist almost wholly on the seeds of the pine and spruce which they twist out from beneath the tough scales of the cones with remarkable skill apparently using the crossed bill like pair of pliers these birds come south in winter when their bright reddish coats and fearless ways are enjoyed by everybody the farm children in germany hear pretty stories about them one of which is that the twist in the bill was caused by one of these birds injuring it in kindly trying to pull out the nails by which jesus was fastened to the cross so their name may be thought of in two ways sparrows every roadside and ﬁeld has its streaked birds which usually keep near the ground and feed upon the seeds of grasses and weeds yet pick up innumerable insects all the others of their busy tribe these sparrows make their nests mostly on 261 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https ground but most of the ﬁnches rightly so called nest in bushes and trees all the sparrows have pleasant voices and most of them are fair singers while some excel in that accomplishment our the whitethroat and others are among the best of american singing birds it has been said that these plain brown birds have been granted the gift of voice to make up lack of ornament but this explanation does seem to amount to much if it were true we ought to ﬁnd the richly dressed birds songless that this is not the case in this family at least is plain when we remember that our it is equally true of foreign some of the most brilliantly colored birds we have such the goldﬁnch the purple ﬁnch the indigo the exquisite blue and red nonpareil of louisiana and many others all of which are capital musicians some of these ﬁnches are among our most highly prized such the european bullﬁnch which not only sings prettily when wild but if caught young can be trained to learn several tunes and between whiles pipes and chirrups gaily the goldﬁnch linnet waxbill and several others belong to this interesting tribe canaries canaries too are ﬁnches and are plentiful in the islands from which they take their name but if you were to see them in their own home you would hardly recognize them wild canary that is yellow all over is hardly ever seen our in fact are an artiﬁcial breed the natural color of the plumage being olive green marked with black and yellow neither would you recognize the song of the wild birds which is not nearly so powerful nor so varied that of the feathered pets which we all know so well now and then talking canaries have been known which had learned to utter number of dif ferent words quite distinctly the s kylark bird is more celebrated than the skylark which has inspired countless poems it is plain brown little bird like one of our and would attract little attention were it not the sweetly clear and varied music of its joyous song it mounts higher and higher in the air till at last it looks mere speck in the sky nearly eight months in the year it sings and one can scarcely take ramble in the country without seeing and hearing it small colony of skylarks dwells on long island in the edge of brooklyn where the song may be heard by many person who can not go to europe to listen to it the skylark builds upon the ground in some little hollow and its nest is so well hidden that one scarcely ever ﬁnds it it is made of dry grass leaves and hair and contains four or ﬁve eggs speckled with brown chapter xxiii wagt ails shrikes thrushes etc one can scarcely walk along the banks of british stream in spring or summer without noticing pretty and graceful bird sometimes running along near the edge of the water and stopping every now and then to pick off an insect from the herbage and sometimes rising into the air to catch ﬂy or gnat and one can easily understand why the name wagtail has been given to it matter whether it is ﬂying or running its tail is never still sometimes too it may be seen in damp meadow or even on lawn in garden and where one wagtail is others are sure to be not very far of 262 263 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https nest of this bird is usually placed in hole in or else among the spreading roots of tree it is made of dry grass withered leaves and moss and is lined with hair wool or feathers this description applies excellently to little american bird known the water thrush although it is not true thrush but one of the warblers of which great many sorts some very beautiful are seen in our woods in the spring on their way north but just few appear to remain with us all the year round the c reeper running about on the trunks and branches of trees and looking very much like feathered mouse you may often see the creeper it is about big wren and has long slender and slightly curved beak which it is constantly poking into the cracks and crevices of the bark in search of insects it always begins its quest low down on the trunk and works its way gradually upward peering into every little cranny and seldom remaining still single moment the larger boughs are examined in just the same way and when the bird has reached the top of the tree it ﬂies down to another and begins again and so on all through the day and in order to prevent it from getting tired it has short stiff tail like that of the woodpe cker which serves kind of tool and supports the weight of the body the nest of this quaint little bird is nearly always placed in hole in it is made of roots twigs fragments of bark and grass and is lined with wool and feathers from six to nine eggs are laid which are white in color prettily spotted with yellowish red american insect ting birds chimney swift barn swallow wood thrush

another bird that one may often see running about on the trunk of tree it is shaped rather like wren but is little bigger than sparrow and has head and back white throat and breast it has the curious habit of keeping head downward almost continuously it works the european nuthatch is very fond of nuts which it cracks in most curious way first of all it wedges nut ﬁrmly in some crevice in the bark of tree then taking up its stand on the trunk just above it deals blow after blow on the nut with its stout little beak swinging itself up into the air every time that it does so and giving ﬂap with its wings so to add force to its stroke it turns itself into kind of live pickax and after very few blows the nutshell is split open and the clever little bird is able to get at the kernel but our american nuthatch seems to have forgotten this habit if it ever had it and lives almost wholly on insects the nuthatch makes its nest in hole in tree and it is generally composed of small pieces of soft bark lined with dry leaves when the mother bird is sitting on her eggs which are white in color spotted with pink she will peck most savagely at any enemy which may try to enter hissing she does so just like snake titmice these birds can be seen almost everywhere and very pretty and attractive little birds they are they run about on the trunks and branches of trees not seeming to mind in the least whether they are perching on bough or hanging upside down underneath it and all the while they are searching every little chink and cranny in order to see whether any small insects are hiding within it it is very good plan in winter to take or little network bag with lump of suet in it and hang it from the branch of tree the titmice day after day the little birds will visit it clinging to it in all sorts of positions and pecking vigorously away at the suspended dainty and they will like cocoanut which has been cut in half almost well several other kinds of titmice are also found in the british isles of which the great tit the and the blue tit are plentiful almost everywhere they are all very much alike in habits and they all build in holes in trees making their nests of moss hair wool and feathers and laying six or eight white eggs prettily speckled with light red titmice abound in all northern countries and we have several american specie s one of which the merry courageous little chickadee is known by both eye and ear to every one who takes any notice of birds in the southern states anothe r familiar one is the peto or crested chickadee who when he lifts his pointed gray cap reminds one of tiny jay the rocky mountain region and paciﬁc coast have several other kinds delightful our titmice all make their nests in holes in trees and stumps usually taking possession of the last year home of woodpecker in europe there is famous titmouse having very different method this is the tailed tit or it is sometimes called because its nest is shaped just like bottle without neck it is sometimes placed in the fork of branch but more generally in the middle of thick bush and is made of wool moss and spider and is lined with quantities of soft downy feathers and although it is by means small it is very easily overlooked the clever little birds cover all the outside with bits of gray lichen so to make it look much like the surrounding branches possible in this beautiful and cosy nest from ten to twelve eggs are laid which are white in color with just few very small reddish spots when the young birds are nearly ﬂedged they quite ﬁll up their nursery and you can actually see the walls swelling out and contracting again the little creatures breathe and how they all manage to keep their long tails unrufﬂed in those narrow quarters nobody knows at all 265 266 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https winter you may often see whole family of these pretty mother and ten or dozen little ﬂying about together they never separate until the spring the s hrike notable bird is the shrike which is also known the butcher owing to most curious habit it is bird of prey feeding upon all sorts of small creatures and it seems to know that though it can catch plenty of these on warm sunny days they will all be hiding away in their retreats when the weather is cold and rainy so on ﬁne bright morning it will catch many more victims than it wants at the time and put them away in its larder sometimes you may ﬁnd with four or ﬁve mice half dozen unﬂedged birds two or three fat caterpillars big beetle or two and perhaps bumblebee all stuck upon the thorns like the joints of meat hung up in butcher shop then you may be quite sure that you have discovered butcher larder and by and by when cold and wet day comes and the bird can catch prey it just comes and takes some of these creatures from the thorns and so obtains plenty of provisions there are two species of shrike in the united which visits us from the south in summer and the other from the north in winter thrushes the thrush family is spread all over the world and contains some of the most noted of singing birds one can read english poetry or much of the classic prose of our language without meeting with the names of such birds the mavis the blackbird the blackcap and especially the nightingale all european thrushes even the english robin after which our larger american redbrea st is named is sort of thrush closely related to our dear little bluebird the r obin the robin is great favorite with the people of europe because it is so very trustful we have actually seen one of these birds perching on man knee quite minute while it looked about worms in plot of ground which he had just been digging but it is by means so gentle bird many people think in fact it is very quarrelsome bird if two cock robins meet they are almost sure to ﬁght and very often the battle goes on until one of the two is killed robin once took up his abode in hereford cathedral and seemed to think that it was his own private property one day when another robin came in he was seen chasing it all over the building and was at last found sitting triumphantly on its dead body you may ﬁnd the nest of the robin in hole in bank or wall or perhaps in the stump of tree it is made of dry leaves roots grass and moss lined with hair or wool and contains either ﬁve or six eggs spotted with light brown the n ightingale perhaps bird in the world is so famous songster the nightingale largely because of its habit of singing in the night its music is not preëminent above that of several other thrushes the nightingale spends the winter in africa returning to central europe in april and after that in the warmer parts of great britain and the continent it may be heard every night weeks especially when the moon shines and sometimes nearly all day well if one passes near bush in which nightingale is singing it is worth while to stop and to whistle few low notes the bird imagines that it is being challenged by another nightingale and begins to sing louder than before then it stops and listens and if one whistles few notes more it becomes very much excited and comes closer and closer singing all the time till at last it ﬁnds out how it has been taken in and then it begins to scold chattering away in the greatest indignation at having been deceived 267 268 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https the cock nightingale sings and even he is only able to so few weeks very soon after the eggs are hatched his voice breaks just that of the cuckoo does and the only note which he is able to utter until spring comes round again is harsh whistle followed by hoarse croak the nest of the nightingale is placed on the ground under low bush and is made almost entirely of dead leaves it contains either four or ﬁve eggs which are dark olive brown all over north merican t hrushes there is long list of thrushes among our north american birds and some of them will compare well songsters with any of the woodland choristers of the world the voice of our robin carols sweetly enough in the spring but he is far excelled little later in the season by the the the veery and certain others which come from the south when the weather becomes warm some of these species the hermit and its relatives pass on into northern canada to make their nests and rear their young but fortunately among them queens of with us in the united states all summer of these the most commonly seen and heard is that richest of woodland musicians the whose serenely beautiful song in four parts separated by brief pauses ﬂoats to our ears from orchard and grove and shady roadside the quiet of the summer evening draws on and we begin to enjoy the coolness and peace of the twilight this eloquent thrush is reddish brown or bright cinnamon above brightest on the head and white below thickly ornamen ted with rounded black spots in lines from throat to thighs it is the least shy of all the thrushes except the robin yet gracefully modest in its demeanor it constructs its nest on the low horizontal limb of some tree always with the peculiarity that its foundation is layer of old sear leaves and that black rootlets are favorite material the walls the eggs are unspotted blue smaller and lighter than the greenish treasures in the cabin of the robin next in point of numbers though not so often recognized the is the oliveback which is distinctly olive in color on the back and ﬂanks and whose buffy underparts are unspotted save across the breast this species is highly variabl so that those of the paciﬁc coast differ considerably from those of the atlantic side of the continent the same is true of the which is heard only in the more norther n half of the continent in spring when its rich indescribable ﬂuting perhaps deserves the prize of superiority over all other american the veery or wilson tawny thrush is also noted its song which has an extraordinary quality which excites ﬁrst curiosity and then admiration the group of birds to which the thrush es belong is very large one and includes many smaller and variously colored birds among which are such familiar american friends the brown thrasher and its many cousins of the southwest the saucy mewing frequenter of every garden and blackberry thicket in the land those busybodies the wrens and many others wrens one would not at ﬁrst glance connect the great brown thrasher with the tiny which stuffs hole in one of the barn timbers or crevice in broken tree with mass of twigs surrounding soft little bed the eggs but when you closely compare the shape of bill and feet and their general form and manners the resemblance becomes more plain then you are not surprised to ﬁnd the rough nest and speckled eggs of the big thrasher and the tiny wren much alike and to ﬁnd resemblance in their songs much they dif fer in loudness wrens have curious way of beginning to build nests and leaving them half ﬁnished these are sometimes supposed to be the work of the male bird alone and are called 269 270 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https nests and certainly the cock does not seem to take any part in building the true nest he simply sits on branch close by and sings while the hen does all the work perhaps he is lazy or perhaps she thinks that she can build much better than he can and so will not let him help her and therefore it may be that he makes these cocks nests just to show her what he can but wrens are very timid birds and will often desert their nest if one even puts one ﬁnger inside it seems rather more likely that they are nests which the birds have left unﬁnished because they thought that some enemy had discovered them the d ipper not unlike very big wren with white throat and breast is the curiou s and interesting dipper well known to dwelle rs in the rocky mountains and the ranges west of them it is never found far from water and you may often see it perched upon stone in the shallows of river bobbing up and down every now and then just though it were making courtesy and every time that it does so it gives quick little jerk to its tail just the wren does it also makes nest of moss somewhat like that of the wren which is placed in hole in the bank of stream or often in crevice of the rocks behind cascade it feeds on insects and water and you may often see it busily hunting the little beetles which are hiding among the moss on the large stones in the bed of stream where it actually walks on the bottom it can swim and dive perfectly well and keeps itself beneath the surface by ﬂapping with its wings while it searches grubs in the mud at the bottom of the water the dipper has very bright and gay little song and always seems happy and busy and active swallows and m artins swallows and martins form very distinct group of small birds well known to everybody one can help noticing them they sail through the air in swift graceful circles or skim low over the water in constant pursuit of the tiny ﬂies which form their fare and are so small that vast numbers must be caught familiar too is their coming in the spring when they are welcomed the special sign of returning pleasant weather after the season of cold storms and in autumn we can not but notice them gathering in large ﬂocks along the telegraph lines or over the marshes preparatory to departing to their winter retreat in the tropics these characteristics well their to the swallows and martins all over the world and they are alike in all countries in their fearless fondness making close acquaintance with mankind when he dwells in settled homes common s wallows naturally these birds are inhabitants of caves and rocky cliffs or of hollow trees but like the swifts the moment man builds house or barn in europe or asia or south america there certain swallows are sure to come to live with him just they around our village and farm houses in north america hence the english people call their common species and we give the name to our similar one this is the very common species with the long deeply forked tail which sets its nest of mud and straw on the beams of our barns or plasters it against the walls or roof always inside the building almost equally widespr ead and numerous is another kind distinguished by its short square tail and its habit of forming nests wholly of mud and of placing them in rows outside the building close up under the eaves these last are better known

earth beside some river where usually large company live happy neighbors this species is one of the few birds known almost all over the world chapter xxiv parrots pigeons pheasants etc the members of the parrot family are very interesting birds in the ﬁrst place because they are generally so gaily colored in the second place because they are so easily tamed and in the third place because many of them are such capital talkers they nearly all spend the greater part of their lives in the trees and if you look at their feet you will see that the ﬁrst and fourth toes are turned backward while the second and third are directed forward this gives the birds great power of grasp and helps them in climbing at least ﬁve hundred different kinds of these birds have been discovered in different parts

macaw and then representing the various groups the g ray p arrot we take this parrot because it is the one which we see most often in cages it comes from central africa and like most parrots is generally seen in large ﬂocks which ﬂy about together during the daytime these birds often travel long distances in search of food which consists chieﬂy of fruits and nuts but in the evening they always return to their regular this parrot makes nest at all but just lays its eggs in hole in the trunk of tree both birds sit in turns and if danger threatens they will defend their eggs or their little ones with the greatest courage and if they seem to be getting the worst of the ﬁght it is said that the rest of the ﬂock will come to their rescue and will nearly always succeed in driving the enemy away when they are kept pets gray parrots nearly always learn to talk well and sometimes make such suitable remarks that it really almost seems if they must understand what they say that they live to very great age appears certain from the fact that they have sometimes been kept in captivity seventy or eighty years parrakeets these birds are found in the hotter parts of africa asia and australia being very plentiful instance in the forests of india perhaps the best known of them is the east indian parrakeet which is green in color the male having red ring round his neck with black ring underneath it the length of the bird is about seventeen inches of which almost exactly half is taken up by the tail these parrakeets are dreadfully mischievous birds they visit both ﬁelds and gardens and devour enormous quantities of grain and fruit you can easily understand how much harm four or ﬁve hundred of them can in short time and ﬂocks of this size are often seen while sometimes they are even larger still they have regular to which they always return at night and they lay their three or four white eggs in holes in trees cocka toos cockatoos may easily be recognized by their feathery crests which they can raise and lower at will we will take the sulphur cockatoo our example this favorite comes from australia where it is found in enormous ﬂocks fancy seeing thousand cockatoos ﬂying about together and fancy what it must be to listen to their screams yet ﬂock of this size is not at all uncommon the birds are not plentiful they used to be however they did so much mischief in the that the planters shot them in large numbers often indeed ﬁeld would be so full of cockatoos that from little distance it looked though it were deeply covered with snow talkers cockatoos are not nearly so clever parrots but they soon learn to imitate all kinds of sounds such the barking of dogs the mewing of cats the cackling of fowls and the gobbling of turkeys unfortunately however they are very fond of screaming and make terrible outcry if they are annoyed in any way so that they are apt to be rather nuisance if they are kept pets maca ws the macaws are large and handsome birds their plumage being nearly always very brightly and even gaudily colored in the red and blue macaw instance which is one of the best known the general color is bright vermilion red with patch of yellow feathers on the upper part of each wing then the lower part of the back togethe r with the quills of the wings and the outside feathers of the tail is blue while the central 274 275 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https are scarlet with blue tips but even this is not all underneath the wings and tail are golden red varied by patches of yellow feathers tipped with green this magniﬁcent bird is nearly three feet long of that length being occupied by the tail macaws are found in large ﬂocks in the great forests of tropical america where they may be seen sometimes ﬂying high in air and sometimes sitting on the topmost branches of the tallest trees their cries can be heard from very long distance away macaws are just mischievous in the cornﬁelds parrots and cockatoos are in other parts of the world and are much more difﬁcult to kill some before settling down to feed post sentinels in the tops of tall trees near by and steadily watchful they give the alarm soon they see the slightest sign of danger macaws lay their eggs in holes in parrots and are said to enlar ge the holes to suit their requirements by means of their powerful beaks they are not very wise birds however when they are sitting they often leave their long tails projecting out of the hole to be seen by every passer love irds of all the birds which belong to the parrot family the are the smallest being little bigger than ﬁnches seven different kinds are known all found in africa south of the desert of sahara these pretty little creatures are called because they seem so very fond of one another if two or three are kept in cage together they always snuggle up closely possible and will sit side by side hours perfectly happy in each other company and often if one of couple dies the other will pine away in short time and die too apparently from sorrow in wild state are generally seen in small ﬂocks which ﬂy very rapidly and constantly utter their sharp screaming cry they not seem to make any nests themselves but make use of those of other birds instead whether they turn out the rightful owners however or merely take possession of nests which have been deserted nobody seems to know pigeons we shall only be able to tell you about two members of the great pigeon family the ﬁrst of which shall be the or which is interesting the wild original that has given us our domestic pigeons so many varieties of which have been produced by fanciers this is very common bird in almost all parts of the british isles and one can scarcely walk through wood without startling it from its retreat in the thick foliage of some tall tree or ramble through the ﬁelds without seeing at least one ﬂock on its way to its unfortunately it does good deal of mischief it has most enormous appetite and carries off immense quantities of grain from the cornﬁelds just to give you some idea of the amount of food that it will eat we may mention that less than eight hundred grains of wheat have been taken from the crop of single pigeon six hundred peas from that of another and one hundred and eighty beechnuts from that of third while one naturalist tells us that the bird will sometimes pack away enough to ﬁll pint measure when they are well shaken up our american or is much like this but nobody minds the few bits of grain it picks up on the other hand the devours great quantities of the seeds of weeds so although it is mischievous in one way it is useful in another the nest of the which is mostly placed in the upper branches of tall tree is very clumsily made indeed it is very little more than platform of sticks which are often so loosely put together that you look up from below you can see the eggs through the gaps between them there are never more than two eggs which are perfectly white 276 277 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https p assenger igeon the passenger or wild pigeon of north america is remarkable two reasons in the ﬁrst place it is or rather used to be found in the most astonishing numbers flocks of these birds many miles in length have often been seen while large tracts of forest were once so thronged with their nests that all the smaller branches and many of the larger ones were broken down fancy what that means when is thirty miles long and several miles broad while many hundred nests may be found in single tree in the second place the bird is renown ed traveler that is why it is called the passenger all over the length and breadth of the country few years ago these vast ﬂocks would ﬂy coming man knows whence going man knows whither roosting just one night in one place and passing on again early next morning the ﬂocks are not so large they were however many millions of the birds have been destroyed and these pigeons never lay more than two eggs they not multiply very fast in fact this pigeon is already rare bird peacocks what magniﬁcent bird the peacock is with his great train raised and spread so to show off all the beautiful markings and how very proud of it he seems he struts about to be admired though knowing quite well that everybody is looking at him people sometimes speak of this train the tail but it really consists of those feathers which are called the the true tail lying underneath it and serving to support it when it is spread peacocks are natives of asia and are found most commonly perhaps in india where ﬂocks of thirty or forty may often be seen and one traveler tells us that he once saw quite ﬁfteen hundred of these splendid birds all together they are sometimes caught in very curious way the hunter rides up quietly to within short distance of them they are feeding on the ground and then suddenly dashes at them at full speed of course they at once rise into the air and just they are passing out of reach he strikes at one of them with very long whip which coils round its neck like lasso then all that he has to is to pull it down to the ground in some parts of india however these birds are regarded by the natives sacred and one is allowed to kill them or even to take them alive american game birds

in the especially at thanksgiving and christmas time many people think that it comes from the country of turkey but this is quite mistake it is native of north america in many parts of which it is still found in great abundance the domest icated turkey probably arose from the mexican variety rather than from the more familiar wild turkey of the northern states some of the ﬂocks seem to consist of cock birds only and others of hens and young the reason being that the cocks are very ﬁerce and quarrelsome birds and will attack and even kill the young ones if they have an opportunity until long after her little ones are ﬂedged indeed the mother turkey has to take the greatest care of them not only are they in constant danger from their unnatural father but all kinds of other enemies such foxes lynxes and horned owls have to be guarded against well so she keeps them nearly always under cover and when at last they are big enough to be taken little ramble she never brings them back to the nest by the path by which they left it turkeys often travel very long distances when they come to broad river they perch in the upper branches of the tallest trees they can ﬁnd and then ﬂy across

to shore pheasants the pheasant is native of southeastern europe and asia minor but it has lived in western europe so long that it is fully entitled to rank among british birds it has so many enemies however that if it were not carefully preserved it would very soon disappear pheasants nearly always live in woods though they often venture out into the open ﬁelds to search food which consists of acorns grain beechnuts seeds and small insects during the winter however they have to be fed or they would be very likely to die from starvation these birds not make regular nest the hen merely scratching slight hollow in the ground and there laying her ten to fourteen eggs when she is sitting it is difﬁcult to see her her mottled plumage looks just like the dead leaves among which she is resting and even the sharpest eye might often pass her by the r ed g rouse this bird is remarkable two reasons the ﬁrst is that it is found only in the british isles and not in any other part of the world and the second is that it varies so very greatly in color sometimes it is almost entirely black sometimes it is reddish chestnut and sometimes nearly all the feathers are broadly tipped with white the red grouse is found on moors and mountainsides wherever there is plenty of heath or heather and where it can obtain the whortleberries cranberries and tender shoots of and sedge upon which it feeds and though it has many natural enemies such hawks and crows foxes and stoats and while it is shot in thousands by sportsmen it never seems to decrease in abundance general rule the grouse does not ﬂy much but runs with great swiftness among the heather it makes very rough nest of straws and twigs in hollow in the ground and often sits so closely on its eggs that it may almost be trodden on before it will move when the little ones are hatched they seem to know without being taught how to conceal themselves in moments of danger and if they can not ﬁnd cover will ﬂatten themselves against the ground where they look so much like stones that even the sharp eye of hawk will pass them by 279 280 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https grea

of long and slender with scarcely any feathers on it next its wings are so small that they can not be used ﬂight all that an ostrich does with its wings indeed is to spread them out when it is running

toes on each foot ostriches live in the great desert plains of africa where they are mostly found in small ﬂocks although they can not ﬂy they can run with very great speed and in fair chase will distance even swift horse but some strange reason they always run in circles so that all that hunter has to is to notice whether they are swerving to the right or to the left and then to gallop across and cut them of when an ostrich is running at full speed it takes most wonderful strides its toes scarcely touching the ground it dashes along by careful measurement indeed it has been found that there is sometimes distance of less than feet between its footmarks the ostrich is rather formidable bird it can kick forward with terriﬁc force but if man lies down when attacked by one he is fairly safe the kick can not be properly delivered at height of less than three feet or if he has forked stick he can hold the bird back by pressing the fork against its neck ostriches eggs are so large that one of them will make good meal eight men the bird does not make nest but scoops out hollow in the sand about three feet across and foot deep and then arranges its eggs in it each egg standing upright and being lightly covered with sand twenty eggs or more are often hatched togethe r and in addition to these the bird generally lays number round the edges of the hole which appear to serve food the

natural food however consists chieﬂy of wild melons which also supply it with all the moisture that it needs ostriches are very valuable to man on account of the beautiful plumes which are obtained from the male these birds are therefore kept in great numbers in so that the plumes may be regularly cut once in every year this does not destroy the bird it is proper to make use of these beautiful

their appearance they always travel about with the cock cassow aries of these there are good many kinds they are formed like the ostrich and the emu but have shorter necks which are sometimes wattled and are marked with patches of brilliant red and blue and green the legs are stout and the feet are perfectly enormous but their most striking feature is an odd bony crest upon the top of the head which is covered with naked skin cassowaries are found only in austra lia new guinea ceram and some of the neighboring islands and unlike all the preceding birds are dwellers in the forest they are so shy that they are very seldom seen so that we not know very much about their habits the australian natives however often keep them in captivity and treat them almost we treat poultry but they are rather dangerous creatures they can kick very hard with their great strong feet and are very ready to attack any one who is stranger to them cassowaries only lay from three to ﬁve eggs and it seems that the cock bird alone sits on them and that he also takes care of the little ones after they are hatched kiwis more curious still are the kiwis of new zealand whose wings are so very smal l and so completely concealed under the feath ers of the body that practically they may be said to have none at all besides this the beak is so long and slender that it reminds one of that of woodcock or snipe the nostrils are placed at the very tip of this beak which the bird appears to use by plunging it deeply into soft ground and then smelling worms when it ﬁnds worm it seems to coax rather than to pull it out of the ground and then throws up its head and swallows it whole kiwis have several times been brought to the london zoo but hardly any one ever saw them all day long they were fast asleep among their straw if the keeper took them out and woke them they would just yawn once or twice opening their beaks to the widest possible extent and then fall fast asleep again after dark however these birds become very lively and will run with such speed that even dog can scarcely overtake them this shows that their natural habit is to go abroad and seek their food during the night the egg of the kiwi is enormously large indeed it is almost quarter of the size of the bird itself and when two eggs have been laid and the bird is sitting on them the ends project beyond the feathers on either side of its body bustards the bustards also are able to run very well and unlike the birds belonging to the ostrich family they are also able to ﬂy the ﬁnest of these birds is the great bustard which until about the year 1840 was found wild in great britain the cock is between three and four feet in height and the head and body together are nearly four feet long while when the wings are fully spread they measure quite eight feet from tip to tip the hen is good deal smaller the great bustard lives in wild open plains and is so extremely wary that it is almost impossible to approach within gunshot except during the nesting season it is found in small ﬂocks and both by day and by night two of the party act sentinels and stand always on the watch ready to give the alarm at the ﬁrst sign of danger they have wonderfully sharp sight and will detect man long before they can be seen by him 284 285 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https the only way to shoot them indeed is to dig pit in the ground and hide inside it covered over with branches until they pass by these magniﬁcent birds are now found chieﬂy in the steppes of eastern europe and asia where they feed upon seeds and grain and also upon insects and even upon small animals they lay two or three eggs in hollow in the ground in which sometimes but not always they place few by way of nest cranes another tall and stately bird is the crane it is found in one or another species in all quarters of the world living on plains and marshes coming north to breed and retiring southward again during the winter cranes generally travel about in ﬂocks which nearly always ﬂy in the form of wedge each bird having its long legs stretched stifﬂy out behind it each ﬂock is under the guidance of leader and the birds are most careful when they alight to so in some open place where they can see long distance in every direction so to guard against the danger of being surprised by an enemy cranes are generally to be seen in marshy districts where they can ﬁnd plenty of frogs newts and worms but sometime s they will make their way to newly sown ﬁeld and dig up all the grain their nests are generally placed on the ground among osiers or in though now and then they will build on the very top of an old ruin the little brown crane of the western plains is the most familiar american species the crowned crane which is found in northern and western africa is very looking bird it has large bunch of upright golden feathers on the top of its head and scarlet wattle on the throat from little distance it really looks if it were wearing bright yellow bonnet tied with bow of scarlet ribbon under its chin lapwings the european lapwing known to every one by the familiar reference in tennyson locksley hall represents the family of plovers they are beautiful birds with their black and white plumage and the tuft of long feathers at the back of the head and very often one may see hundreds or even thousands of them together early in the spring one may ﬁnd their four long pointed eggs which are olive brown in color spotted and blotched with brownish black and are always laid in little hollow in the bare ground with their small ends inward in the form of cross but somehow or other although they are quite large eggs it is very difﬁcult to see them and you might pass close by dozen nests and even look straight at them and yet never notice the eggs at all often when some one happens to ﬁnd hen lapwing sitting on her eggs she will pretend to be wounded and will ﬂap and tumble along the ground in the hope of making the intruder chase her and so of leading him away from her nest sportsmen know of many other plovers such the golden the ringneck the killdee or killdeer and several more both american and foreign the c urlew this is another common to both continents which may often be noticed on moors or in marshes during the summer or on the in the winter but generally one only sees it in the distance it is extremely wary and takes to ﬂight at the very slightest alarm all through the winter months curlews live in ﬂocks and one may hear them uttering their mournful cries in chorus together but early in the spring they separate and each pair selects some little hollow in the ground which may serve nest in this they lay four eggs which are olive green in color spotted with gray and brown when the eggs are hatched the parents take the greatest care of their little ones and often 286 287 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https any one comes too near the nest they will ﬂy round and round his head in the most excited manner and their very best to drive him away in color the curlew is pale brown abov with darker spots and streaks and grayish white beneath its total length is about inches and the beak is long and slender with downward curve ruffs the ruff relative of the curlew is remarkable three reasons in the ﬁrst place during the the male bird has great frill or ruff of long feath ers round his neck which he can raise and lower at will in the next place two male ruffs are never colored alike while sometimes they look so wholly different that it is quite hard to believe that they can really belong to the same species and in the third place they are so dreadfully quarrelsome when the begins that two male ruffs can never meet without ﬁghting more than that they actually have regular laces to which numbers of the birds resort when they want to settle their quarrels but although they ﬁght very savagely they never seem to each other much harm ruffs are hardly known in america except in alaska but at one time they were very common in the marshy parts of england the w oodcock the woodcock is bird of wooded swamps it is valued by sportsmen because difﬁcult to shoot and delicate to eat they lay their eggs in hollow in the ground which they line with dry grass and leaves when the mother bird is sitting it is almost impossible to see her she nearly always nests among dead ferns which are of exactly the same hues her own plumage generally indeed it is her eyes that are noticed and if she only had the sense to keep them shut she would probably never be detected at all woodcocks are hardly ever seen unless they are disturbed they hide during the daytime in thick bushes in woods and only come out to feed in the evening their food consists chieﬂy of worms which they pull out of soft muddy ground by mean s of their long slender beaks if two male woodcocks meet during the they almost always quarrel and will ﬁght nearly savagely ruf fs the s nipe in appearance and habits the snipe is something like the woodcock but it is considerably smaller and is found in damp marshy ground instead of in woods when it is ﬂushed it ﬂies away few yards quite straight and then begins to twist and turn about in most extraordinary way changing the direction of its ﬂight at almost every yard in consequence of this habit it is not at all an easy bird to shoot the male snipe is very fond of rising to great height in the air and there uttering his curious cry of chick chick over and over again at the same time he also makes strange drumming sound whic h seems to be caused in some way by the motion of the wings it is only produced while he is stooping down toward the ground the snipe generally nests in the middle of tussock of coarse grass or rushes where it lays four buf f or eggs marked with blotches the h eron one of our ﬁnest american birds is the heron which you may often see ﬂying high in the air with its long legs stretched stifﬂy out behind it and sometimes you may see it standing quite motionless in the shallower parts of stream watching the ﬁshes on which it feeds after time it will slowly stoop plunge its long beak into the water and draw it out again with minnow or perch or frog struggling in its grip then it holds its beak almost upright gives gobble and the ﬁsh or the frog disappears 288 289 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https heron feeds largely on frogs mice insects and worms well upon ﬁshes and more than once it has been known to capture and swallow small snake herons build their nests in the upper branches of tall trees making them of sticks and twigs lined with grass and roots number of these birds generally nest together in the same clump of trees just rooks and in each nest are laid either three or four green eggs without any markings at all if heron is attacked it uses its long dagger beak with great readiness and always tries to strike at the eyes of its enemy herons are of many kinds the great blue one being the ﬁnest of the tribe storks the stork is found in most parts of europe and also in asia and northern africa but stork lives in america when storks are migrating they ﬂy in great ﬂocks which sometimes consist of many thousand birds soon they arrive they spread themselves over the country being especially fond of marshy districts where they can ﬁnd plenty of frogs toads lizards and the other small creatures upon which they feed but they also devour large quantities of the of fal which they ﬁnd in the streets of the villages and towns in holland and germany storks breed in great numbers their nests which are usually placed on the tops of chimneys are little more than clumsy piles of sticks and fresh sticks are added every year they gradually get bigger and bigger until at last they reach very great size from three to ﬁve pure white eggs are laid and the young birds remain in the nest until they are well able to ﬂy the i bis very much like storks in some ways are the ibises which are found in many parts of asia africa and america they are generally found in ﬂocks which live in marshes or on the banks of rivers and lakes where they spend most of their time dabbling in the water with their long beaks in search of food one of these birds was worshiped by the egyptians of old who treated it with the greatest reverence during life and carefully embalmed its body when it died this reason it is known the sacred ibis and in every large art museum you may see ibis mummies which were taken from the tombs of the kings in color this bird is snowy white with black head and neck and long black plumes on the hinder part of the back you may generally see it in zoo together with the beautiful scarlet ibis whose plumage is bright red in color with black tips to the wings chapter xxvi swimming birds in the birds belonging to this group the feet are webbed so that they may be used paddles and some of them are very curious indeed flamingo first of all there is the red and white ﬂamingo which is quite an extraordinary bird it has extremely long legs and an extremely long like neck which it can twist and coil about easily if it were just piece of rope there is part of its body which ﬂamingo can not reach with its beak so that it can preen its feathers quite easily and when it wants to feed it wades into the water bends 290 291 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https its long neck turns its head upside down so that its forehead rests upon the bottom and scoops up great mouthfuls of mud then by means of the groov es at the sides of the bill it gets rid of the mud while all the grubs which were lying buried in it are left behind to be swallowed the nest of the ﬂamingo is ed heap of mud sometimes much two feet high with little hollow at the top to contain eggs thousands of these birds nest together and when they are sitting they look just like great cloud resting upon the ground and if they are startled and ﬂy away their nests look though hundreds of children had been making big on the beach and neatly arranging them in rows but such sight this can now be seen only in some almost inaccessible tropical islands these birds have been greatly persecuted by feather and others and are rare everywhere near civilization they used to be common in florida and all about the gulf of mexico where now only few exist flamingoes are found in the warmer parts of all the great continents except australia nine dif ferent kinds are known some of which stand well over six feet in height geese s wans and d ucks of wild geese there are at least forty species which are found in almost all parts of the world the graylag goose which breeds in the british isles seems to be the ancestor of the domestic geese that we see in every farmyard it lives in ﬂocks which frequent marshes lakes and boggy moors during the greater part of the year but often visit the in winter sometimes too they may be seen near the mouth of great river they are very shy birds and when sportsmen wish to shoot them they have to resort to all kinds of tricks in order to approach them without being seen when wild geese ﬂy they generally so in the form of pair of compasses with the angle in front but now and then they may be seen in the air in an irregular wavy line they ﬂy they make curious gaggling cry which can be heard from very long distance the nest of this goose is made of grass and ﬂags and is generally placed at the base of tussock of coarse grass it usually contains six plain white eggs swans too are found wild in many parts of the world and used to be almost numerous ducks or geese both on the inland lakes and along the coasts of the united states but now have become rare and shy all the species breed in the arctic regions and appear among us only on their migrations in spring and fall swans are most graceful birds in the water and their limbs are set very far back they can swim with great ease but the same reason they are very clumsy upon dry ground and waddle along in the most awkward way seeming to ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to keep their balance all those in our parks are tame but during the eason the male swan generally becomes very savage and will attack any one who ventures too near to his nest and single stroke from his wing is sufﬁcient to break man arm he is apt to be dangerous when unfriendly the nest of the swan is very large structure of reeds rushes and grass and is generally placed quite close to the water edge it contains six or seven large white eggs great many kinds of duck are known but we can only mention the common wild duck which still visits rivers and lakes every winter in considerable numbers few of which remain to breed the male duck is called the mallard and from october till may he is very handsome bird with head and neck white collar round the lower part of his throat wings breast and white hinder parts but when he moults he puts off this beautiful plumage and the next ﬁve months is mottled all over with brown and gray just like his mate wild ducks are found chieﬂy in marshes and fens and on the borders of river s and lakes but when they come over in the autumn they often spend the daytime out at sea 292 293 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https on the water they make their nests of grass lined with down from the mother bird own breast and the little ones are able to swim soon they leave the when they are about half grown they sometimes use their wings in diving and you may see them ﬂapping their way along beneath the surface and really ﬂying under water cormorants in great britain due to its northern latitude cormorants are commonly seen where the coast is high and rocky but in america they are less often visible because they dwell mainly in the far north they are very odd birds sitting on rocks which overhang the water every now and then one will drop into the sea splash about moment or two and then return to his perch then you may be quite sure that he has caught and swallowed ﬁsh sometimes you may see them swimming along with their heads under water watching victims in the depths below cormorants are famous their big it would be more correct to say their horrible greediness they will go on eating till they simply can not swallow another morsel and yet will try hard to catch every ﬁsh that comes near them the little ones feed in most extraordinary way they actually poke their heads down their mother throat and take much food they want from her crop when these birds really feel that they have had enough to eat they sit upon rock an hour or two while they digest their dinners they also take this opportunity to dry their wings and spread them out to the fullest extent on either side so that they look very much like rows of black clothes hung out to dry in china cormorants are often trained to catch ﬁsh their masters strap being fastened round the lower part of the neck to prevent them from swallowing their victims they were formerly used in england in just the same way pelicans more curious still are their cousins the pelicans which have pouch of naked skin under their long bills capable of holding quite two gallons of water this pouch rule is folded closely up under the beak but when the bird is ﬁshing it packs victim after victim into it until it is quite full when it really looks almost half big the body in this way pelicans carry back food their hungry little ones but on their way they are sometimes robbed there is kind of large hawk which is very fond of eating ﬁshes but is not at all fond of the trouble of catching them so he waits till he sees pelican returning home from ﬁshing expedition and then dashes at it and begins to beat it about the head with his wings the poor frightened pelican thinking that it is about to be killed opens its beak to scream this of course is just what the hawk wants and snatching ﬁsh out of the pelican pouch he ﬂies of f with it in triumph pelicans are very plentiful in many parts of the world and are often seen in vast ﬂocks we have two kinds in the unite d states and white and the brown both are more numerous on the marshes and around the shallow lakes of the northwestern plains than anywhere else because they have been driven from their former all the birds in ﬂock will sometimes go out ﬁshing together arranging themselves in great semicircle about yard apart they all paddle slowly forward and in this way will drive great shoal of ﬁsh into shallow water where they may be snapped up without difﬁculty ulls these you know very well by sight they are common on all parts of our coasts and on many of our lakes while numbers of them may be seen even on the ornamental waters in the parks of new york and other seaboard cities in stormy weather too they often ﬂy inland and sometimes great numbers of them may be seen in newly plowed ﬁelds hunting worms and insects most of them go north the 294 295 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https visiting certain islands and rocky cliffs in immense numbers and making their nests of seaweed while others like the gull and the ringbill nest in marshes merely trampling down the broken tops of sedges and reeds and so forming slight hollow in which to lay the eggs at least ﬁfty different kinds of gulls are known but many of them are very difﬁcult to distinguish their summer plumage may be quite unlike that with which they are clothed during the winter while the young birds are not marked like their parents till they are two or even three years old those which are most common on the atlantic coast are two or three kinds of which formerly bred in great numbers on all our sandy shores and islets but now have been driven to quieter regions in the far north on the western plains around certain shallow lakes live great colonies of illed and other small gulls breeding in the extensive marshes flying to and fro over the sea or over large inland lake you may sometimes see number of birds which look like gulls but are much smaller and have long forked tails like swallows these are terns or they are often called and are most elegant and graceful in their moveme nts gliding and sweeping through the air and twisting and turning with the most wonderful swiftness and ease they are summer visitors only coming to us in may and ﬂying south again in september and they breed on ﬂat shores generally laying their two or three eggs in small hollow in the shingle they feed on small ﬁshes and shrimps and also on the sandhoppers and the various insects which are so plentiful upon the beach american wading birds great white egret sandhill crane great blue heron whooping crane white pelican male snow goose guillemots very common are guillemots on some coasts where there are cliffs and freedom from disturbance thus they abound along the shores of labrador and greenland and many varieties are to be found along the northern coasts of alaska and about the borders of the arctic sea often thronging in great numbers together with 296 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https kittiwakes petrels and gannets each kind occupying separate parts of the cliffs and living on friendly terms with their neighbors guillemots feed entirely upon ﬁshes which they chase under water using both their wings and feet just dabchicks they not make any nest but lay single egg on bare ledge of rock which is often only very few inches wide one would think that this egg would be in great danger of being knocked over the edge but it is very large at one end and very much pointed at the other so that if it is struck it only rolls round and round in color it is green or blue blotched and streaked with black the lba tross one of the largest of all the is the albatross which is found chieﬂy in the tropical seas when the wings are fully spread they sometimes measure nearly twelve feet from tip to tip yet the entire weight of the bird is not more than sixteen or seventeen pounds it often remains at sea week s or months together sometimes remaining in the air all through the night well all through the day and following ships hundreds of miles in order to feed upon the refuse which is thrown overboard its appetite is enormous it has been known to gulp down great piece of whale blubber weighing between three and four pounds and then to return almost immediately more great numbers of albatrosses nest together on uninhabited islands each pair scooping together quantity of clay grass and sedge which they arrange in conical heap about ten or twelve inches high with little hollow at the top only single egg is laid which is quite white and is rather lar ger than that of goose the p uffin and the p enguin two most curious birds must be mentioned in conclusion the ﬁrst of these is the pufﬁn which is found plentifully in one or another species on all northern coasts where there are bold cliffs an odder and more bird it would be difﬁcult to imagine it has beak quite large enough bird six times its size while that beak which is banded with bright crimson gray and brilliant yellow looks just if it had been stuck on with glue more than that it does not appear to ﬁt very well so that altogether with its short squat body and stout little legs the pufﬁn is by means graceful bird it is often known the on dry land the pufﬁn is very awkward and can only waddle along slowly and clumsily but it is good swimmer and diver and can chase and overtake small ﬁshes with the greatest of ease it is also able to ﬂy very well and takes long journeys over the sea when it comes to us in the spring and again when it goes southward in the autumn it makes nest but ﬁnds cranny digs out hole in the face of cliff to the depth of about three feet and lays single egg at the end of the hole odder still is the penguin whose wings are but little more than ﬂippers with scales on their upper edges instead of feathers it can not ﬂy of course but it uses its wings two purposes if it is frightened upon land it throws itself down on its breast and scuttles along on all fours just though its wings were legs and if it wants to chase ﬁsh in the sea it swims with them just though they were paddles there are good many different kinds of penguins all of which are found in the southern hemisphere on some of the islands in the paciﬁc and antarctic oceans they are found in immense numbers and have curious way of standing side by side upon the shore in long rows with their ﬂippers hanging down on either side of their bodies from distance indeed they might almost be mistaken lines of soldiers standing at attention when the begins they become very busy picking up stones carrying them about with great deal of fuss and then carefully arranging them in position every now and then turning their beaks up to the sky waving their ﬂippers and making curious gobbling noise if sitting hen leaves her nest little all the other hens become greatly excited and peck at her she passes by in order to drive her back again croaking loudly in chorus and evidently feeling extremely indignant with her neglecting her duties 297 298 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https these odd birds are sitting on ledge of ice and want to get down into the sea they often throw themselves upon their breasts and toboggan down the slope into the water reptiles chapter xxvii tortoises tur tles and lizards we now come to the animals which are divided into three classes first we have the reptiles whose hearts are formed of three chambers and which breathe air by means of lungs next come the amphibians which are like the reptiles in many ways but which have to pass through tadpole stage before they reach the perfect form and thirdly there are the ﬁshes whose hearts are divided into two chambers only and which breathe water by means of gills tortoises and t urtles at the head of the reptiles stand the tortoises and turtles whose bodies are shut up in kind of horny box which we generally call the shell in reality however it is not shell at all the upper part which we call the carapace is development of the spine and the ribs while the lower part which is known the plastron is development of the these animals in fact have part of their skeletons inside their bodies and part outside so that they are really shut up in their own bones the shell of tortoise or turtle is always very hard and strong so that you can stand upon quite small tortoise without hurting it in the least and in most cases the head and legs can be tucked away inside it so that the animal is safely protected from almost every foe none of the turtles and tortoises have any teeth but the edges of their jaws are so sharp and horny that they can often inﬂict very severe bite some of the larger turtles indeed could snap off the ﬁngers of man hand easily you could bite through carrot 299 300 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of mandarin duck penguin heron pelican bittern flamingo crane land ortoises the most famous of all the tortoises is the common or greek tortoise which is found in many parts of the south of europe and also in asia minor this is the animal which is so often kept pet and about which so much pleasant literary interest has gathered it does not grow to any great size but will live in garden many years crawling about by night well by day early in the autumn it buries itself under ground and falls into deep sleep from which it does not awake until the spring this tortoise is and is very fond of lettuce leaves more especially when they are quite crisp and fresh so that it can easily nip them to pieces with its sharp jaws if they are rather old and stringy it will hold them down with its front feet while it tears them asunder and if you keep one of these animals pet and want to give it great treat there is nothing that it likes better than little milk it is amusing to see how it drinks it ﬁrst scoops up little milk in its lower jaw just if it were using spoon and then holds up its head in order that the liquid may trickle down its throat there are good many other kinds of some of which grow to very great size the largest of all comes from the galapagos islands and is quite giant some of them are more than four feet long and weigh between eight and nine hundred pounds these huge creatures however are now nearly extinct turtles the turtles are distinguished from the tortoises by the structure of their feet which are ﬂattened out in such way to serve paddles in the water this reason the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https hardly ever come upon land except when they want to lay their eggs and they can swim so well that they are often met with many hundreds of miles out at sea one of the best known of these creatures is the hawksbill turtle which is so called because its mouth is shaped just like the beak of hawk the carapace is made up of thirteen large scales which overlap one another about third of their length just like the slates on the roof of house these scales are very valuable the best is obtained from them when they are ﬁrst taken from the animal they not look like at all they are dull and crumpled and brittle but after they have been boiled and steamed and pressed some hours they quite change their character and become so soft that they can easily be molded into any required shape the eggs of this turtle are laid in hole which the mother scrapes in the sand and are hatched by the heat of the sun soon the little turtles make their appearance they hurry off fast they can toward the water but they are very good to eat and number of hungry animals and birds are always on the lookout them so that very great many are snapped up and devoured before they can plunge into the waves the famous turtle soup which is considered so great dainty is made from the ﬂesh of the green turtle which is found most plentifully off the island of ascension and in the west indies it grows to great size it is often four feet six inches in length and three feet in breadth while it may weigh nearly of ton of course it is not at all easy to capture such big creatures but they are generally pursued when they come on shore to lay their eggs and are turned over on their backs by means of lever they are then perfectly helpless and can be left lying where they are until number of others have been overturned in the same way when they are lifted into boat one by one and are taken on board ship there they thrive quite well if pail of water is thrown over them two or three times day and are generally in very good condition when they reach this country it is said that if one of these turtles has once begun to lay her eggs in the sand nothing will induce her to pause in her task until she has ﬁnished it and that even if the eggs are taken away from her fast she lays them she will still go steadily on just if she were undisturbed crocodiles and lliga tors of course you know what these huge creatures are like they are just enormous lizards ﬁfteen or twenty or even thirty feet long with very short legs and very clumsy bodies and very long tails and their great jaws are armed with rows of most terrible teeth but what is the difference between crocodiles and alligators well in some ways they are certainly very much alike but you can always tell them by the shape of their heads the muzzle of crocodile is always narrowed just behind the nostrils while that of an alligator is not and in the crocodiles the fourth lower tooth ﬁts into notch in the edge of the upper jaw so that you can distinctly see it even when the mouth is closed all these creatures live in the water and spend great deal of their time lying motionless on the surface when they look like ﬂoating logs one would think that they were fast asleep but woe betide any animal which comes to drink from the bank close by one of the great reptiles instantly dives swims swiftly along under water and knocks it into the stream by blow from its mighty tail there is scarcely any animal which does not fall victim at times to these giant lizards and soon the unfortunate creature is knocked into the water it is dragged beneath the surface and held there until it is drowned you would think that the reptiles themselves would be drowned would you they have to remain submer ged many minutes with their jaws widely opened but they have very curious valve at the back of the throat and soon the mouth is opened this closes so tightly that not even the tiniest drop of water can ﬁnd its way down the throat 301 302 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https crocodiles and alligators swim with very great speed by waving their powerful tails from side to side in the water they can run too with some little pace upon land but it is very easy to avoid them the bones of their necks are made in such way that they can not turn their heads and all that one has to if pursued is to spring suddenly to one side but of course it is necessary to avoid the stroke of the tail the crocodiles always lay their eggs in the sand on the bank of river the eggs are about big those of goose and are generally buried at depth of couple of feet the mother reptile always sleeps on the top of the nest and it is said that when the little ones are ready to hatch out they utter curious little cry the mother hears this and scoops away the sand under which they are buried in order that they may have difﬁculty in making their escape crocodiles are found in the warmer parts of africa asia america and australia and in some of the larger rivers are very plentiful just now and then they venture down into the sea alligators which also are known caymans and jacares are only found in america and place their eggs in holes dug in the mud or earth beside the water in the colder parts of the range they burrow under the mud of the banks and spend the winter in sleep the l izards lizards look at ﬁrst glance like diminutive alligators because most of them have heads short legs wide apart and long tails but really they are near relatives of the snakes not only their internal structure but the coat of scales is but an important difference is that the jaws of the lizard are ﬁrmly hinged to solid skull while the bones of the skull of the snake including those of the jaws are connected by elastic cartilages which enable them to spread apart and permit the swallowing of mouthful astonishingly large but the lizards have need of such convenience they subsist almost wholly on insects or else are lizards are almost entirely denizens of the tropics and seem to rejoice in the ﬁercest heat they will lie contentedly in the desert at noonday on rocks so hot that they would blister your hand if you touched them therefore few are to be found in europe or north america except in the extreme south the b lindworm two or three small kinds are to be found in the south of england one of which is curious representing tribe largely represented in other parts of the world of legless burrowing lizards which look much like little snakes none of them are more than ten or twelve inches long while they are of the thickness of they look so shiny and that many people are afraid of them but the blindworm or slowworm this creature is called is perfectly harmless it can not bite you its teeth are far too tiny to pierce the skin and it can not sting you because it has sting there is its odd little forked tongue of course which is always darting in and out of its mouth just like that of snake but this tongue is only feeler whenever blindworm comes to an object it does not quite understand it touches it gently all over with the tip of its tongue just we might touch it with the tips of our ﬁngers notwithstanding its name the blindworm has pair of very good though rather small beady black eyes and of course it is not worm during the daytime the blindworm mostly lies hidden under large stone and on turning such stone over one may sometimes ﬁnd two or three of these lizards all coiled up together but in the evening they leave their and go out to search the tiny white slugs on which they feed when it is suddenly startled the blindworm sometimes behaves in very odd way it stiffens its body gives kind of shudder and twist and actually snaps off its own tail then the tail begins to writhe about on the ground wriggling and curling and even leaping up into the air in the most curious manner and while you are watching its antics 303 304 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https blindworm creeps away into some place of safety you would think that it must suffer great deal of pain from this extraordin ary injury would you and that the blindworm would feel it quite much man would feel if his leg were cut off but it does not seem to suffer at all and stranger still new tail very soon begins to grow in the place of the old one so that in the course of very few weeks the lizard is just perfect it was before skinks these are queer little lizards with four short legs and very stumpy tails which are found in many parts of africa and asia they live in sandy deserts and are rather slow in their movements rule but if ﬂy should settle anywhere near them they will dart upon it with the most surprising quickness and will hardly ever fail to capture it and if they are alarmed they will burrow into the sand so rapidly that they really seem to sink into it just if it were water in very few seconds indeed they will bury themselves to depth of at least two or three feet in olden days skinks were very much used in medicine and the powder obtained from their dried bodies was thought to be certain cure many diseases it does not seem very nice idea yet even to this day skinks are used the same purpose in eastern countries there are several different kinds of these curious lizards of which the common skink found in northern africa is the best known it is about three inches and half in length and is yellowish brown in color with number of darker bands on the sides of the body geckos odder still are the geckos which have their toes swollen out at the tips into round sucker pads by means of which they can climb wall or pane of glass with the greatest ease or even walk about like ﬂies on the ceiling they are very fond of getting into houses generally remaining hidden in some dark corner during the day but coming out toward evening to search insects and continually uttering their curious little cry of people used to be very much afraid of geckos some thinking that they could squirt out poison from the pads of their toes which would act like the sting of nettle and others declaring that their teeth were so sharp and strong that they could pierce even sheet of steel but the real fact is that these lizards are perfectly harmless and can not injure any living creature except the insects upon which they feed when they take up their quarters in house they soon become extremely tame and will even climb up on the dinner to be fed geckos are found in almost all hot countries of the old world and nearly three hundred dif ferent kinds have been found altogether iguanas american lizards are almost wholly members of the numerous iguana family which takes its name from the big examples found from mexico down into brazil the commonly known one when fully grown will measure four feet from the tip of its blunt head to the end of its long tapering tail it looks rather forbidding row of sharp spikes runs right along its back while under its chin is great dewlap yet it is not quite so terrible it seems though it will bite ﬁercely if it is driven to bay and use its long tail like the lash of whip it will always run away if it can and will either climb into the topmost boughs of tree or plunge into stream and swim away this reptile is very good swimmer driving itself rapidly through the water by waving its long tail from side to side just like crocodile or an alligator and it can dive beneath the surface and remain at the bottom very long time without coming up to breathe 305 306 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https live chieﬂy among the branch es of trees which overhang the water their ﬂesh is very good to eat it is tender the breast of young chicken their eggs too which they bury in the sand on the are often used food and it is said that matter how long they may be boiled they never become hard various merican l izards the hot open plains which stretch from central texas westward to the paciﬁc ocean and northward in utah and nevada abound in great variety of small lizards none more than eighteen inches or so in length some are fat and some slender and swift with tails like whiplashes some have gay colors and the power of changing them more or less while others are dull of hue and uninteresting or repulsive to look at mostly they are but some subsist upon plants and one of the latter is the big fat one known in southern california the alderman another strange one is the broad ﬂat creature so frequently seen all over the southwest and called horned toad on account of its shape and habit of sitting on its squat legs with its tail tucked sideways out of sight it is covered almost all over with long and sharp spikes those on its head which are directed backward are the longest and from these it gets its name of horned toad but those on the back are very nearly long while there are several rows upon the tail well yet it is perfectly harmless even when it is caught the ﬁrst time it never seems to use either its spikes or its teeth but it has another peculiarity which it sometimes uses means of defence and that is very strange one indeed it actually squirts out little jets of blood from its eyes that seems impossible does it yet there is doubt at all about it when these lizards have been kept in captivity and have been rather roughly handled they have been known to squirt several drops of blood at time to distance of twelve or ﬁfteen inches yet nobody seems to know how they it the g ila m onster this same region however contains poisonous only kind of lizard in the world known to have sacs of venom in the mouth this venom enters any wound made by the animal biting with certain teeth and acts upon the animal bitten like poison this is sluggish creature which dwells in the sandy plains along the mexican boundary and is called the gila monster or scientiﬁcally the heloderma its scales are rounded so that this lizard looks if dressed in pebbled goatskin and its colors are black and yellow in irregular blotches the hunters and are more afraid of it than need be it is sleepy and will never use its poisonous teeth without great provocation so that it is only necessary to leave it alone in order to escape any harm the f rilled l izard this lizard is native of australia and has round its neck kind of frill or ruff from six to eight inches in diameter rule this frill is folded round the throat so that from little distance one would scarcely notice it but soon the reptile is excited or alarmed it spreads it out sits on its hinder legs and its tail raises its head and body and shows its teeth just if it were going to ﬂy at its enemy this is only pretence however though the lizard grows to length of nearly three feet it is quite harmless another very curious habit which this lizard has is that of walking upright on its hind legs in the attitude of dog when begging it will even run in this position and most odd it then looks it is capital climber and spends most of its life in the trees to which it always tries to escape when it thinks itself in danger in color the frilled lizard is yellowish brown mottled with black the c hameleon 307 308 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of all strange lizards however is the chameleon in the ﬁrst place this lizard has very long tongue which it can dart out to really wonderful distance from its mouth this tongue looks very much like worm and is exceedingly sticky so that all that chameleon has to when it sees ﬂy settling near it is to dart out its tongue and touch it with the tip then the ﬂy adheres to it and is carried back into the mouth so quickly that it is almost impossible to see what becomes of it in this way it can catch ﬂy at distance of fully six inches then the chameleon has most extraordi nary eyes they are about big peas but instead of having lids which move up and down ours they are entirely covered by the lids with the exception of just tiny round space in the middle the lizard sees in fact through hole in the middle of its eyelid that is strange enough but what is stranger still is that the animal can move its eyes in different directions at the same time they are hardly ever still single moment but instead of moving together like those of all other animals one may be looking upward toward the sky and the other downward toward the ground or the right eye may be peering forward in front of the nose while the left one is glancing backward toward the tail indeed it would be very difﬁcult to ﬁnd an odder sight than that of chameleon when it is moving its eyes about they really look just if they belonged to two dif ferent animals but the most wonderful fact of all about the chameleon is that it can change its color whenever it chooses how it does so one quite knows but the very same animal which is brown all over it sits upon branch will become green all over if you put it among leaves the last thing at night probably you will ﬁnd that it is gray next day perhaps brown spots will appear upon its body and pinkish stripes upon its sides and occasionally it may be violet and sometimes yellow and sometimes nearly black so that if you were to go and look at chameleon and then go and look at it again half an hour afterward you might very likely take it wholly dif ferent animal then the chameleon has very odd habits if it is annoyed example it puffs out its body in the most extraordinary way till it is nearly double its ordinary size and its skin is stretched almost tight the parchment of drum when it is caught it hisses like snake and really it must be the very laziest creature on earth if it lifts foot into the air it will often wait quite minute before it puts it down again and two or even three minutes more before it takes second step then it always has to rest some little time after uncoiling its tail from branch while when it coils it round another it stops and rests again it will hardly travel two yards in fact in day chameleons are found in many parts of africa and asia and also in southeastern europe chapter xxviii snakes there are great many different kinds of snakes but before we read about some of them we must tell you some thing about the wonderful way in which their bodies are made in the ﬁrst place then remember that snakes have very large number of those sections or pieces forming the spine which we call vertebræ we ourselves have only of these little parts when we begin life and afterward this difference in number being caused by the fact that ﬁve of the joints very soon unite into bony mass at the lower end which we call sacrum while four more unite into another which we call the coccyx but some snakes have hundreds of these vertebræ the boas example have less than three hundred and four 309 310 311 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https the next place remember that all these vertebræ are fastened together by what we call joints that is there is round knob at the back of each vertebra which ﬁts into socket in front of the vertebra behind it this gives to the spine of snake great strength vertebra can not be forced out of its place without breaking the vertebra behind it and it also allows the spine to be curled and twisted about in almost any direction so that snake can easily coil up its body like spring or even tie it into knot then remember that snake has great many ribs we have twelve pairs of these important bones most of which are jointed to the in front but snake may have many two hundred and pairs of ribs while it has at all so that the tips of all the ribs are free and every rib is fastened to verteb ra of the spine by joint just like those which fasten the vertebræ themselves together besides this there are less than ﬁve separate sets of muscles connected with the ribs so that the snake can move those bones about quite easily it is really by means of its ribs that snake is able to glide over the ground if you were to look at the under side of snake body you would see that the scales are quite different from those on the upper part on the back and sides the scales are quite small and are almost oval or oblong but on the abdomen they are very long and very narrow and are set crosswise like the laths of venetian blind characteristic forms and markings of american birds eggs owl guillemot tern skimmer water owl ducks waders heron gallinule snowy plover stilt sandpiper ring plover game irds partridge ptarmigan birds of p rey owl falcon cuckoos cuckoo roadrunner song irds mockingbird towhee finch sparrow oriole blackbird grakle flycatcher rosbin thrush woodhouse jay now the tips of every pair of ribs in snake body are fastened to one of these long abdominal scales in such manner that when the snake moves the ribs forward the edge 312 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https the scale is much you can raise the laths of the venetian blind by pulling the cord at the side and the snake travels by moving forward its ribs in turn and catching hold of the ground with the edges of the scales using ﬁrst the ribs of one side and then of the other when snake is crawling however it does not curve its body into upright loops inaccurate pictures sometimes represent but keeps it pressed ﬂat upon the ground so that the scales may be able easily to take hold of any little roughness upon the surface and when it climbs tree it does not twine its body round and round the trunk but crawls straight up it just it crawls along the ground the mouth of snake is very curiously made we are not speaking now of the fangs of the poisonous serpents we will tell you about these by and by but remember that the mouth must be made in very strange way in order to allow these creatures to swallow their victims which are often good deal lar ger round than their own throats it sounds impossible yet the snake can swallow an animal larger in diameter than its own throat because the bones of its jaws instead of being ﬁrmly fastened together ours are can be forced long way apart so to make room the carcass to pass besides this it has less than six separate four in the upper part of the mouth and two in the lower every one of which is set with sharp hooked teeth and the points of these teeth are directed toward the throat now every one of these can be moved backward and forward at will so when snake wishes to swallow the body of victim it ﬁrst of all seizes it in its mouth and then pushes one of the forward and takes ﬁrm hold with the teeth then it pushes another forward and then third and then fourth and so it goes on each time taking fresh hold with the hooked teeth till at last the carcass is forced into the mouth then the bones separate so to make plenty of room it to pass and the alternate action of the jaws goes on before till the carcass is forced into the throat and then the ﬂesh of the throat which is very elastic stretches out too till before very long the carcass disappears altogether then the eyes of snakes are made in very curious way the eyelids which are quite transparent not open and shut ours but cover the eyes altogether so snake can not blink and it looks at you through its own eyelids which are very much like little fastened into the skin when snake throws off its skin which it always does once in year and sometimes oftener the eyelids are thrown off with it and pair of new ones are found lying below all ready to take their place just while this is happening and it may take day or two the creature is trying to look through double layer of and can see very poorly until the outer one slips off this is the explanation of the popular saying that snakes are blind in august the usual time harmless s nakes all serpents may properly enough be divided into two ones which are harmless so far their bite is concerned and the poisonous ones which inject more or less deadly venom into wounds made by certain long teeth called fangs let us consider ﬁrst moment the harmless ones the great majority of of the common snakes of the whole to single family called colubers and this family far outnumbers all other serpents most of its members are of small size few exceed two yards in length one of the exceptions being our handsome of texas and westward which is variety of the northern all are slender agile sometimes remarkably swift with small heads tapering and unarmed tails and little or means of defence although some of them make such show of ﬁghting that they terrify many an enemy into leaving them alone to this great family belong our various blacksnakes or blue racers which occasionally are more than six feet long and are among the worst robbers of birds nests eating both eggs and young and the mother bird well if it is small and is not quick enough in seeking to escape this is the snake about which stories of 313 314 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https are told we not think there is much truth in them but that the bird is simply reckless in her efforts to drive away the robber and ﬂies too near its darting jaws the blacksnakes are exceedingly swift runners and agile climbers another excellent climber is the slender greensnake which is so near the color of the leaves that it will not be noticed easily it hangs in loops upon the branches of bush waiting quietly some insect to come within reach most of our snakes however spend their time mainly on the ground searching about the grass among the tussocks of swamp or amid dense thickets after frogs toads tadpoles birds mice and especially insects which last form the principal food of the smaller kinds among these probably the most often seen are the striped garter which abound in meadows and about haystacks and old barns where they search holes and corners mice and beetles the warm soft soil of old barnyards is favorite place the laying of their eggs by snakes most of which bury them in such places and leave them to be hatched by the warmth of the sunshine nearly every pond marsh and slow stream abounds also in water which are ugly in disposition well in color and feed mainly on ﬁshes both dead and alive of this kind is the only snake to be found in england except the viper perhaps the most curious of the colubrine snakes is the snake of south africa it is quite small snake not more than two feet long and scarcely thicker in body than man little ﬁnger yet it will swallow pigeons eggs quite easily and if it is very hungry indeed will dispose of hen egg this of course is owing to the way in which the bones of the mouth are made but if you were to watch one of these snakes it was eating an egg you would see very strange thing happen the egg would pass down the throat and few inches you would be able to watch its outline it moved along toward the stomach then quite sudden ly the swelling would disappear the fact is this about thirty of the vertebræ have each long slender spine springing from the lower surface and the tips of these spines pass through the upper part of the throat and project inside it just like row of little teeth in the wrong place just the egg while it is being swallowed comes against these teeth the snake contracts the muscles of its throat the result is that the teeth pierce the egg from end to end and cut it in two then the contents ﬂow onward down the throat while the two halves of the shell nearly always packed one inside the other are shortly afterward spit out of the mouth pythons the pythons are very formidable snakes not because they are they have owing to their immense size and strength when fully grown they may measure much thirty feet in length while their bodies are big round man thigh and even when they are only half long they are still most dangerous creatures they could crush man to death in two or three minutes when python attacks it seizes its victim with its jaws ﬂings its coils one over another around it and then squeezes so hard that in very few minutes the bones ﬂy into splinters and the body is reduced to pulp and large python can swallow sheep or dog without any difﬁculty at all after the snake has swallowed its victim it becomes very drowsy and often sleeps heavily several days another very curious fact with regard to the python is that it actually hatches its eggs by the warmth of its own body it ﬁrst collects the eggs into little pile and then coils itself round them after which it remains perfectly still nearly two months during the whole of that time its bodily heat is much greater than usual and at last the split and out from each comes baby python fortnight or so later they change their skins and then are quite lar ge and strong enough to kill and swallow small birds pythons inhabit nearly all the hotter parts of africa asia and australia and are sometimes known on account of their living much in rocky places boas 315 316 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https boas one kind of which the has long been famous among monsters are much like the pythons but are found only in tropical america and in madagascar and spend the greater part of their lives in the trees they are quite large the pythons and quite formidable it is said indeed that the anaconda which is the largest of all sometimes reaches length of forty feet and there is stuffed skin nine feet long in the natural history museum at south kensington london one can easily imagine what terrible enemy such snake this would be and how helpless even strong man would ﬁnd himself when wrapped in its mighty coils the anaconda is very fond of lying in the water with only just its head raised above the surface and there waiting some animal to swim within reach but most of the boas lie in wait their prey on one of the lower branches of tree in readiness to strike at any small creature that may pass beneath some years ago most singular accident happened in the reptile house at the london zoo two boas one eleven feet long and the other nine feet were living in the same cage and always seemed on the very best of terms one night couple of one each put into the cage and the house was shut up usual next morning however when the keeper opened it the smaller snake had disappeared and there was hole in the cage through which it could possibly have escaped at ﬁrst the keeper was puzzled but soon he noticed that the larger serpent was not coiled up usual but was lying stretched out straight upon the ground then he understood what had happened the big snake had swallowed the smaller one during the night although it was only two feet shorter than itself most likely both snakes had seized the same pigeon at the same moment before very long of course their jaws would have met in the middle now when one of these big snakes has once seized its victim it can not let go because of the way in which its jaws and teeth are made but must go on trying to swallow it so you see when the jaws of the two snakes met in the middle of the pigeon neither could give the bird up to the other because neither could withdraw its teeth and the larger one in fact could not help swallowing the smaller and since that time two or three other accidents of the same character have been prevented only by the constant watchfulness of the keeper poisonous s nakes in all these reptiles the are two in number and are situated in the upper jaw they are very sharp indeed and are almost brittle glass so while they are not in use they are folded back out of harm way upon the roof of the mouth but if by chance they should be broken there are three or four other pairs lying ready use behind them which will quickly grow forward to take their place generally there is tiny hole just under the tip of the fang which opens into narrow passage running right through the center but in some snakes there is only groove outside the fang in either case however the muscles which surround the are arranged in such way that soon the snake strikes its victim drop of poison is squirted down each of the fangs and so into the wound vipers the only poisonous snake found in europe is the viper or adder it is not by any means large snake it is seldom more than twelve or fourteen inches long it has zigzag chain of black markings all the way along its back vipers are generally found on heathy commons and moors and are very fond of lying on patch of bare sandy ground and enjoying the warmth of the sun they never attempt to bite unless they are interfered with but always try to crawl away if alarmed into place of safety their poison is not strong enough to kill man unless he happens to be in very bad state of health at the time when he is bitten but it would be quite sufﬁcient to cause the bitten limb to swell up to double its size and to lead to great deal of suf fering and sickness 317 318 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https far more deadly is the bite of the cobra which is found plentifully in india any one who is bitten by this formidable snake is almost sure to die within two or three hours the upper part of cobra neck is widened out into what is called the hood which can be spread out or folded up at will by the action of the ribs on the upper part of this hood is dark mark which looks almost exactly like pair of spectacles when cobra is about to strike it always raises its head and neck and spreads this hood before darting at its foe in many parts of india cobras are caug ht and tamed by men who are called charmers and who sometimes capture them by playing an odd tune upon sort of wooden pipe this music seems to fascinate the snake which comes out of its hole rears up its head and neck and begins to sway slowly from side to side then still playing the charmer moves his right hand very slowly indeed until it is just behind the snake head when he suddenly grasps the reptile round the neck it is now of course quite helpless and is quickly transferred to his bag many charmers carry cobras about with them which they handle quite freely but in these cases the poison fangs have been carefully extracted so to render the reptiles harmless cobras are very fond of eggs and if they can ﬁnd which opens into house they will often take advantage of it in order to rob the nests but sometimes when they have swallowed several eggs and the hole happens to be small one they can not crawl out again and are found and killed when the house is opened in the morning the p uff dder quite deadly is the of africa which has way of lying almost buried in the sand so that it is not easily seen and if it is disturbed it does not crawl away most poisonous snakes will but remains quite still merely drawing back its head in order to strike when fully grown it is about six feet long and its poison is so deadly that even horse has been known to die within two or three hours of being bitten this snake is called the because it draws in very deep breath when it is annoyed or irritated and puffs out its whole body to nearly double its proper size it then allows the air to escape gradually with kind of sighing noise draws in another deep breath and so on over and over again ipers australia also has some snakes whose bite is very deadly and in general the tropics abound in these dangerous reptiles this is true of america elsewhere but all the american venomous serpents are of kind peculiar to this continent called some of them have rattles at the end of the tail and some lack this appendage but all are much alike certain of the most dreaded such the and the bushmaster belong to the west indies and northern south america but really the worst of the whole bad lot because of its great size and sullen ferocity is the huge diamondback rattlesnake of the southern states it is in some cases longer and heavier than any other known venomous snake and its bite if the wound is well poisoned means almost immediate paralysis and death rattlesnakes several different species of rattlesnakes are scattered over the united states and in some places on the hot dry plains of the southwest and in the arid mountain s of utah and california are numerous enough to be troublesome the cutting away of forests draining of swamps and cultivation of prairies soon destroy these pests in thickly settled regions but where rocky hills occur they linger long time because the breaks and little caves among the ledges offer them secure retreats winter homes where they sleep in 319 320 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https and proper nurseries the young which are not produced from eggs in the coluber family but are born alive the rattles from which these serpents take their name are number of hollow horny structures at the tip of the tail which rattle together with peculiar humming sound when the creature shakes its tail it is sure to when disturbed or angry it thus gives warning to the man who might not have noticed the sluggish creature in his path in time to jump aside not all of the tribe have rattle however and one of the reasons why our water and copperhead are so much dreaded is that they possess rattle and therefore sound f warning all our american venomous snakes are too heavy and slow to climb trees they get their gophers snakes going to place where it is likely to be running about and then patiently waiting until something comes within striking distance chapter xxix amphibians you will remember that the amphibians are distinguished from the true reptiles by having to pass through tadpole stage before they obtain their perfect form good example is the frog which in one kind or another exists in all parts of the earth except the very coldest doubt you have often seen great masses of its spaw n ﬂoating on the surface of ponds early in the spring and you must have wondered how such small creatures frogs could possibly lay such enormous batches of eggs but the fact is that when these eggs are ﬁrst laid they are very tiny each egg is only about big small pin head instead of having shells however they are covered with very elastic skin while at the same time they soak up water so soon they pass into the pond they begin to swell and very soon each egg is big pea tadpole and f rog in the middle of each egg is round black spot which increases in size every day this is the future tadpole and after time the splits and out it tumble s into the water it is an big round head with tiny pair of gills and little wavy tail and nothing else at all but it manages to swim by wagging its tail and it feeds on the tiny scraps of decaying matter which are always ﬂoating about in the water of the pond before long little pair of legs begin to show themselves just at the base of the tail few days later another pair begin to grow in front of them then by slow degrees the tail passes back into the substance of the body and so the gills while lungs are developed and nostrils are opened and by the time that all these chan ges have taken place the tadpole has ceased to be tadpole and has turned into frog it leaves the water now and lives upon land feeding upon small insects which it catches in most curious way its tongu is turned it were the wrong way round the root is just inside the lips while the tip is down the throat besides this the tongue is very elastic and very sticky so the animal catches its victims just the chameleon does ﬂicking out its tongue at them and just touching them with the tip to which they adhere and the tongue is drawn back into the mouth it pokes them down the throat so that frogs not even have to take the trouble of swallowing their dinner if you look at frog hind feet you will notice that the toes are joined together by webbing this allows them to be used in the water well upon dry land it is generally said that frogs swim but if you watch them in the water you will see at once 321 322 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https they not really swim at all but leap along just they leap along the ground and each leap carries them through the water some little distance toads in some ways toads are like frogs but you can tell them at once by their rough dry skins which are covered with warts like glands and they crawl over the groun d instead of leaping frogs they are very common almost everywhere and you may often ﬁnd them hiding under logs or lar ge stones during the daytime toads not lay their eggs in great masses frogs but arrange them in strings about four feet long and an eighth of an inch wide each of these strings consists of two rows of eggs fastened side by side together the tadpoles are very much like those of the frog the chief dif ference being that they are rather smaller and blacker newts all through their lives newts keep their tails instead of losing them when they cease to be tadpoles you can ﬁnd newts in plenty all through spring and summer by ﬁshing with small net in any weedy pond but you will ﬁnd that they are not all alike some have wavy crests running all along their backs others have none and some are brightly colored while others are plain olive green all over often in the woods in certain parts of the united states you will meet with little newts traveling about on the damp old leaves and they are very conspicuous because of their brilliant vermilion color these are young green newts which come out of the water live ashore year or so in the red suit and then go back to the water and green coat newts lay their eggs in very curious manner they not fasten them toget her in great batches like the frog or in long narrow strings like the toad they lay them one by one and the mother newt takes each egg she lays it places it in the middle of the narrow leaf of some water and then twists the leaf neatly round it with her little fore feet so to wrap it up in kind of parcel the tadpole which hatches out of this egg is very much like that of toad or frog but the front legs are the ﬁrst to appea r instead of the hind legs while the tail of course does not pass back into the substan ce of the body newts swim with their tails and very pretty and graceful they look they move through the water when they cease to be tadpoles of course they breathe air just toads and frogs and have to come up to the surface every two or three minutes to obtain it and long they live in the pond they feed upon grubs and worms and tiny water salamanders the curious creatures known salaman ders are related to the newts and begin their lives in just the same way but after they have ceased to be tadpoles they only visit the water two or three weeks in the spring the most celebrated member of this group is the spotted salamander which is found in central and southern europe and also in algeria and syria when fully grown it is about eight inches long and may be known at once by the two rows of large yellow blotches which run down from the back of its head right along its body to the very tip of its tail in days of old it was thought that the salamander had the power of walking through ﬁre without being burnt and it was also supposed if it were attacked to spring upon its enemy bite out piece of his ﬂesh and then spit ﬁre into the wound matter of fact it is almost harmless and may be picked up and handled without the slightest danger but the glands on its skin like those on the toad head and back contain rather poisonous ﬂuid which is squirted out if they are squeezed so that if dog were to pick up 323 324 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https he would be quite sure to drop it again very quickly and would most likely foam at the mouth some little time salamanders are very slow and timid creatures and generally spend the whole of the day concealed in some crevice or in the hollow trunk of tree or perhaps under large stone they feed upon slugs and small insects there are several kinds in north america some of which the hellbender are foot or more in length the giant salamander which is sometim es nearly yard long is found in the rivers of china and japan and spends the whole of its life in the water it feeds chieﬂy upon ﬁshes the xolotl this is one of the most singular of all the amphibians it is found in north america sometimes it develops into its perfect form and sometimes it remains tadpole all its life and yet lays eggs just though it were adult in the lakes of the southern rocky mountains the life of this creature is just like that of any other batrachian that is it is hatched out of the egg tadpole grows ﬁrst one pair of legs and then another loses its gills by degrees and at last appears in form leaving the water and living upon dry land but in the lake which surrounds the city of mexico it never becomes anything more than big tadpole keeps its gills throughout its life and does not leave the water at all the lm the olm or proteus is found only in the under ground lakes of carniola and one or two other parts of central europe it is about foot long when fully grown and has slender body with pair of tiny legs just behind the head and another pair at the base of the tail it is perfectly blind the eyes being hidden under the skin and yet can not bear light if it is kept in captivity it will always hide in the darkest corner that it can ﬁnd and it has been known to live in conﬁnement ﬁve years without once taking any food what the habits of this extraordinary animal are in nature one knows it has never been found except in these under ground lakes in color the olm is pinkish gray with gills and there are from to grooves upon either side of its body fishes chapter xxx ater fishes the lowest class of the vertebrate animals consists of the ﬁshes these are easily distinguished some of the reptiles it is true are very but then they have three chambers in their hearts while the true ﬁshes only have two then ﬁshes never have limbs the place of which is taken by ﬁns and further they breathe water by means of gills there are other differences well but these are quite sufﬁcient to show us that reptiles and ﬁshes can not possibly be mistaken one another 325 326 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https the two however come several very curious creatures which seem to be partly reptiles and partly ﬁshes they have four slender members which hardly seem to be legs though they can not possibly be described ﬁns while they possess not only gills but lungs well the m ud ish one of these is the odd of the african rivers in general appearanc this animal looks something like an eel and it grows to length of about three feet its four long limbs seem to be quite useless to it and it swims by means of its tail along the upper part of which runs narrow ﬁn it is creature of prey feeding upon other ﬁshes and when food is plentiful it just takes one bite out of the lower part of their bodies and more in summer the rivers in which it lives often dry up altogether and the mud at the bottom is baked hard brick by the rays of the sun so soon the water begins to get shallow the animal burrows deep down into the mud curls itself up like fried whiting and falls fast asleep several months just hedgehogs and dormice during the winter in cold countries then when the rainy season comes and the rivers ﬁll up again it comes out from its retreat and swims about before it is from this habit that it gets its name of now we come to the true ﬁshes and perhaps our best plan will be to read about some of the ﬁshes ﬁrst and afterward about some of those which live in the sea sticklebacks let us begin with little ﬁsh which is very common in almost every pond but is nevertheless very curious and very interesting when fully grown the stickleback is about three inches long and you can tell it at once by the sharp spines on its back which it can raise and lower at will it uses these spines in ﬁghting the male sticklebacks at any rate are most quarrelsome little creatures and several weeks during the early part of the summer they are constantly engaged in battle at this season of the year they are really beautiful little ﬁshes the upper parts of their bodies are bright blue and the lower part rich crimson while their heads become pale drab and their eyes bright green and apparently they are very jealous of one another two male sticklebacks in their summer dress never seem able to meet without ﬁghting raising their spines they dash at one another over and over again with the utmost fury each doing his best to swim underneath the other and cut his body open when one of them is beaten he evidently feels quite ashamed of himself he goes and hides in some dark corner where nobody can see him and strange to say soon he loses the battle his beautiful colors begin to fade and in very few hours they disappear altogether about the beginning of june all the male sticklebacks which have not been beaten set to work to build nests these nests are shaped like little tubs with tops or bottoms and they are made of tiny scraps of grass and cut reed and dead leaf neatly woven together soon they are ﬁnished the femal sticklebacks lay their eggs in them then the males get inside and watch over the eggs until they hatch 327 328 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https th american food and game fishes perches another very handsome ﬁsh is the perch which is plentiful in almost every river and lake in the warmer parts of the whole world in color it is rich greenish brown above and yellowish white below with from ﬁve to seven upright dark bands on either side of its body while the upper ﬁns are brown and the lower ones and the tail bright red the front ﬁn on the back of the perch which can be raised or lowered at will is really very formidable weapon it consists of row of very sharp spines projecting some little distance beyond the membrane which joins them together even the pike is afraid of these spines and it is said that although he will seize any other ﬁsh without moment hesitation he will never venture to attack perch early in the month of may the mother perch lays her eggs which she fastens in long bands to the leaves of water their number is very great over having been taken from quite small perch of only about half pound in weight the climbing perch of india notwith standing its name is not true perch but belongs to quite different family it is famous its power of leaving the water and traveling considerable distance over dry land it does this in the hot season if the stream in which it is living dries up and if you were to live in certain parts of india you might perhaps meet quite number of these ﬁshes shufﬂing across the road by means of their lower ﬁns and making their way fast possible toward the nearest river but how they manage to remain out of the water so long well the fact is that ﬁshes can live long time out of the water if their gills are kept moist in some ﬁshes such the herring this is not possible because their gills are made in such way that they become dry almost immediately but the climbing perch has kind of cistern in its head just above the which contains quite quantity of water and while the ﬁsh is traveling over land this water passes down drop by drop to the gills and keeps them constantly damp 329 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https this ﬁsh has been kept in an earthenware vessel without any water at all it has been known to live nearly week the c arp another ﬁsh which will live quite long time out of the water is the carp which has often been conveyed long distances packed in wet moss this ﬁne ﬁsh is native of the old world where it is found both in rivers and lakes but prefers still waters with soft muddy bottom in which it can grovel with its snout in search of food during the winter too it often buries itself completely in the mud and there hibernates remaining perfectly torpid until the return of warmer weather it is not at all an easy ﬁsh to catch it is so wary that it will refuse to touch any bait in which it thinks that hook may be concealed and if the stream in which it is living is dragged with net it just burrows down into the mud at the bottom and allows the net to pass over it owing to this crafty and cunning nature the carp has often been called the water fox the carp is very handsome ﬁsh being olive brown above with tinge of gold while the lower parts are yellowish white it sometimes weighs much pounds and has been known to lay more than eggs it is domesticated in many parts of north america and other countries the b arbel found in many old world rivers the barbel may be known at once by the four long ﬂeshy organs which hang down from the nose and the corners of the mouth these organs are called barbules and may possibly be of some help to the ﬁsh when it is grubbing in the soft mud in search of the small creatures upon which it feeds it spends hours in doing this and hungry barbel is sometimes so much occupied in its task that swimmer has dived down to the bottom of the river and caught it with his hands from this curious way of feeding and its great greediness the barbel has sometimes been called the pig in color this ﬁsh is greenish brown above yellowish green on the sides of the body and white underneath when fully grown it weighs from ten to twelve pounds the r oach this is one of the prettiest of the european ﬁshes which is found in many lakes and streams the upper part of the head and back are grayish green with kind of blue gloss which gradually becomes paler on the sides till it passes into the silvery white of the lower surface the ﬁns and the tail are bright red the roach does not grow to very great size it seldom weighs more than two pounds it lives in large shoals and in clear water several hundred may often be seen swimming about together the p ike one of the largest and quite the ﬁerces t of the british ﬁshes is the pike which is found both in lakes and rivers in america we have pike proper but in some of the great western lakes very large relative of similar habits known the maskinonge and our pickerels are only small pikes wonderful tales are told of the ferocity of the pike he does not seem to know what fear is and his muscular power is so great and the rows of teeth with which his jaws are furnished are so sharp and strong that he is really most formidable foe all other ﬁshes are afraid of him while he gobbles up water of all kinds and water and frogs and even worms and insects and matter how much food he eats he never seems to be satisﬁed 330 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https the pike is hungry he generally hides under an overhanging bank or among weeds and there waits his victims to pass by the young pike is generally known the jack and when only ﬁve inches long has been known to catch and devour gudgeon almost big itself with such voracious appetite it is not surprising that the ﬁsh grows very fast and long time it increases in weight at the rate of about four pounds in every year how long it continues to grow nobody quite knows but pike of or forty pounds have often been taken and there have been records of examples even lar ger still in color the pike is olive brown marked with green and yellow trout perhaps the greatest favorite of all anglers is the trout which in one or more of its various species is to be caught in almost every swift stream and highland lake throughout the temperate zone except where the race has been destroyed by too persistent ﬁshing this happens everywhere near civilization unless protective laws regulate the times and places where ﬁshing may be done similar laws are required to save many other kinds of ﬁshes from quick destruction at the hands of the thoughtless and selﬁsh and they should be honestly obeyed and supported in spite of their occasionally interfering with amusement trout are graceful in form and richly colored most of them having arrangements of bright spots and gaily tinted ﬁns the common trouts of europe and the eastern half of the united states and canada are much alike but in the rocky and other mountains of the western shore of our continent others quite different are scattered from the plains to the paciﬁc one of the most interesting and beautiful of these the has been brought into the east and has made itself at home in many lakes and rivers of the northern states and canada the trout is an extremely active ﬁsh and when it is hooked it tries its very hardest to break away dashing to and fro leaping twisting and ﬁghting and often giving the angler great deal of trouble before he can bring it in in small streams it seldom grows to any great size but in some of the scottish lochs and lakes of maine trout weighing ﬁfteen or even twenty pounds are often taken it is sometimes considered however that these belong to dif ferent species the s almon more famous even than the trout is the salmon the largest and ﬁnest of all our water ﬁshes which often reaches weight of or ﬁfty pounds and sometimes grows to still greater size it is hardly correct however to speak of it ﬁsh although salmon are nearly always caught in rivers they spend considerable part of their lives in the sea salmon are of two atlantic and the paciﬁc species and the of each is very curious one during the winter the parent ﬁshes of the atlantic salmon which used to be exceedingly numerous in all our northern rivers emptying into the atlantic and still haunt the rivers of northeastern canada and of scotland make their way far up clear and gravelly river they possibly can till they ﬁnd suitable place in which to lay their eggs the mother then scoops hole at the bottom of the stream in which she deposits her eggs in batches carefully covering up each batch she does so at this time both parents are in very poor condition and the males are known to anglers kelts time they remain in the river feeding ravenously then in march or april they travel down the river and pass into the sea where they stay three or four months after which they ascend the river again before meanwhile the eggs remain buried in the gravel about four months at the end of that time the little ﬁshes hatch out and immediately hide themselves about fortnight under rock or large stone you would never know what they were if you were to see 331 332 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https they look much more like tadpoles than ﬁshes and each has little bag of nourishment underneath its body on which it lives when this is exhausted they leave their retreat and feed upon small insects growing very rapidly until in about month time they are four inches long they are now called parr and have row of dark stripes upon their sides and in this condition they remain at least year their color then changes the stripes disappearing and the whole body becoming covered with bright silvery scales the little ﬁshes are now known smolts and like their parents they make their way down the river and pass into the sea there they remain until the autumn when they ascend the river again by this time they have grown considerably weighing perhaps ﬁve or six pounds and are called grilse and it is not until they have visited the sea again in the following year that they are termed salmon when salmon are ascending river and come to waterfall they climb it by leaping into the air and so springing into the stream above the fall trying over and over again until they succeed when the fall is too high to be climbed in this way the owners of the river often make kind of water staircase by the side of it so that the ﬁshes can leap up one stair at time this is called north p acific s almon now this description would not at all ﬁt the case of the salmon which live in the north paciﬁc and ascend the rivers of california british columbia and alaska and of siberia and japan on the other side of the ocean these are the salmon which supply the whole country and many other countries with their pink ﬂesh boiled and sealed in cans so that it may be sent long distances and kept many months without spoiling every spring and summer at different times according to the locality and the are ﬁve kinds of importance caught the numbers of them enter the mouths of the rivers and begin to make their way in their effort to reach the shallow head waters of each river and of every one of its tributaries it is at this time that they are caught by spearing netting and vario us contrivances but laws prevent any general obstruction which would altogether stop the advance of the host so that while tens of thousands are taken great numbers escape and pass on it is necessary they should in order to lay eggs and so keep up the race this takes place far up at the heads of the streams in the foothills of the mountains and having deposited the spawn late in summer the spent ﬁsh begin to drift down stream again but all this time they have been eating nothing they are worn with the long struggle against the rapids often wounded by sharp rocks and are good nothing to catch or eat in fact so fagged out and weak are they that all of them die before any reach the mouth of the river it is strange fact that of all the vast host of salmon which each summer climb the rivers not single one gets back to the sea year later however the young hatched from the eggs which were left behind them at the heads of the streams swim down the rivers and enter the ocean there they remain probably not very far from land two or three years feeding and growing until they are of full size and strength and each season class of them having reached the right age and condition to spawn force their way up to the to leave their eggs and then die did their parents before them eels the only other ﬁshes which we can notice are the eels which look more like snakes than ﬁshes they have long slender bodies with pair of tiny ﬁns just behind the head long one running along the back and tail like crest and another equally long under the body and they are clothed with smooth slimy skin instead of with scales these curious creatures live in ponds and even in ditches well in rivers and are very plentiful in all parts of the northern hemisphere during the daytime although they will sometimes bask at the surface in the warm sunshine they generally lie buried in the 333 334 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https at the bottom of the water coming out soon after sunset to feed and when the weather is damp so that their gills are kept moist they wriggle through the herbage they will often leave the water and travel some little distance overland they frequently this when they are traveling toward the sea it is strange fact that although they are ﬁshes eels both begin and end their lives in the sea in the ﬁrst place the eggs are laid in the quite close to the mout h of river when the little elvers the young eels are called hatch out they make their way up the river in immense shoals in the english river severn instance sever al tons of elvers are often caught in single day and about thirty million elvers go to the ton after being pressed into cakes and fried these little creatures are used food but they are so rich that one can not eat very many at once when they have traveled far enough up the river most of the elvers which have escaped capture make their way to different streams and pools and ditches and there remain until their growth is completed they then begin to journey back to the sea and when they reach it they lay eggs in their turn after this apparently they die in the rivers of south america most wonderful eel is found which has the power of killing its victims by means of an elect ric shock wherefore it is called the electric eel the electricity is produced and stored up in two large organs inside the body but how it is dischar ged nobody knows if the ﬁsh is touched it merely gives slight shudder but the shock is so severe that quite large ﬁsh can be killed by it while man arm would be numbed moment right up to the shoulder lampreys the lamprey which is found plentifully in many northern rivers is very much like an eel in appearance but it has side ﬁns and instead of possessing jaws it has round mouth used sucking and resembling that of leech and on either side of its neck it has row of seven round holes through which water passes to the gans lampreys seem to spend the greater part of their lives in the sea but always come up the rivers to spawn they lay their eggs in hollow in the bed of the stream which they make by dragging away stone after stone till the hole is sufﬁciently deep very often large number of lampreys combine this purpose and make quite big hole in which they all lay their eggs together the length of the lamprey is generally from ﬁfteen to eighteen inches and its color is olive brown chapter xxxi fishes we now come to the ﬁshes of the sea and at the head of these we may place the sharks these savage and voracious creatures are found in all oceans the larger ones wandering very widely while the smaller ones are restricted to limited parts of the sea among the latter are the various small sharks called dogﬁsh from eighteen inches to six feet long found on both sides of the north atlantic though small and harmless to man the dogﬁsh really is shark and its size is very formidable being able easily to ﬁght and kill ﬁshes quite lar ge itself it is called the dogﬁsh because it follows shoals of ﬁsh in the water just wild dog will follow the animals on which it preys upon dry land 335 336 337 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https you are staying at the seaside you may sometimes ﬁnd the dead body of dogﬁsh lying on the beach where it has been ﬂung by very high wave and you will notice how coarse and rough its skin is this skin is often used covering the handles of swords it gives such an excellent grip and also putting on the sides of boxes instead of sandpaper but even if you not ﬁnd the dogﬁsh itself lying on the beach you may often ﬁnd its eggs which are very curious little objects they are something like oblong horny purses of color with long twisted appendage at each corner very much like the tendrils of vine by means of these the egg is anchored down to the weeds at the bottom of the sea and they hold so ﬁrmly that they are hardly ever torn away except during violent storm at each end of this singular egg is narrow slit through which water can pass to the gills of the little ﬁsh which is lying inside it and one end of the egg is made in such manner that when the ﬁsh is ready to hatch it can easily push its way out the b lue s hark much larger and more dangerous ﬁsh which often visits northern seas is the blue shark which sometimes grows to length of ﬁfteen or sixteen feet it does not often attack human beings however but is very destructive in our ﬁsheries snatching away ﬁshes which have been hooked and even swimming along the outside of the nets they are being drawn in and biting great holes through them in order to get at the pilchards or herrings within so the ﬁshermen always kill blue shark if they have the chance of doing so and sometimes destroy eight or ten in single day but it is not very easily caught if it is hooked it will often bite the line asunder and if it can not this will roll round and round in the water coiling the line round its body when it will snap with sudden jerk even when it is caught the blue shark is not killed without much difﬁculty it thrashes its great powerful tail about in such manner that it can not be approached without danger so the ﬁrst thing that the ﬁshermen always try to when it is captured is to chop of f its tail with an ax the color of this shark is slaty blue above and white beneath the w hite s hark even larger and more dangerous still the great white shark or rondeleti shark is one of the most formidable creatures that roam the seas it often grows to length of or even forty feet and weighs ten or twelve tons while one snap of its huge jaws will shear of f man legs or cut his body in two this enormous ﬁsh is found in all the warmer parts of the sea and in general sharks and especially the lar ge ones belong to the tropical rather than to the colder seas the h ammerhead huge and creature of curious appearance this ﬁsh has its head formed just like that of hammer the eyes being placed at each end of the projecting lobes it grows to length of ﬁfteen or sixteen feet and is very ﬁerce and savage attacking human beings without the least hesitation it is nearly always found in the tropical seas but has been several times captured of f the coasts of new england the t hresher growing to length of ten or twelve feet the thresher is remarkable shark it is common in the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean it feeds chieﬂy upon herrings darting into the midst of shoal and snapping them up in hundreds what it is specially famous however is its habit of attacking whales this purpose several threshers will unite together leap up into the air and strike tremendous blows with their long tails upon the whale body they fall back into the sea this 338 339 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https terriﬁes the whale and he dives under water in order to escape from his tormentors knowing that he must very soon rise again however they wait his reappearance and then attack him again in the same way this happens again and again until he is quite worn out by his exertions and by the impossibility of remaining long enough at the surface to breathe properly then if any swordﬁshes happen to be in the neighborhood they come and attack him too driving their long swords deep into his body before long the whale is dead and both threshers and swordﬁshes are tearing great strips of ﬂesh from the carcass and greedily devouring them fishes next to the sharks come the which have the upper jaw drawn out into the form of long narrow beak set on either side with row of large pointed teeth so it really looks very much indeed like saw the ﬁsh uses this curious weapon by dashing into the midst of shoal of smaller ﬁshes and striking them right and left with its saw in this way it is sure to disable good many which it then swallows leisurely one after the other are found in all the warmer seas and sometimes grow to length of ﬁfteen or twenty feet rays the rays have broad ﬂattened bodies and very long and slender tails in consequence of this structure they can not swim by means of their tails nearly all other ﬁshes but travel slowly through the water by waving their side ﬁns after the manner of soles and ﬂounders one of the best known of these ﬁshes is the skate which when fully grown sometimes measures much six feet in length from the snout to the tip of the tail and ﬁve feet in width of body it can not swim fast enough to overtake other ﬁshes it preys chieﬂy upon crabs lobsters and aring mollusks which it ﬁnds on the bottom and is able easily to crunch up shells and all the eggs of this ﬁsh may be found in great numbers on the they are very much like those of the dogﬁsh but are nearly black in color and instead of long twisted tendril at each corner they only have blunt projection about an inch long they remind one in fact of and consequently the ﬁshermen often call them barrows in color the skate is grayish brown above and grayish white beneath another very curious ray is the torpedo which is an electric ﬁsh having kind of electric battery inside its body from which very powerful shock can be dischar ged at will this battery in appearance is something like honeycomb consisting of number of columns which run from the skin of the back to that of the lower surface of the body each of these columns is divided into number of cells or chambers by thin walls of membrane and each cell contains liquid which seems to consist chieﬂy of salt and water the electricity produced and stored up in these organs seems to be dischar ged along four great nerves which run from the battery up to the brain the shock is sufﬁciently strong to kill duck and not only has an electric bell been rung by it but an electric spark has been actually obtained and when ﬁve persons held one another hands and the person at each end laid his ﬁnger upon the torpedo every one of the ﬁve persons felt the shock even more formidable though in quite different way is the at the base of its long tail this ﬁsh has bony spine set with sharp teeth like saw and its favorite mode of attack is to coil this tail round the body of its victim and then to drive the spine into his ﬂesh working it back ward and forward in such manner to cause very serious wound always followed by severe inﬂammation 340 341 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of the rays in the warmer seas grow to very great size indeed ray measuring over eighteen feet in length has more than once been captured they are dangerous creatures to meddle with ﬁsh of this size is quite strong enough to overturn boat while if man were once seized by one of them he would have very little chance of escape these huge creatures are generally known the s turgeon this ﬁsh belongs to quite different group which may be distinguished by two points in the ﬁrst place its skeleton is made not of bone but of gristle and in the second place ﬁve rows of bony plates run along the back and sides of the body forming kind of natural armor the sturgeon is often eight or nine feet long and weighs three or four hundred pounds it spends most of its life in the sea but ascends the rivers in order to spawn like the salmon it is not so common formerly in american waters although sturgeon are taken in nearly all our larger rivers from time to time but in some parts of europe and especially in russia it is very plentiful caviare is made from the sturgeon roe the membranes which separate the eggs from one another are all removed and the eggs are then salted and pressed into small barrels being afterward eaten kind of preserve the best isinglass is made from the sturgeon which has so much gelatine in it that if small quantity is dissolved in hundred times much boiling water it will form stif f jelly when it is cold the sturgeon ﬂesh is very good to eat it is not only but is so ﬁrm and solid that it is almost like beef in england the sturgeon is known royal ﬁsh because in days of old when one of these ﬁsh was caught in an english river it was always kept the table of the king and even now if sturgeon is captured in that part of the thames which is under the control of the lord mayor of london it belongs by right to the crown the b eaked c hæt odon great many ﬁshes are very odd to look at and this is one of the oddest imagine ﬁsh with an almost circular ﬂattened body with ﬁve brown bands edged with white running round it huge round eyes enormous triangular ﬁns both above and below the body broad tail which looks if it were tied in by piece of ribbon at the base and mouth drawn out into long slender beak and this ﬁsh has habit which is even odder still when it sees an insect sitting on leaf which overhangs the margin of the sea it takes careful aim squirts drop of water at it from out of its long beak and nearly always succeeds in knocking it into the water below this ﬁsh lives in the indian and polynesian seas and is sometimes kept pet by the japanese who amuse themselves by fastening ﬂy to the end of piece of stick and holding it over the bowl in which the ﬁsh is living in order to see it knocked off its perch by pellet of water the c od throughout the northern seas the cod is found and in some parts it is taken in immense numbers the largest and ﬁnest of all which sometimes weigh more than one hundred pounds come from the banks or shallows in the sea off the shores of newfoundland but very ﬁne ones have been taken elsewhere and extensive are maintained in the north paciﬁc near alaska cod are mostly captured by means of long lines each about forty fathoms in length to which number of smaller lines are fastened at intervals the hooks are placed on the side lines and are generally baited with whelks and then the long lines or trawls the ﬁshermen call them are anchored in shallow parts of the sea where codﬁshes halibut 342 343 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https the like abound each boat carries about eight miles of these lines with nearly ﬁve thousand hooks so that the work of baiting lowering and raising them is very heavy indeed the ﬁshing takes place in the winter and the boats are generally out in all weathers several months at time one would think that with so many boats engaged in each with so many miles of line nearly all the cod in the sea would soon be caught but to offset this single cod in single year will often lay eight or nine million eggs so that notwithstanding the immense number of these ﬁshes which are taken they still seem plentiful ever flatfish the ﬂatﬁshes such the sole the plaice the ﬂounder and the dab form an interesting group although we call them ﬂat we ought really to call them thin because what we always consider the back of sole is really one of its sides and what seems to be the lower surface is the other side the explanation is this when these ﬁshes are quite small they swim upright in the water just other ﬁshes and drive themselves along by means of their tails but when they are about month old strong desire comes over them to go and lie down on the mud at the bottom of the sea and then three remarkable things happen first their color changes up till now both sides of their bodies have been nearly white but if white ﬁsh were to lie down on mud of course it would very easily be seen and most likely would very soon be devoured by one of its many enemies so soon the little ﬁsh lies down at the bottom of the water its upper surface begins to grow darker and before very long it exactly resembles the hue of the surrounding mud or if the ﬁsh should lie upon sand the plaice does then its upper surface becomes colored like the sand so long it keeps still its enemies may pass quite close to it without noticing it the next thing that happens is that the little ﬁsh changes its way of swimming hitherto it has driven itself through the water by means of its tail now it uses what were formerly its upper and lower ﬁns but have now been turned into side ﬁns and by very graceful waving movement of these ﬁns it winds its way it were through the water but the third change is the strangest of the three one of the eyes would now seem to be useless since it is on the lower surface of the head the ﬁsh lies on the and would be completely buried in the mud but soon the ﬁsh goes and lies down at the bottom of the sea this eye actually begins to travel along the lower surface of the head till at last it works its way round and settles down by the side of the other if you look at the ﬂounders the next time you pass by you will observe that both eyes are placed quite close together above the same corner of the mouth that is because the lower eye traveled round the head till it found by the side of the other in habits all these ﬁshes are very much alike they are found in almost all seas except those of the polar regions and in most parts of the world are exceedingly plentiful and everywhere form cheap and excellent food the s wordfish very creature is this it abounds in the atlantic and also in the mediterranean its chase affords one of the ﬁnest summer sports to be enjoyed along the south coast of new england where it is taken by spearing from swift sailboats in this ﬁsh the upper jaw which has hardly any teeth in it is drawn out into long slender pointed beak with this sword the ﬁsh impales its victims which are often of considerable size but how it gets them off its beak again in order to eat them nobody seems to know this ﬁsh sometimes drives its way through the water with such tremendous force that it has been known to pierce the planking of boat with its sword which it had to snap 344 345 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of f in order to release itself in the natural history museum at south kensington london there is part of beam taken from the hull of ship into which one of these ﬁshes had driven its sword to depth of inches mackerel one of the best known of all the ﬁshes is the mackerel this ﬁsh lives in enormous shoals which are always traveling from place to place and visit the same parts of our coasts at about the same season in every year sometimes they are caught in most extraordinary numbers so that they can be purchased at very small prices in some cases indeed the catch has been so heavy that it has been found quite impossible to draw in the nets which had to be allowed to sink to the bottom with the ﬁshes still in them these nets are generally made with rather large meshes not quite wide enough to allow the ﬁshes to swim through when the mackerel are caught they try to force their way through the meshes but ﬁnd that they can not so they then attempt to back out in doing this however the thin twine of which the net is made is almost sure to become entangled with their so that they are held prisoners until the net is lifted from the water when fully grown the mackerel is about sixteen inches long and weighs perhaps two pounds sucking ishes of the or remoras there are about dozen different kinds distinguished by the odd sucker disk on the upper part of the head by means of which they can attach themselves ﬁrmly to any object to which they wish to cling they often fasten themselves in this manner to the hulls of ships and also to the bodies of sharks and the shells of turtles and so are carried long distances without any exertion of their own so ﬁrmly these odd little ﬁshes cling that it is most difﬁcult to remove them without injuring them and the sharks and turtles have means of forcing them to loose their hold it is very odd fact that the coloring of the is just the opposite of that which we ﬁnd in almost all other ﬁshes instead of the upper surface being dark it is light and instead of the lower surface being light it is dark but when one of these ﬁshes is clinging to shark it is the lower surface which is seen not the upper one that is pressed against the body of the shark and in order to prevent its enemies from seeing and eating it the lower parts of its body are colored just like the skin of the shark weevers strange little ﬁshes are the weevers two kinds of which are found on the coast of europe both are highly poisonous prick from the spines of the upper ﬁn or the being almost serious the sting of scorpion the poison lies in deep double groove on each spine and the ﬁshes have habit of burying themselves in the sand at the bottom of shallow water with only just the sharp spines projecting they are rather apt to be trodden upon by bathers accordingly when ﬁsherman catches weever he always cuts off its back ﬁn and the spines of its at once

satisﬁed but at the same time it is so slow in its movements that if it were to try to chase its victims it would never get anything to eat it seems to know perfectly well however that ﬁshes are very inquisitive creatures and that they are always greatly attracted by any object that glitters so when it feels hungry it lies down at the bottom of the sea stirs the mud gently up with its side ﬁns so to conceal itself from view and dangles the glittering spine up and down in front of its open mouth before very long some passing ﬁsh is sure to come swimming up to see what this strange object can possibly be and then the angler just gives one snap with its great jaws and that ﬁsh is seen more just to show you how successful it is in its ﬁshing we may tell you that from the body of single angler less than herrings have been taken while another had swallowed ﬂounders and there is another kind of angler which lives down at the bottom of the deep sea where it is always perfectly dark there of course glittering spine would be useless the other ﬁshes would not be able to see it so this angler has spine which shines at the tip like ﬁreﬂy so that it can be seen from considerable distance the ﬁsh dangles it up and down gurnards these too are remarkable ﬁshes having square heads which look ever so much too big their bodies and the ﬁrst three rays of their pectoral or breast ﬁns made like ﬁngers these are used like ﬁngers too they serve organs of touch while the ﬁsh also walks with them along the sand at the bottom of the sea at least forty different kinds of gurnards have been discovered but nearly all dwell along foreign coasts the handsomest of these perhaps is the red gurnard which grows to length of twelve or fourteen inches and is bright red above and silvery white below flying f ishes though objects of never interest to every one who journeys through the warmer seas ﬂying ﬁshes not really ﬂy they merely skim long distances through the air just the ﬂying squirrel and the ﬂying dragon but instead of having broad membrane to buoy them up they are supported in the air by the pectoral or breast ﬁns which are very large these ﬁns not beat the air like the wings of bird they merely support the body and the power of the ﬂight is due to stroke of the tail just the ﬁsh leaves the water the reason why these ﬁshes take their long leaps through the air appears to be that they are much persecuted by other ﬁshes bigger and stronger than themselves and that they know quite well that they will be overtaken if they remain in the water they not usually rise to height of more than few feet above the surface and the greatest distance to which they can travel without falling back into the water seems to be about two hundred yards whether they can alter the direction of their course while they are in the air is uncertain some observers say that they can while others declare that they can not but it is possible that they may sometimes so by just touching the crest of wave with their tails flying ﬁshes are found in all the warme r parts of the sea and are very common in the mediterranean and the west indies the h erring like the mackerel the herring is one of those ﬁshes which live in vast shoals and are of great value cheap and nutritio us food these shoals consist of millions upon 347 348 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of ﬁshes and when they are swimming near the surface of the sea their presence can generally be detected by the numbers of which follow them and devour them in countless thousands whales too often follow the shoal days together and sharks and many other big ﬁshes the same yet nothing seems to lessen their numbers these shoals generally appear in the same parts of the sea year after year at the same season but sometimes the herring will desert their favorite haunts without any apparent cause during spring and early summer they remain in deep water but in june and july they come in nearer the coast in order to spawn gobies there are still several very curious and interesting ﬁshes about which we should like to tell you and among these are the gobies many different kinds of these odd little creatures are found in different parts of the world other than north america but perhaps the best known of all is the black goby which is very common off british coasts you can often catch it by ﬁshing with small net in the pools which are left among the rocks the tide goes out and if you look into these pools from above you may often see it clinging to the rocks round the margin it does this by means of the ﬁns on the lower part of its body which are made in such manner that when they are placed side by side together they form kind of sucker and if you keep the ﬁsh in an aquarium it has an odd way of suddenly darting at the side of the tank clinging to it with its ﬁns and staring at you through the glass some of the gobies make nests in which to bring up their little ones just the sticklebacks one of them the spotted goby which is found rather commonly in the lower reaches of the thames nearly always takes one of the shells of cockle this purpose first it turns the shell upside down then it scoops out the sand from beneath it and smears the surface of the hollow with slime from its own body and then it piles loose sand over the shell so to keep it in position lastly it makes little tunnel by which to enter the nest from outside this work is always performed by the male when the nest is quite ﬁnished the female comes and lays her eggs in it after which the male keeps guard over them until they hatch about eight or nine days later mud kippers more curious still are these ﬁshes which are found on the coasts of the tropical seas and often make their way some little distance up the estuaries of rivers they have singular eyes which are set on the upper surface of the head and can be poked out to some little distance and drawn back again in the oddest way and besides that these eyes have eyelids then the lower ﬁns are made just like those of the gobies but with an even greater power of clinging so that the ﬁsh can climb by means of them often these queer little creatures leave the sea altogether and skip about on the muddy shore or even climb up the trunks of the trees which overhang the water sometimes they will rest quite long time on the spreading roots snapping at the ﬂies and other small insects which come within reach they not look like ﬁshes at all they so they look much more like rather big tadpoles and if they are suddenly startled they go hopping and skipping back into the water not diving at once but leaping along over the surface very much ﬂat stone does when thrown sideways from the hand some of these ﬁshes were kept some time at the london zoo and when they were out of the water they had an odd way of lying at full length and raising their heads and the front part of their bodies by means of their lower ﬁns so that they reminded one very much of man with his elbows resting upon the table ishes the has its mouth drawn out into very long snout so that it forms kind of tube the body is sixteen or eighteen inches long yet scarcely stouter than an ordinary and the only ﬁn besides small one on the back is tiny one at the very tip of the tail besides this the whole head and body are covered with bony plates which 349 350 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https kind of coat of mail and the ﬁsh is even odder in habits than in appearance when the eggs are laid they are put into pouch in the lower part of the body of the male and are kept there until they hatch it is even said that after the little ones are hatched and are able to swim about in the water they will return into the pouch of the parent in moments of danger just young kangaroos will into that of their mother but this does not seem to have been proved are not uncommon on our coasts and you may often ﬁnd them in the pools among the rocks when the tide is out they swim half erect in the water and if you watch them carefully you may see them poking their long mouths in among the seaweeds in search of food standing on their heads among the in which position they are hard to see or blowing furrows in the sand at the bottom of the pool in order to turn out any small creatures which may be lying hidden in it the s ea orse closely related to the is the which reminds one of the knight in set of chessmen it has long and slender tail which is prehensile like that of spider monkey and by means of this organ the ﬁsh anchors itself ﬁrmly down to the stems of seaweeds or to any small object which may be ﬂoating on the surface of the water the eyes of this ﬁsh can be moved independently of each other like those of chameleon and if you keep one of these creatures in bowl of and watch it few minutes you will ﬁnd it hard to believe that it is not purposely making faces at you the male like the male has pouch underneath his body in which the eggs are placed soon they are laid and are kept until they hatch the swims by means of single ﬁn on its back which acts on the water very much like the screw of steamboat just at the back of its head are two more ﬁns and when these are thrown forward they look like the ears of horse increasing the queer resemblance of its long head to that of pony are found in most of the warmer seas and in summer ﬂoat north with the gulf stream so that they are frequently seen near new england congers just there are eels which live in the fresh water so there are eels which live in the sea these are known congers and very often they grow to great size conger eight feet long is by means uncommon and ﬁsh of this length will weigh at least one hundred pounds congers generally live in rather shallo w water off rocky coast where there are plenty of nooks and crevices in which they can hide during the daytime it is rather curious to ﬁnd that those which live in muddy places are nearly always dark brown or black in color while those which lie upon sand are and sometimes almost white these eels are generally caught by means of long lines which are set at interval s with short snoods just like those which are used in catching cod the hooks are generally baited with pilchards or else with pieces of the long arms of cuttles when the congers are lifted on board the scene is usually an exciting one they are very powerful and active and go twisting and writhing about in the most extraordinary manner slapping vigorously on all sides with their long tails these tails too to some extent are prehensile and sometimes the ﬁshes will seize the gunwale of the boat and then with sudden effort pull themselves over the side and drop back into the water soon they are lifted on board the ﬁshermen always try to stun them by heavy blow on the lower side of the body after which of course they can be easily killed congers feed rule upon mollusks which we wrongly call devouring them shells and all they will also eat small ﬁshes however and sometimes they are 351 352 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https inside the body of one of these ﬁshes young conger was found that was three feet in length amphioxus or l ancelet in this we see creature so curiously formed that good many naturalists have doubted whether it ought to be ranked among the ﬁshes at all in appearance it is much more like slug and it has skull and brain and bones and eyes and gills and heart it has ﬁn running along its back however and although it has spine it possesses spinal cord so it is considered the very lowest of all the ﬁshes and kind of link between the animals with bones and those without them this strange little creature is about two inches and half long when fully grown and is so transparent that one can almost see through its body it is very active and can wriggle and twist about in the water or on the mud with considerable speed it spends most of its life concealed under large stones or lying almost buried in the muddy sand at the bottom of the sea and it seems to feed upon those minute atoms of decaying animal and vegetable matter which are always ﬂoating about in countless millions in the waters of the sea invertebrates chapter xxxii insects we now come to the second of the two great divisions of the animal kingdom namely the invertebrates which includes all those creatures which have bones this division in its turn consists of good many classes just that of the vertebrates does and among these is that of the insects the peculiarity of which is that they must pass through three stages of development before they reach their perfect form namely ﬁrst the egg then the grub or caterpillar and then the chrysalis or pupa you can easily tell an insect when you see it by remembering one or two simple rules in the ﬁrst place its body is always divided into three principal parts which are known the head the thorax or chest and the hind body in the second place it always has six legs spiders have eight legs centipedes and millepedes have many legs but an insect never has more nor less than six and each of these limbs is made up of thigh lower leg and foot while the foot itself has from two to ﬁve little joints the last of which usually has pair of tiny claws at the tip besides these there are several other ways in which insects differ from the rest of the vertebrates we need only tell you about one of them however and that is that in some form or other they always have four wings sometimes it is true you can not see these wings that is because they are not developed and can not be used ﬂying but still they are there and by means of the microscope it is almost always easy to detect them these wings however take all sorts of forms the wings of butterﬂy example are very different from those of beetle or bee and because of these differences in the wings insects are divisible into several smaller groups which we call orders beetles 353 354 355 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https comes the order of the beetles these are called coleoptera or insects because their front wings instead of being formed ﬂight are turned into horny or leathery sheaths or elytra which cover up and protect the lower pair while not in use at least different kinds of beetles have already been discovered in various parts of the world of which america possesses tens of thousands and probably quite many more remain to be distinguished of these we can only mention few of the most interesting the are so called because they are such ﬁerce and voracious insects spending most of their time in chasing and devouring other insects the commonest of them is about half an inch long and is bright green above and coppery below you may often see it darting about in the hot sunshine and if you try to catch it you will generally ﬁnd that it ﬂies away quickly bluebottle are common in gardens one often seen is about an inch long and is deep black in color with narrow band of violet running round the outer edge of its this too is creature of prey it can not hurt you but if you pick it up it will make your ﬁngers smell very nasty it can pour out from its mouth drop or two of liquid which has horrible odor then there are good many beetles which live in streams and ponds and are called water in consequence they can swim and dive very well and are also able to ﬂy almost every night they go long journeys through the air and when they want to go back into the pond they hover above it moment fold their wings and drop into the water with splash only sometimes they ﬂy over the roof of greenhouse and mistake that pond and then you can imagine the result the cocktails are beetles with short and very long slender bodies which they carry turned up at the rear end some of them are quite large like the ugly black but many are very small indeed most of the ﬂies which get into one eyes on warm sunny days in england are really tiny cocktail beetles and the reason why they make one eyes smart so dreadfully is that they pour out little drop of an smelling liquid from their mouths just like the purple scavengers the are so called because they bury dead animals have you ever wondered why we so seldom ﬁnd dead mouse or dead bird although these creatures must die in thousands every day one reason is that soon they are dead couple of scavengers are almost sure to come and bury them they are big black beetles sometimes with two broad yellow stripes across their and they dig by means of their heads scooping out the earth from under the carcass till it has sunk well below the surface of the ground then they lay their eggs in it come up to the surface shovel back the earth till the dead body is quite covered over and then ﬂy away and when the eggs hatch the little grubs which come out from them feed upon the carcass among the largest beetles are those called because the jaws of the male look very much like the horns of stag those of the female are much smaller but are so sharp and strong that they can really give rather severe bite these occur in various parts of the world and are fond of ﬂying slowly about on warm summer evening generally about twenty or thirty feet from the ground the cockchafer is common everywhere in spring and if you shake young tree or three or four of the great clumsy insects will very likely come tumbling down they are rather more than an inch long very stoutly and heavily built and are chestnut brown in color while their bodies are drawn out into kind of point behind the grubs of these beetles live under ground and great deal of mischief in ﬁelds and gardens they feed upon the roots of the plants and very soon kill them too are very common everywhere you may often see them ﬂying round and round in great circles on warm summer evenings making loud humming noise they so they often blunder in at open windows attracted by the lampl ight and 356 357 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https are afraid of them but they can harm if you catch one you will ﬁnd that it is nearly black you will also see that its front legs are broad and strong and that they are set with row of stout horny teeth with these legs the beetle digs using them with such address that in the course of an hour or two it will sink hole in the ground ten or twelve inches deep in order to lay its eggs at the bottom the famous scarabæus of egypt which in days of old some of the people of that country used to revere because they thought it symbol of immortality is really kind of dor skipjacks and g lowworms skipjacks too are beetles you may know them by their long narrow glossy bodies and by the fact that the head is hidden under the thorax so that you can hardly see it from above one very odd thing about them is that they are constantly losing their footing and rolling over on their backs and their bodies are so shiny and their legs are so short that when they so they can not get up again in the ordinary manner but after lying still moment they arch themselves into the form of bow resting only upon their heads and the very tips of their tails and suddenly spring into the air making an odd clicking noise they so and they fall they turn half round and so alight upon their feet this reason they are often known these insects are the parents of the wireworms which often such mischief in our ﬁelds and gardens living under ground three or even four years and feeding upon the roots of the crops and of such bushes the currant then the glowworm is beetle perhaps you may have seen its little pale green lamp shining in the grass on summer evening the light comes from liquid inside the hind part of the body the skin of which is transparent and forms kind of window so that it can shine through and the insect has the power of turning on its light and shutting it off at will the lamp of the female beetle is very much brighter than that of the male and while the male has both and wings and can ﬂy very well indeed those of the female are so small that one can hardly see them indeed she looks much more like grub than beetle deathw atches and il eetles deathwatches are small brown beetles which burrow into dead wood and call to one another by tapping with their horny heads you may often hear them if you happen to be lying awake at night in room in which there is old woodwork and in former days people were silly enough to think that when this sound was heard it was sign that somebody in the house was going to die that is why these beetles are called deathwatches they are quite small and are brown in color with rather long feelers and legs crawling on grassy banks in the warm sunshine on bright spring days you may often see number of these are large insects which have an odd habit if you pick them up of squeezing out little drops of yellow oily liquid from the joints of their legs this oil has pungent smell and doubt prevents birds from eating them you will notice that the female beetles have enormous hind bodies which they can hardly drag along over the ground this is because they contain such very large number of eggs thirty thousand often being laid by single beetle she places them in batches in holes in the ground and very soon afterw ard they hatch and little grubs with six long legs come out of them sooner have they left the than these tiny creatures hunt about ﬂower with sweet juices which is likely to be visited by wild bee when they ﬁnd one they climb up the stem and hide among the petals then when the bee comes they spring upon it and cling to its hairy body and so are carried back to its nest where they feed upon the food which the bee had stored up its little ones weevils and ther b eetles 358 359 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https great many beetles have long beak in front of the head with the jaws at the very tip these are called weevils and many of them are very mischievous grain of various kinds example is destroyed in enormous quantities by the and the weevil while the is the cause of those bad nuts which doubt most of you know only too well the mother beetle bores hole through the shell of the nut while it is small and the little grub which hatches out from the egg she leaves inside it feeds upon the kernel leaving nothing behind but quantity of black dust one of the handsomest of european insects is the which you may often ﬁnd sunning itself on the trunks and leaves of in england in july often you can smell it long before you ﬁnd it it gives out strong odor much like that of musk this beetle is sometimes nearly an inch and half long with long legs and still longer waving black feelers in color it is rich golden green with tinge of copper but if you put one of its under the microscope it looks like piece of green velve t studded all over with diamonds and rubies and sapphires and emeralds and topazes which seem to turn into one another with every change of light the grub of this beetle lives inside the trunks of dying and feeds upon the solid wood then there are the little black beetles with yellow stripe on each case which skip about just ﬂeas by means of their hind legs they are only too common in and often most serious mischief nibbling off the of the young plants soon they push their way above the surface of the ground and so destroying the greater part or even the whole of the crop and lastly there are the ladybirds common everywhere but perhaps you did not know that they are among the most useful of insects the fact is that both grubs and perfect insects they live upon the green blight or greenﬂy an aphis which is terribly mischievous in ﬁelds and gardens and destroy it in thousands of thousands indeed if it were not ladybirds and one or two other insects which help them in their task we should ﬁnd it quite impossible to grow certain crops at all insects injurious to american maple trees boring b eetle plagionotus 1 place where egg was laid 2 borer or

woolly mass 12 leaf with young on its under side euplexoptera 360 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https after the beetles comes the order of the euplexoptera which means beautifully folded wings this order contains the earwigs we not know much about these insects in the united states but they are so constantly spoken of in books about england where they are numerous that it will be well to describe them perhaps you did not know that earwigs have wings and certainly one does not often see these beetles ﬂying but nevertheles s they have very large and powerful wings only during the daytime while they are not being used these organs are folded away in the most beautiful manner under the tiny by night however earwigs often ﬂy and when they settle they fold up their wings most cleverly by means of the horny pincers at the of their bodies and then pull the down over them that is the real use of the pincers although the earwig is able to give quite smart pinch with them if it is interfered with another very curious fact about the earwig is that the mother insect heaps her eggs together into little pile and sits over them until they are hatched if you turn over large stones early in the spring you may often ﬁnd mother earwig watching over her eggs in this odd manner and she will allow herself to be torn in pieces rather than desert her charge orthoptera next comes this order the name of which means insects from the way in which the wings are folded this order contains many very insects there is the cockroach example which is so common and so mischievous in our houses it is often called the black beetle although it is not beetle at all and is not black but dark reddish brown it is remarkable several reasons one is that while the male has large and broad powerful wings those of the female are very small indeed so that she can not possibly ﬂy and another is that the eggs are laid in kind of horny purse about quarter of an inch long with sort of clasp on one side these little purses are hidden away in all sorts of dark corners and if you open one you will ﬁnd two rows of little eggs inside it arranged rather like the peas in pod the crickets too belong to this order of course you have often heard the big black cricket chirping merrily away in the ﬁelds and in europe they have kind called the which comes into the house and is often spoken of the cricket on the hearth in the kitchen it is not correct however to speak of the note or song of this insect it is not produced in the throat at all but is caused by rubbing one of the upon the other you will notice on looking at cricket that in each there is kind of stout horny rib which starts from thickened spot in the middle now in the right this rib is notched like ﬁle and when it is rubbed sharply upon the other the loud chirping noise is produced the feelers of the cricket are very long and slender and at the end of the body of the male are two long hairy bristles which seem almost like second pair of feelers warning the insect of danger approaching from behind at the end of the body of the female is long spear organ with tip this is called the ovipositor and by means of it the eggs are laid in holes punched in the soil crickets have large wings and ﬂy rather like the woodpeckers rising and falling in the air at every stroke another kind of cricket lives in holes in the ground which it digs by means of its front legs these limbs are formed almost exactly like the fore feet of the mole and this reason the insect is known the it is generally found in sandy ﬁelds and scoops out chamber almost big hen egg at the end of its burrow in which to lay its eggs and where it lies showing only its jaws and great front legs until some small creature comes near upon which it may pounce food grasshoppers 361 362 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https here has come mixing up of names between the english spoken and written in great britain and that used in the united states when an englishm an speaks of grasshopper he means the related insect which we call cicada or katydid and this we call locust but when he says locust he refers to what we call grasshopper we suspect he is nearer right than we are who have unfortunately fallen in with the mistake of some ignorant early settler at any rate the locusts of which we read in the bible and in books of travel in desert regions are all of the same race our grasshoppers none of the cicada tribe could ever so much damage grasshoppers to stick to our own name abound in all warm countries especially in those which in summer at least are hot and dry such egypt or syria or parts of india they feed exclusively on leaves blades of grass and the like and are strong ﬂiers and in countries that are favorable to them where they are always very plentiful certain species sometimes become excessively abundan t and then spread over the land and swarm away to neighboring countries in such immense numbers that they devour every green leaf and every blade of grass or spear of grain until they leave the ground bare if it had been swept by ﬁre nor is this the worst wherever they go the females push quantities of eggs down into the ground the following summer these eggs hatch and the devastation of the previous year is repeated where before dense clouds of ﬂying grasshoppers descended from the sky now enormous armies of grubs march over the ground climb all the plants and bushes and devour all that has newly sprung up millions may be killed by ﬁre or other means but it has little effect and the farmers and grazers of region so visited are all but wholly so when in the last century men began to settle on the prairies of the far west they met this plague and between 1870 and 1880 the gardens and farms and young orchards of kansas nebraska and other western districts were ruined again and again the government sent out several of the wisest entomologists it could employ to study the insects and they found that these destructive grasshoppers had their home in the dry foothills of the rocky mountains especially toward the north they learned great deal about the habits of the insects and reported that there seemed remedy just at hand but that the more the west was settled and cultivated the more grass and other food would be provided the grasshoppers so that they would not have to make those wide ﬂights and the more the plowing of the land and burning of rubbish woul d destroy their eggs so that gradually the pest would become less and less until ﬁnally it would cease to be troublesome this has turned out to be true and already the fear of grasshoppers has departed the same thing is taking place in egypt and some other improving countries which longer suffer from the plague of locusts they used to the wonderful and the also belong to this order they are so marvelously like the objects after which they are named that long they keep still it is almost impossible to see them they seem to know this perfectly well and will remain hours together without moving waiting some unwary insect to come within reach they are among the insects of prey they are found in all the warmer parts of the world equally curious too is the tis which also is very much like leaf it has very long front legs with row of sharp teeth running along their inner margin and when it is hungry it holds these limbs over its head in very much the attitude of prayer that is why it is called the then when an insect comes withi n reach it strikes at it and seizes it between the upper and lower parts of these limbs so that the long teeth enter its body and hold it in grip from which there is escape these occur in various parts of the world including the warmer parts of america dragon flies and m ay flies the belong to another divis ion of the orthoptera you must know these insects very well by sight with their long slender bodies and their broad gauzy wings they are common in almost all parts of the country and you can hardly go ramble on 363 364 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https sunny day in summer or autumn without seeing them in numbers there are good many different kinds some have yellow bodies some blue ones and some red ones and the loveliest of all perhaps are the graceful demoiselles whose wings are rich metallic purple you may sometimes see these beautiful insects ﬂitting to and fro over streams and ditches all the spend the earlier part of their lives in the water the grubs are very curious creatures and catch their prey in curious way underneath the head is an organ called the mask this consists of two horny joints which fold upon one another while not in use at the end of the second joint is pair of great jaws and when the grub sees victim it swims quietly underneath it unfolds the mask reaches up and seizes it with the jaws then it folds the mask again and by so doing drags the prisoner down against the true jaws by means of which it is leisurely devoured this grub swims too in singular manner at the end of its body you will notice short sharp spike now this spike really consists of ﬁve points which can be opened out into the form of star and in the center of this star is small round hole which is really the entrance to tube running right through the middle of the body and the grub swims by ﬁlling this tube with water and then squirting it out again with all its force so that the escaping jet pushes it were against the surrounding water and drives the insect swiftly forward by the recoil are voracious and always seem to be hungry they feed entirely upon other insects and spend almost all their time in chasing and devouring them the or also belongs to this order one sometimes sees it in thousands dancing it were up and down in the air toward evening on warm spring days in the neighborhood of water you can always tell this insect by the three long bristles at the end of its body most people think that this insect only lives single day this however is not strictly true in damp weather many live three or four days before they become perfect ﬂies however they have lived nearly two years in the muddy banks of rivers and ponds in the form of long slender grubs these grubs always make their burrows with two entrances in the form of the letter u turned sideways so that they can easily leave them without having to turn round termites the most wonderful of all the insects which belong to this order however are the termites often these creatures are know n white ants and although they are not really ants they are certainly very much like them in africa they make marvelous nests of clay which are often twelve or fourteen feet high and are so very large that church parsonage and schoolroom have been built of clay slabs cut from the walls of single termites nest these nests are made up of wonderful series of chambers and galleries and in the middle is the royal cell in which the king and queen live in every termites nest there is one perfect male and one perfect female which are treated with very great respect and have kind of palace it were all to themselves and the rest of the insects in the nest are either imperfect males which are called soldiers or imperfect females which are called workers the king is quite handsome and graceful insect with broad and powerful wings and the queen at ﬁrst is very much like him but they never take more than one ﬂight in the air and soon that is over they actually break off their own wings close to their bodies then they burrow into the ground and begin to form nest before long the workers build the palace the royal couple and soon they have been shut up inside it the body of the queen swells to most enormous size so that she can longer walk at all this is because of the vast number of eggs developing within her body which she at once begins to lay at the rate of many thousands in single day fast she lays them they are carried off by the workers which also take care of the little grubs that hatch out from them just bees 365 366 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https duty of the soldiers their name implies is simply to ﬁght and if hole is broken in the side of the nest they hurry to the spot at once and begin to snap with their jaws at the foe and these jaws are so sharp and so powerful that they can really give very smart bite the workers are good deal smaller and they have to build the nest and keep it in repair to ﬁnd food the grubs and take care of them and wash them and feed them and everything else that is necessary the welfare of the colony the grubs of these insects are fed upon dead wood which is generally obtained from the trunks and branches of trees but termites are sometimes very troublesome in houses they will devour the woodwork and the furniture and the books leaving nothing but thin shell of wood or paper behind them there are good many different kinds of these wonderful insects and they are found in warm countries in all parts of the world the north american termites not build great clay hills or houses above ground but some species make extensive galleries beneath the surface while others hollow out dead stump or the dying branch of tree or even an old or telegraph pole until it becomes mere sponge with thin outside shell neuroptera the neur optera or insects form an order whose wings are divided up by horny nerves or nervures into such numbers of tiny cells that they look if they were made of the most delicate lace the belong to this insects with long feelers and broad wings which are folded tentwise over the body when they are not being used they are very common near ponds and streams in which they pass the earlier part of their lives living down at the bottom in most curious cases which cover them entirely up with the exception of their heads these cases are made of all sorts of materials some merely fasten two dead leaves together face to face and live between them others make kind of tube out of grains of sand or tiny stones or little bits of cut reed all neatly stuck together with kind of glue which resists the action of water but the oddest case of all is made of tiny living water and you may someti mes see ﬁfteen or twenty little snails all trying to crawl in different directions while the grub is unconcernedly pulling them along in another the grubs never leave these cases but drag them about with them wherever they go and when they ﬁnd that their odd little homes are becoming too small they just cut off little piece at the end and add little piece on in front rather larger in diameter and so they always manage to keep their homes of exactly the proper size most likely too you have heard of the ﬂy which is rather large ﬂy with slender body and four long narrow wings and is found in many parts of the south of europe well in america but the interest lies in the grub or proper which has most singular way of catching its insect victims it digs pit in the sand about three inches in diameter and two inches deep by means of its front legs and its head then it almost buries itself at the bottom and lies in wait to snap up any ants or other small insects which may be unfortunate enough to fall in and if by any chance they should escape its terrible jaws and try to clamber up the sides it jerks up quantity of sand at them and brings them rolling down again to the bottom so that they may be seized second time relation of the is called the lacewing ﬂy and is pretty insect with most delicate gauzy wings over which if you look at them in good light all the colors of the rainbow seem to be playing and its eyes glow so brightly with ruby light that one can scarcely help wondering if little red lamp is burning inside its head you may often see it sitting on fence on warm summer day or ﬂitting slowly to and fro in the evening this ﬂy lays its eggs in clusters on twig or the surface of leaf each egg being fastened to the tip of slender stalk the result is that they not look like 367 368 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https at all they look much more like little tuft of moss when they hatch number of queer little grubs come out which at once begin to wander about in search of the little greenﬂy insects upon which they feed and when they have sucked their victims dry they always fasten the empty skins upon their own backs till at last they are covered over so completely that you can not see them at all chapter xxxiii insects continued we now come to very large and important order of insects of the hymenoptera this name means and has been given to them because their wings are made of transparent membrane stretched upon light horny framework it is not very good name however many insects which not belong to this order at all have their wings made in just the same way all the hymenoptera however have the upper and lower wings fastened together during ﬂight by row of tiny hooks which are set on the front margin of the lower pair and ﬁt into fold on the lower margin of the upper ones bees the bees belong to this order and most wonderful insects they wonderful indeed that big book might easily be written about them they are divided into two groups namely social bees and solitary bees the social bees are those which live together in nests and our ﬁrst examp le of course must be the in every beehive there are three kinds of bees first there are the drones which you can easily tell by their stoutly built bodies and their very large eyes they are the idlers of the hive doing work at all and sleeping about twenty hours out of every four six or eight weeks they live only to enjoy themselves but at last the other bees become tired of providing food them so they drive them all down to the bottom of the hive and sting them to death one after another and that is the end of the drones next comes the queen the mistress of the hive you can easily recognize her too her body is much longer and more slender than that of the other bees and her folded wings are always crossed at the tips the other bees treat her with the greates t respect never example turning their backs toward her and wherever she goes number of them bear her company forming circle round her in readiness to feed her or lick her with their tongues or anything else her that she may happen to want her chief business is to lay eggs and she often lays two or three hundred in the course of single day lastly there are the workers there are many thousands of these and they have to all the work of the hive making wax and honey building the combs and feeding and tending the young the comb is made of cells and is double two sets of cells being placed back to back some of these cells are used storing up honey but great many of them are nurseries so to speak in which the grubs are brought up these grubs are quite helpless and the have to come and put food into their mouths several times day fastened to the outside of the combs there are always several cells of quite different shape they are almost like pears in form with the smaller ends downward these are the royal nurseries in which the queen grubs are brought up 369 370 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https feed their little ones with curious kind of jelly made partly of honey and partly of the pollen of ﬂowers this is called and it is rather strange to ﬁnd that one kind of is given to the grubs of the drones and the workers while quite different kind is given to those of the queens you will want of course to know something about the sting of the perhaps you already know enough of the pain it can give this is soft organ enclosed in horny sheath with number of little barbs at the tip when bee stings us it is often unable to draw the sting out again because of these barbs so it is left behind in the wound and its loss injures the body of the insect so severely that the bee very soon dies the poison is stored up in little bag at the base of the sting which is arranged in such way that when the sting is used tiny drop of poison is forced through it and so enters the wound then doubt you would like to know how bees make honey but that neither we nor any one can tell you all we know is that the bee sweeps out the sweet juices of ﬂowers with its odd tongue and swallows them that they pass into little bag just inside the hind part of its body which we call the and that by the time the bee reaches the hive they have been turned into honey but how or why the change takes place one knows at all bumblebees or humblebees are also social bees but their nests are not quite wonderful those of the and their combs are not so cleverly made one of these bees is called the carder and you may sometimes ﬁnd its nest in hollow in bank but it is not at all easy to see the bee covers over the hollow with kind of roof which is made of moss and lined with wax and this looks so like the surrounding earth that even the sharpe st eye may often pass it by when this roof is ﬁnished the bee makes kind of tunnel eight or ten inches long and about half an inch in diameter to serve an entrance and this is built of moss and lined with wax in just the same way on warm sunny day in spring you may often see one of these bees ﬂying up and down grassy bank searching suitable burrow in which to build then you may be quite sure that she is queen among bumblebees the drones and workers die early in the autumn and only the queens live through the winter solitary bees are very common almost everywhere and you may ﬁnd their nests in all sorts of odd places one kind of solitary bee example builds in empty and another in small hollows like keyholes third gnaws out burrow in the decaying trunk of an old tree or in the timbers of barn or and makes number of cells out of little semicircular bits of which it cuts out with its scissor jaws have you noticed how often the leaves of are chipped round the edges quite large pieces being frequently cut away well that is the work of the bee this insect is called and very often not single leaf on bush is left untouched but the commonest of all the solitary bees burrows into the ground you walk along the pathway through meadow in spring you may often see round hole in the ground just about large enough to admit an ordinary that is the entrance to the burrow of solitary bee and if you could follow the tunnel down into the ground you would ﬁnd that it was about eight or ten inches deep and that at the bottom were four round cells in each of these cells the bee lays an egg then it ﬁlls the cells with ﬂies or spiders and caterpillars or beetles the little grubs to feed upon when they hatch out solitary bees not nurse their little ones social bees and feed them several times day but at the same time the grubs are quite helpless and can not possibly go to look food themselves so the mother bee has to store up sufﬁcient to last them until the time comes them to spin their cocoons and pass into the chrysalis state these are only few examples of large number of interesting ways in which the solitary bees in various parts of the world provide their young wasps 371 372 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https make nests which are almost wonderful those of the that of the common wasp is generally placed in hole in the ground or in cavity under stone and is made of substance very much like coarse paper which the wasps manufacture by chewing wood into kind of pulp you may often see them sitting on fence or on the trunk of dead tree busily engaged in scraping off shreds of wood this purpose when the nest is ﬁnished it is often big football and of very much the same shape and inside it are several stories it were of cells placed one above another and supported by little pillars of the same paper material these cells are like those of the but they are squared off at the ends instead of being produced into pointed caps and they always have their mouths downward in large nest there may be several thousands of these cells and very often three generations of grubs are brought up in them one after the other the hornet which is really kind of big wasp makes its nest in just the same way but places it on beam in an or in hole which the sparrows have made in the thatched roof of house or in hollow tree or perhaps hangs it in the open air to the bough of tree ants even more wonderful than bees and wasps are the ants which sometimes such extraordinary things that we are almost afraid to tell you about them fear that you might not believe us there are ants example which actually take other ants prisoners and make them act slaves forcing them to all the work of the nest which they are too lazy to themselves and there are ants which keep large armies sometim es more than one hundred thousand strong and there are many ants which harvest grain and store it away in under ground barns many ants too keep little beetles in their nests pets and fondle and caress them just one might pat dog or stroke favorite cat they even allow them to ride on their backs while if the nest is opened the ﬁrst thing they think of is the safety of their pets which they pick up at once and hide away in some place of safety even before they carry off their own eggs and young they also pet tiny crickets and small white in just the same way then ants have little cows of their own which they milk regularly every day these are the greenﬂy or aphis insects which so much harm in our gardens and ﬁelds plunging their beaks into the tender shoots and fresh green leaves of the plants and sucking up their sap unceasingly and fast they so they pour the sap out again through two little tubes in their backs in the form of thin sticky very sweet liquid which we call honeydew now the ants are very fond of this liquid and if you watch the greenﬂy insects which are almost always so plentiful on you may see the ants come and tap them with their feelers then the little creatures will pour out small quantity of honeydew from the tubes on their backs which the ants will lick up that is the way in which ants milk their little cows and they are so fond of the honeydew that they will carry large numbers of these aphides into their nests and keep them like herd of cattle all through the winter so that they may never be without supply of their favorite beverage ants like bees and wasps almost always consist of drones queens and workers only the drones and queens have wings and these are seldom seen until the end of august but then they make their appearance in vast swarms which are sometimes so dense that from little distance the insects really look like column of smoke they only take one short ﬂight however and when this is over they come down to the ground and snap of f their wings close to their bodies just termites one of the most curious of all these insects is the of south america which makes enormous nests of clay but the clay will not bind properly by itself the insects work little pieces of green leaf up with it these pieces of leaf are generally obtained from an orange plantation perhaps half mile distant and when the ants are returning from their expedition each holds its little piece of leaf over its head it marches along just if it were carrying tiny green parasol 373 374 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https very famous ant is the african driver which owes its name to the way its vast armies drive every living creature before them insects reptiles antelopes monkeys even man himself must give way before the advancing hosts of the drivers it is certain death to stand in their path lies the also belong to the order of the hymenoptera these ﬂies are so called because the female insects have two little saws at the end of the body which work in turns one being pushed forward the other is drawn back with these they cut little grooves in the bark of twigs or in the midribs of leaves in which they place their eggs by means of the ovipositor between the saws some of these insects are extremely mischievous the grub of the turnip instance often destroys whole ﬁelds of turnips while the currant is equally destructive to currants and gooseberries one often sees bushes which it has entirely stripped of their leaves you may always know grub by the fact that it has less than pairs of true legs on the front part of the body and eight pairs of false legs or prolegs they are often called on the hinder part there is one little family of however which are quite unlike all the rest instead of having saws at the ends of their bodies they have long boring instruments very much like with these they bore deep holes in the trunks of in order to place their eggs at the bottom and the grubs feed when they hatch out on the solid wood these insects are known and one which is very common in pine woods is very large sometimes measuring an inch and half from the head to the tip of the tail and very nearly three inches across the wings while the boring tool is fully an inch long it is very handsome insect and looks rather like hornet the head and thorax being deep glossy black and the hind body bright yellow with broad black belt round the middle the feelers are also yellow and the legs are partly yellow and partly black gall lies another group of the hymenoptera consists of the these are all small insects which lay their eggs in little holes which they bore in roots twigs and the ribs and nervures of leaves in each hole together with the egg they place tiny drop of an irritating liquid which causes swelling to take place on the substance of which the little grub feeds sometimes these galls they are called take most curious forms the pretty red and white of course you know and doubt too you have often found the hard woody galls which are so common on the twigs of the same tree then some galls look like bunches of currants and some look like scales and some look like pieces of sponge and if you cut one of them open you will ﬁnd perhaps one little grub or perhaps several curled up inside them 375 376 the project gutenberg ebook of the

lay their eggs in the bodies of caterpillars or chrysalids and sometimes in those of spiders boring holes to receive them by means of their little ovipositors before long the eggs hatch and the little grubs at once begin to feed upon the ﬂesh of their victims some little time strange to say the unfortunate creature seems to suffer pain or even discomfort but goes on feeding and growing just before although hundreds of hungry little grubs may be nibbling away inside it sooner or later however it dies and then the little grubs spin cocoons and turn to chrysalids out of which other little ﬂies appear in due course just like the parents millions of caterpillars are destroyed by these little ﬂies every year out of every hundred of those which so much damage to our cabbages and cauliﬂowers example at least ninety are sure to be stung indeed if it were not we should ﬁnd it quite impossible to grow any crops at all they would all be eaten up by caterpillars lepidoptera next we come to the butterﬂies and moths which are called lepidoptera or winged insects because their wings are covered with thousands upon thousands of tiny scales if you catch butterﬂy kind of mealy dust comes off upon your ﬁngers and if you look at little of this dust through microscope you ﬁnd that it consists simply of little scales of all sorts of shapes some are like battledores and some like masons trowels and they are nearly always most beautifully sculptured and chiseled these scales lie upon the wing in rows which overlap one another like the slates on the roof of house and sometimes there are several millions on the wings of single insect butterflies it is possible here of course to mention only few of the most striking forms of butterﬂies out of the many hundreds of species counted north american it may be said that these insects are much alike in general features all round the northern half of the 377 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https the same families being represen ted so that at ﬁrst glance european or asiatic examples of such butterﬂies the great yellow swallowtail seem the same american examples among the handsomest of all northern butterﬂies is the purple emperor whic h you may sometimes see ﬂying round the tops of the tallest trees in large woods in the south of england far commoner however are the large small and whites whose caterpillars are so destructive to cabbages the scarlet admiral with broad streaks of vermilion across its glossy black wings the peacock with its four blue spots on russet ground the mottled with yellow and brown and black and the pretty little blues which one may see in almost every meadow from the middle of may till the end of september then there are the brimstone with its pale yellow wings which with the blues dance along the roadways in little whirling companies all summer the and the large heath to be seen in thousands in every hayﬁeld the small heath and the small copper even more plentiful still the fritillaries some of which live in woods and some on downs and some in marshy meadows the pretty with pure white wings tipped with yellow and the odd little skippers which ﬂit merrily about grassy banks in the warm sunshine in may and again in several others which are so scarce or so local that hardly anybody ever sees them moths you can easily tell moths from butterﬂies by looking at their antennæ or feelers which have knobs at the tips those of butterﬂies have their number also is very great and we can mention only few of the most remarkable first among these is the splendid sphinx or hawk the largest of all the insects which sometimes measures ﬁve inches from tip to tip of its wings when they are fully spread it owes its name to the curious patch of hairs on its thorax which looks just like skull the caterp illar is huge yellowish creature often nearly six inches long with blue horn at the end of its body and seven blue stripes edged with white on either side it lives in elds hiding under ground by day and coming out at night to feed upon the leaves and it is an odd fact that both the caterpillar and the perfect insect have the power of squeaking rather loudly the moth appears in october the ﬂies by day and you may often see it hovering over ﬂowers in the garden with its long trunk poked down into blossom in order to suck up the sweet juices it does so it makes quite loud humming noise with its wings like the little bird from which it takes its name and sometimes you may see which has transparent wings hovering in front of rhododendron blossoms in just the same way the swifts ﬂy between sunset and dark and the largest of them is very curious indeed although it has glossy white wings so that one can see it quite clearly in the dusk it will suddenly disappear the fact is that although its wings are white above they are yellowish brown below so that when it suddenly settles and folds them over its back it at once becomes invisible the are large heavily built insects with wings marked with number of very short upright dark streaks the caterpillar is great creature with broad chocolate band running down its back it lives three years in the trunks of various trees and then spins silken cocoon in which to turn to chrysalis have brown fore wings streaked with white scarlet hind wings with spots and bright scarlet body the caterpillar which is very common in gardens is generally called the woolly bear because of the long brown hairs which cover its body very beautiful indeed are the burnets which have front wings with either ﬁve or six large red spots and crimson hind wings edged with black you may often see them resting on ﬂowers and by the roadside in the hot sunshine and in some parts of the country the cinnabar is almost equally plentiful you can recognize it at once by the crimson hind wings and by the streak and the two spots of the same color on 378 379 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https front ones the caterpillar which is bright orange in color with black rings round its body feeds upon ragwort the c urious v aporer the vaporer is very common toward the end of summer and even in london one may often see it dashing about in the hot sunshine with strange jerky ﬂight but one only sees the male which is bright insect measuring about an inch across the wings the female is much more like grub than perfect insect and has wings so small that they are hardly visible of course she can not ﬂy and her body is so big and clumsy that she can not even walk so she spends her life clinging to the outside of the cocoon in which she passed the chrysalis state and covers it all over with her little round white eggs and when she has laid the last of these she falls to the ground and dies very handsome indeed is the emperor which has big spot in the middle of each wing something like those of the but its caterpillar is even more beautiful still its body is of the loveliest color sprinkled all over with little pink tubercles each of which is enclosed in ring of black and has tuft of glossy black hairs sprouting from it this caterpillar feeds on bramble and heather and when it reaches its full size it spins cocoon among the leaves of its plant and then turns to chrysalis from which the perfect moth hatches out in the following april very often one ﬁnds caterpillars which look just like little bits of stick and which walk in most curious fashion by hunch ing up their backs into loops and then stretching them out again just if they were measuring the ground these caterpillars are called loopers and they turn into moths with lar ge broad wings and very slender bodies there are great many kinds of these moths one called the swallowtail may often be found hiding among ivy in july it has large wings of color with little tails upon the hinder pair then there are the sulphur smaller insect with wings of brighter yellow the emeralds of the most delicate green the magpie which has wings of the purest white marked with streaks of orange and numbers of almost square black spots and blotches and many others far too numerous to mention if you ever shake bush in summer you may see quite dozen of them ﬂying away to seek some fresh then there is large moth known the puss because it is colored rather like brindled gray cat the caterpillar is bright green with big hump in the middle of its body and two long organs at the end of its tail with which it will sometimes pretend to be able to sting you but in reality it is perfectly harmless you may often ﬁnd it feeding on the leaves of in august and when it is fully fed it spins hard oval cocoon in crack in the bark and there are three smaller moths belonging to the same family which are known kittens another very large group of moths is that of the noctuæ or but we so seldom see these unless we go out specially to look them that we shall pass them by without further mention homoptera the next order is that of the homoptera or insects which are so called because their upper and lower wings are just alike the froghoppers all belong to this order you know them they are little brown or gray insects sometimes marked or marbled with white which carry their wings folded tentwise over their backs and hop about with really wonderful activity it has been calculated that if man of ordinary height could leap well froghopper in proportion to his greater size he would be able to cover nearly quarter of mile at single jump but if you not know the froghoppers by sight you must at any rate know something of their grubs these are the creatures which cause the of which one sees so much during the early summer very often the weeds and long grass in 380 381 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https or by the roadside are almost covered with the odd little masses of froth so that one feet get quite wet one walks through the herbage and in the middle of each mass is fat little grub which is sucking up the sap of the plant upon which it is resting and pouring it out again in frothy bubbles the mischievous little aphides or green ﬂy insects also belong to this order there are many different kinds some of which terrible damage to hops and corn and all sorts of cultivated plants we have already mentioned these when describing the habit s of ants and you will recollect that they have sharp little beaks which they thrust into young shoots and tender leaves in order to suck up the sap and that fast they so they pour it out again through two little tubes upon their backs in the form of the thin sweet and very sticky liquid which we call honeydew you will remember too how fond ants are of this liquid and how they milk the tiny insects just if they were little cows so you see the aphides injure plants in two ways first they draw off all their sap which is really their and then they drop this sticky honeydew on to the leaves below and choke up the little holes by means of which they breathe and the worst of it is that these insects multiply so rapidly where there is one there will be ﬁve and twenty and two days later there will be ﬁve and twenty times ﬁve and twenty and two days later still there will be ﬁve and twenty times ﬁve and twenty times ﬁve and twenty indeed if it were not ladybirds and lacewing ﬂies and one or two other insects which feed upon aphides every green leaf would be destroyed by them in few months time very curious fact about these insects is that long they can ﬁnd plenty of food they not grow any wings but soon the sap becomes scanty or thin wings make their appearance so that they can ﬂy away and seek better food elsewhere heteroptera the order of the homoptera or insects is followed by that of the heter optera or insects in which that part of the wings nearest to the body is hard and leathery while the rest is softer and thinner and is general ly almost transparent some of these live upon land while others spend most of their lives in the water the curious belong to the former group there are good many kinds and some of them are very common you may see them sitting upon ﬂowers or resting upon raspberries and blackberries in the sunshine but although they are sometimes very pretty we not advise you to handle them they have the power of pouring out liquid which will make your ﬁngers smell very nasty indeed and you should be most careful not to eat any fruit on which they have been resting they leave horrible ﬂavor behind them which is even worse than the smell among those which live in the water there are several most interesting insects there are the water example which you can see running about on the surface of any pond and which look like spiders but you will notice that they only have six legs whereas true spiders always have eight they skim about on the water by means of the middle and hinder limbs the front pair being used in catching prey and when they have caught victim they suck its juices through their sharp little beaks then there is the water which always swims on its back the reason why it does so is that when its body is in that position it is shaped just like boat while its long hind legs serve pair of oars so the little insect really rows itself through the water on bright sunny day you may often see it resting on the surface of pond with its hind legs thrown forward in readiness stroke and if even your shadow falls upon it or it feels the vibration of heavy footstep it will dive down in moment to some place among the weeds if you ever catch water be careful how you handle it or it will give your ﬁnger very painful prick with its sharp beak 382 383 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https water too is very curiou it is ﬂat oval insect of color which looks very much like piece of dead leaf it seems to know this quite well when it is hungry it always hides among dead leaves down at the bottom of the water and keeps perfectly still then the other insects not notice it and soon one of them comes within reach it seizes it with its great front legs and plunges its beak into its body this insect is called the water because it has long spike at the end of its body which looks something like scorpion sting it is really however the top of which is poked just above the surface of the water while the insect is lying at the bottom so to enable it to breathe quite easily aphaniptera the order of the aphaniptera or insects is very small one consisting only of the ﬂeas the name has been given to them because their wings are so tiny that even with the microscope they can hardly be seen at all there are good many different kinds of ﬂeas all of which suck the blood of animals through their sharp little beaks some of them are able to leap to really wonderful distance by means of their powerful hind legs and they are so wonderfully strong that if man were equally powerful in proportion to his greater size he would easily be able to drag wagon which pair of could scarcely move diptera the last order of insects is that of the diptera or ﬂies which seem to have two wings only instead of four but if you look at them closely you will see pair of little organs just where the hind wings ough t to be and these little organs which we call balancers are really the hind wings in very much altered form although they are so tiny and look so useless these balancers are used in some way during ﬂight if they are damaged or lost the insect can longer balance itself or direct its course in the air the m osquit the mosquito is troublesome insect which most of us know only too well there are very few of us who have not suffered from the wounds caused by its beak its history is very interesting the eggs which are shaped just like tiny skittles are laid in the water and the mother gnat fastens them cleverly together in such way that they form little boat which ﬂoats on the surface after time little door opens at the bottom of each egg and tiny grub tumbles out into the water it is very little creature with very small head very big thorax and very long tail and it mostly ﬂoats in the water with its head downward and the tip of its tail resting just above the surface these grubs feed on the little scraps of decaying matter which are always ﬂoating in the water of the pond and they wriggle their way about in the strangest manner by ﬁrst doubling up their bodies and then stretching them out over and over again after time they throw off their skins and change to chrysalids and out of this few days later the perfect gnats make their appearance the mosquito is gnat that has many relatives some very troublesome like the black ﬂy some gnats have very big bushy feelers just like big plumes these are the males and you need not be afraid of them they have beaks and can not bite crane ly and d rone ly then there is the whose balancers you can see quite easily this insect lays it eggs in the ground and the grubs which hatch out from them are called leather because their skins are so very tough they feed upon the roots of grass and sometimes great deal of mischief in pastures indeed if it were not such birds the crow 384 385 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https which destroy them in enormous numbers we should ﬁnd it almost impossible to grow any grass at all the really does look rather like bee but it only has two wings instead of four while its body is much more stoutly built and it has sting so that you need not be in the least afraid of it you may often see it sitting on ﬂowers on sunny days in autumn and it is especially fond of those of the ragwort the grub of this ﬂy spends its whole life buried head downward in the mud at the bottom of some shallow black mud which is largely made up of decaying never comes out of it even to breathe but at the end of its body it has long tube the tip of which rests just above the surface of the water so that it can draw down much air it requires and this tube is made something like telescope so that if heavy fall of rain should raise the level of the water all that the grub has to is to push out another joint when it can breathe just easily before this grub is often known the maggot hawk lies tc you walk through wood in summer you may often see black and yellow ﬂy hovering in if you move it darts away so swiftly that the eye can not follow its ﬂight but if you stop and remain perfectly still it will come back again in moment or two and hover just before this is and it is very useful the mother insect always lays her eggs on twigs and leaves which are swarming with aphides on these insects the grubs feed so that soon they hatch out they ﬁnd themselves surrounded with prey and destroy the little insects in great numbers the and the bluebottle ﬂy also belong to the order of the diptera they are not very pleasant insects but while they are grubs they are really most useful they feed upon all sorts of decaying substances and another insect called the is even more useful still it is the parent of from sixteen to twenty thousand grubs so that if even single ﬂy ﬁnds the carcass of small animal and leaves her eggs upon it the little ones that soon hatch out will devour it in very short time in few days all these grubs turn into perfect ﬂies and in their turn become the parents of thousands of grubs so that it has been said that three of these ﬂies could devour dead ox fast lion could the last insect that we can mention is brown and gray ﬂy known the warble it is very troublesome indeed to cattle the mother ﬂy lays her eggs upon their backs then soon the grubs hatch they burrow underneath the skin of the poor animals and form large swellings there in which they spend the whole of their lives when they are fully fed they wriggle out through hole in the hide drop to the ground burrow into it and turn to chrysalids from which the perfect ﬂies appear few months later chapter xxxiv spiders and scorpions most people think that spiders are insects but this is very great mistake they are just about unlike insects they can possibly be insects example always have distinct heads but spiders never their heads are so sunk and lost in their chests that you can not possibly tell where the one leaves off and the other begins so that spiders have their bodies divided into two parts only instead of into three is always the case in the insects 386 387 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https insects always have six legs spiders always have eight insects have wings spiders have none insects have feelers spiders have none insects nearly always have great many eyes which are spiders never have more than eight eyes which are round and while insects may have biting jaws or sucking jaws or trunk or beak spiders always have which insect ever possesses so you see that far the outside of their bodies is concerned spiders are very different indeed from insects and the differences inside the body are just great insects have hearts the only in their bodies being one long tube which runs along the back but spiders have quite big heart and good many arteries well insects have lungs but breathe by means of slender tubes which run to every part of the body but spiders have quite big lungs in which the blood is puriﬁed just it is in our own insects have brains but only bunches of nerves in different parts of their bodies but spiders have quite big brains and besides this while all insects which spin silk produce it through their mouths spiders always so by means of organs at the very end of the body so that inside well outside there is hardly any respect in which spiders and insects really resemble one another the gans of spider are very wonderful indeed remember in the ﬁrst place that the silk long it remains in the body of the spider is kind of thick gum which is produced and stored up in six long narrow bags or glands then if you look at the end of spider body through good strong better still through will see several little projections which we call spinnerets now each of these spinnerets is covered with hundreds of tinier projections still every one of which has an extremely small hole in the middle and all these holes communicate by means of very slender tubes with one of the so what spider does when it wants to spin its line is to squeeze little drop of silk into one of the spinnerets it then just touches the object to which the line is to be fastened and draws its body away and it does so delicate thread comes out from every one of the projections on the spinn eret and all these threads unite together into one stout cord that is why spider thread is so strong it really consists of several hundred separate threads all ﬁrmly fastened together and if the spider wants to spin stronger line still it can unite all the threads coming from several spinnerets into one so to make very stout cord indeed spiders use this silk all sorts of different purposes in the ﬁrst place they use it snaring insects the g arden pider let us take an example the web of the common it is to be seen in every garden resting in the middle of its web and you may always recognize it by the white cross upon its back but i suppose that you have ever seen it spinning its net it always does so very early in the morning generally beginning before sunrise so that it may be quite ready use soon the insects begin to ﬂy first of all the spider makes kind of outer framework of very strong silken cords and fastens it ﬁrmly in position by stout of the same material next she carries thread right across the middle and ﬁxes it down on either side then starting from the center she carries thread after thread to the margin carefully testing the strength of each by giving it two or three smart pulls and fastening it ﬁrmly down when she has ﬁnished this part of her task the web looks like badly shaped wheel the next thing that the spider does is to spin little silken platform in the middle of her web to sit upon and soon she has done this she begins to spin the spiral thread beginning from the center she goes round and round and round fastening the thread down every time that it crosses one of the straight spokes it were of the at last the web is ﬁnished then she goes to the little platform in the middle and there remains upside down waiting an insect to blunder into her net by and by perhaps bluebottle ﬂy does so then she shakes the web violently few moments so to entangle it more thoroughly rushes down upon it seizes it and 388 389 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https her fangs into its body but if she catches wasp or bee she nearly always cuts it carefully out drops it to the ground and then patches up the hole in her web she knows perfectly well that wasps and bees can sting would you like to know why it is that ﬂies stick to the web soon they touch it the microscope shows us all the way along the spiral thread is set with very tiny drops of liquid gum so tiny are these drops indeed that there are between eighty and ninety thousand of them in large web and would you like to know why it is that the spider does not stick to the web the ﬂies well the fact is that only the spiral thread is set with these little gummy drops and that the spider runs about over her web she is most careful to place her feet only on the straight threads and never on the spiral line other spiders however snare their prey in quite dif ferent way the m armigna tto this small spider found on our western plains is remarkable feeding on large insects such grasshoppers and which it catches in an ingenious manner it stretches few silken threads across narrow path way quite close to the ground along which these insects are likely to pass and lies in wait just opposit until grasshopper or cricket approaches when it comes to the threads the insect is sure to get at least one of its feet entangled then it stops and tries to shake itself free the only result of its struggles of course is that its other feet become entangled too and while it is struggling the marmignatto springs upon its back fastens silken thread to it springs down again and fastens the other end to close by over and over again it does this and before very long the unfortunate insect is ﬁrmly fastened down by hundreds of threads and is quite unable to break free or even to move one of its legs then the spider leaps upon its back once more plunges its fangs into its body and proceeds to suck its blood hunting piders perhaps you may have seen little hairy black spiders with white markings upon the upper part of their bodies running about in an odd jerky way on sunny fences and walls these are called because they hunt their prey instead of snaring it you may see them gradually creeping up to ﬂy so slowly that they hardly seem to move and then suddenly leaping upon it when they are about two inches away then spider and ﬂy locked in one another embrace go falling toward the ground together but they never reach it wherever goes it always trails rope of silk behind it and fastens it down at intervals so when it springs from the fence it is brought up at once by its own thread and swings in the air till its victim is dead then it just climbs up its thread and so gets back to the fence piders these great spiders of the tropics hunt prey in much the same way only instead of catching ﬂies on walls they prowl about the branches of trees in search of small birds springing upon them when they are roosting at night and killing them almost immediately by smart bite from their venomous fangs these spiders of course are very large indeed the body of is big man ﬁst while its great hairy legs cover nearly square foot of ground when they are fully spread out trap door s piders these famous spiders are found more or less commonly in all warm countries they all live in tunnels in the ground which they dig by means of their fangs and they not want the situation of their nest to be discovered they carry the earth away to little distance fast they dig it up and carefully hide it very often the hole which they dig in this way is eighteen inches or two feet deep and at the bottom it always turns 390 391 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https an inch or two so that the general shape of the burrow is very much like that of stocking this hole is always dug in the side of bank so that when there is heavy fall of rain the water may run away without ﬂooding it when the burrow is ﬁnished the spider lines it throughout with two sheets of silk the outer sheet which comes next to the earth is rather coarse in texture and is quite waterproof in order to keep the tunnel dry the inner one is very much ﬁner and softer so that the little home may be comfortable possible soon the lining process is completed the spider sets to work on the this she makes in the cleverest manner possible first she measures the doorway most carefully by the aid of her feelers then she spins thin silken pad of exactly the same size and shape this is sticky on the top like the spiral thread of the web of the spider and she sprinkles it all over with very small scraps of earth upon this she fastens another silken pad which she sprinkle s with earth in the same way and then comes another and then another and so on till the door is sufﬁciently thick finally she fastens it in position by means of hinge which is also made of silk and she always places this hinge on the upper side of the doorway so that the door may fall down behind her by its own weight whenever she leaves the burrow she is rather lazy creature you see and does not want to have the trouble of shutting the door herself and if she left it open every passer would ﬁnd out where she had made her home the door always ﬁts most wonderfully into its place and the spider carefully covers the top with little bits of moss and small scraps of earth and stone so to make it exactly like the surface of the ground all round it indeed unless one happens to see the spider push it open it is almost impossible to ﬁnd it when one of these spiders is in her burrow she always fastens about half dozen silken threads to the inner side of the door carries them down to the bottom and sits with one of her feet resting upon each one can then try to force her door open without her knowledge and soon she feels the least pull upon the threads she rushes up the burrow clings to the walls with her hind feet seizes the door with her front ones and pulls it downward with all her might and if the door is forced open in spite of her efforts she slips into sort of side tunnel which she always makes near the top of her burrow and stays there until the danger is past the r aft pider there are several spiders which live on or in the water one of these is the which is found in the fen districts of england if you should happen to meet with it you can recognize it at once all round the upper part of its body is narrow band of yellow and inside this is row of small white spots this spider is about an inch long and owes its name to the fact that it actually makes little raft on which to go out searching water collecting together quantity of little bits of leaf and cut grass and reeds it fastens them ﬁrmly together with silken threads just shipwrecked sailors might lash planks together with ropes in order to escape from sinking vessel in this way it makes small ﬂoating platform perhaps couple of inches in diameter when the raft is ﬁnished the spider gets upon it pushes off from the shore and allows the current to carry it along by and by perhaps it catches sight of some water ﬂoating at the surface or of drowning ﬂy which has fallen into the stream then it leaves its raft runs along over the surface of the water seizes its victim and carries it back to the raft to be devoured and if it should be alarmed or think itself in danger it gets under the raft and clings to the lower surface so that it can not be seen from above the w ater pider more curious still is the water which actually makes its nest under water this spider which is almost black in color and has very hairy body and legs is common in ponds and canals and spends almost the whole of its life beneath the water its little 392 393 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https nest is shaped like thimble with the mouth downward and is placed among weeds to which it is ﬁrmly fastened down by also of silk and when it is ﬁnished the spider ﬁlls it with air she does this in most curious manner rising to the surface she turns upside down pokes her long hind legs out of the water and crosses the tips then she dives again carrying down big bubble of air between these hairy legs and her equally hairy body she does so she next gets exactly underneath the entrance to her nest and separates her legs the result is of course that the air ﬂoats up and occupies the upper part another bubble is now brought down in the same way and so the spider goes on fetching bubble after bubble until at last her little nest is comple tely ﬁlled with air then she gets inside it and watches the grubs of water to swim by in this wonderful nest the spider lays her eggs and brings up her family when the little ones have been hatched of course the air in the nest very soon becomes too impure to breathe then the little spiders cling tightly to the walls while the mother gets outside and tilts the whole nest sideways so that all the exhausted air ﬂoats up in one big bubble to the surface then she pulls the nest back into position hurries up to the top of the water and brings down bubble of air and then another and so on until the nest is ﬁlled with air all over again if you ever catch one of these spiders and keep it awhile in jar of water with little piece of water you may see it spinning its wonderful nest and ﬁlling it with air perhaps half dozen times day gossamers before we leave the spiders altogether we must tell you something abou t the wonderful little creatures called gossamers these are really the young of good many different kinds of spiders it often happens of course that several families with perhaps ﬁve or six hundred little ones in each are all living quite close to one another the result is that there is not sufﬁcient food them all so they make up their minds to go out into the world and seek their fortunes and this is how they it choosing warm sunny morning in the early part of the autumn all the little spiders climb the nearest bush and each one makes its way to the very tip of leaf then clinging ﬁrmly to its hold it begins to pour out very slender thread of silk from one of its spinnerets you know that on warm sunny days the air near the ground soon becomes heated and rises hot air always does and in rising it carries up these delicate gossamer they are called with it still the little spiders hold on and pour out their lines till at last each has several feet of thread rising straight up into the air above it then suddenly they all let go and are carried up into the air at the ends of their own threads so they go on up and up and up till at last they meet gentle breeze which carries them along with it so perhaps they travel thirty forty or ﬁfty miles or even farther still and when at last they make up their minds to descend all that they have to is to roll up the threads which have been supporting them and down they come ﬂoating gently back to earth one good name them is ballooning spiders have you sometimes found on warm autumn morning that all the trees and bushes and even the grass and low plants are quite covered with threads of silk the next time you see such sight look carefully and you will ﬁnd that on every thread little baby spider is sitting then you may be quite sure that all these little spiders set out early in the morning to seek their fortu nes and that borne up by their slende r threads they have traveled many long miles through the air scorpions these formidable creatures are closely related to the spiders they are found in all warm countries with the exception of new zealand and may easily be known by two facts in the ﬁrst place in front of the legs they have pair of great strong claws which look very much like those of crab and in the second place the last ﬁve joints of the body are narrowed into long slender tail at the end of which is sting when they attack an enemy or seize victim they grasp it with the claws turn the tail over the 394 395 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https and force the sting into its body and the poison which is introduced into the wound is so powerful that the sting of lar ge scorpion is almost severe the bite of an adder during the daytime scorpions hide away under stones and logs or in crevices in the ground or perhaps under the loose bark of dead trees but very soon after sunset they come out from their retreats and prowl about all night long in search of insects and it is at such times that they invade camps and houses get into shoes and persons get stung unless they are very careful centipedes and m illepedes one can easily recognize centipedes by the great number of their feet the name centipede indeed means none of these creatures however have exactly hundred limbs some only have ﬁfteen pairs of legs some have many one hundred and pairs but whether they be many or few the number of pairs is always odd another very curious fact about centipedes is that they have less than four pairs of jaws but the fourth pair take the form of fangs which are very stout and strong and very much curved while at their base just inside the head is little bag of poison in the northern centipedes which are quite small the fangs are not large enough nor the poison sufﬁciently strong to cause serious wound but some of the tropical species which grow to the length of nearly foot are quite venomous the lar gest scorpions the food of these creatures consists chieﬂy of worms and insects but the larger ones will kill lizards and even mice and have been known to prey upon victims actually larger than themselves the eggs of centipedes are laid in little clusters on the ground in some dark damp nook and when they have all been deposited the mother centipede coils herself round them and there remains guarding them until they hatch millepedes in some ways are very much like centipedes but they only have two pairs of jaws instead of four and they are nearly all the long smooth and slender julus millepedes are plentiful in every garden and in tropical countries they sometimes grow to length of six inches even the largest however are perfectly harmless they have the centipedes have and the only way in which they ever attempt to defend themselves is by pouring out small drop or two of ﬂuid which smells rather nasty and doubt protects them from the attacks of birds chapter xxxv crust aceans we now come to very important class of animals which includes the crabs the lobsters the shrimps and the prawns these creatures together with the mollusks are often called although the shell of crab is not in the least like the shell of an oyster example or like that of whelk or snail it is only sort of crust upon the skin made chieﬂy of carbonate of lime that is why these animals are called crust aceans and instead of growing like true shells this coat never increases in size at all but crabs and lobsters grow yes but not other animals little every day they only grow rule once year and they get whole twelvemonth growth into about two days when in warm weather the proper time approaches they hide away in some crevice among the rocks where none of their enemies are likely to ﬁnd them this is because they are going to throw off their shells and they know that when these are gone they will be deprived of their natural armor and of their weapons too and so will be 396 397 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https at the mercy even of foes much smaller than themselves then very strange thing happens part of their ﬂesh actually turns to water sometimes if you happen to take up crab in and shake it you will hear water swishing about inside it this is watery crab and is not good to eat it was just about to change its shell when it was caught good deal of its ﬂesh has actually turned to water now this always happens few days before the shell is thrown off and the animal wriggles and twists about inside it in order to loosen the attachments which bind it to its body it also rubs its feelers against its legs and its legs against one another in order to loosen their hard coverings in the same way this goes on perhaps three or four days then suddenly the shell splits across and the animal with tremendous effort springs right out of it while the shell closes up again and looks just it did before one might really think that there were two crabs instead of only one some little time the animal now lies perfectly still it is exhausted by its efforts and its muscles are so cramped that they feel quite hard to the touch this cramp soon passes off however and then at once the animal begins to grow it grows very fast indeed you can almost see it grow whole year increase in size has to take place in about hours then fresh crust is gradually formed upon the skin and two or three days later the animal is once more clad in coat of mail and is ready to leave its retreat and face its enemies whole twelvemonth after this it grows bigger but at the end of that time the process is repeated and so on year after year until at last the animal reaches its full size forms of c rust aceans the bodies of the crustacean animals are made up of number of rings or segments like those of the insects but there are always twenty of these rings instead of thirteen six forming the head while there are eight in the thorax and six in the hind body like the have feelers or antennæ upon their heads you can see these very well indeed in lobster or shrimp but instead of having one pair of these organs insects have they always possess two pairs and it is rather curious to ﬁnd that at the base of the front pair there are two little organs which seem to be ears specially formed hearing in the water while at the base of the second pair are two other little organs which seem to serve nose specially made smelling in the water more like the have to pass through several different forms before they reach the perfect state they are hatched in the ﬁrst place from eggs which the mother animal carries about with her some little time ﬁrmly fastened to the hairs of the swimmerets which we ﬁnd under the hind part of her body you will often ﬁnd shrimp with quite large bunch of these eggs and if you look at them carefully with good strong you will see that they are all glued down to hairs inside each of these eggs an odd little creature is formed which is called the nauplius sometimes it is hatched while still in that state and swims about through the water but in almost all the higher crustaceans change takes place before it leaves the egg and it appears at last in the form of zoëa this is kind of crustacean caterpillar and very odd little creature it is great naturalist once described it an animal with goggle eyes hawk beak scorpion tail rhinoceros horn and body fringed with legs yet hardly bigger than grain of sand certainly it does not look in the least like the crab or lobster or shrimp into which it is going by and by to turn and it swims in the oddest way possible by turning endless somersaults in the water these zoëas are sometimes found in immense shoals the surface of the sea being quite thick with them miles and they are useful little creatures they feed on the tiny scraps of decaying matter which are always ﬂoating about in the sea just tadpoles and in ponds thus helping to keep the water pure but very great number of them are devoured by whales when are hungry they swim 398 399 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https open mouths through shoal of these little creatures and then strain them out of the water by means of the whalebone fringe which hangs down from the upper jaw after time the zoëa throws off its skin and appears in quite different form it is now called megalopa or creature because it has very large eyes which are usually set on and project to quite long distance from the sides of the head and the zoëa is kind of crustacean caterpillar so the megalopa is kind of crustacean chrysalis it generally has long slender body made up of several joints and it swims by ﬂapping this to and fro in the water crabs first among the crustaceans come the crabs of which there are great many different kinds they are distinguished by having the tail tucked under the body and ﬁrmly soldered so to speak to the shell on either side you can ﬁnd several kinds of these creatures by hunting among the rocks on the shore when the tide is out there is the common example which is green in color it is generally to be found hiding under masses of growing seaweed but sometimes you may see it prowling about in search of prey it is wonderfully active and will even pounce upon the sandhoppers they go skipping about just spider will pounce upon ﬂies seldom or never missing its aim it will catch ﬂies too leaping upon them when they settle and shutting them up it were in kind of cage formed by its legs then it pokes one claw carefully into this cage seizes the prisoners pulls them to pieces and pokes the fragments into its mouth swimming about in the pools too you may often ﬁnd ﬁddler which is so called because its movements in the water rather remind one of man who is playing the violin you will ﬁnd that its hind legs are very much ﬂattened and are fringed with stiff hairs so that they may be used oars in fact the animal rows itself through the water both these crabs sad to say are canni bals and are always ready to attack and devour their own kind then there is the edible crab or blue crab which is common on many parts of our coasts the edible crab of europe is somewhat different you are not likely to meet with the larger examples which live in deeper water but even the smaller ones can give very sharp nip with their great claws and you will ﬁnd it well to be very careful in handling them the best plan is to seize them with the thumb and ﬁnger just behind these claws then they are perfectly harmless the larger crabs which sometimes weigh much twelve pounds are extremely powerful and in more than one case man has been killed by them having been seized by the wrist he was groping among the rocks and held in grip from which he could not break away until he was drowned by the rising tide these crabs are captured by means of made of basketwork which have the entrance so formed that while the crabs can easily enter they can not possibly get out again these pots are baited with pieces of fresh ﬁsh and are then weighted with stones and lowered to the bottom of the sea among the rocks at depth of from three to about twenty fathoms they are also caught on lines baited with meat hook is needed the crab clings to the meat till it reaches the surface of the water when it must be ﬂung into the boat or somehow captured quickly before it has time to let go and sink some crabs live on dry land sometimes at distance of two or three miles from the sea which they only visit at intervals among these are the famous found in many of the warmer parts of the world these crabs obtain their name from the fact that one of the great claws of the male is very much larger than the other so big is it indeed that it has to be held aloft over the body when the animal is running in order to prevent it from losing its balance and toppling over and soon the crab begins to move this huge claw is jerked up and down just if the creature were calling or beckoning to its companions the live in burrows in the sand which are often placed close to one another those in 400 401 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https rabs next we come to those small curious creatures known which form kind of connecting link between the crabs and the lobsters their tails instead of being ﬁrmly soldered down underneath their bodies are quite free but the odd thing about these animals is that their tails have shelly covering the front part of the body is protected by coat of mail just it is in all the other crabs but the hind part is quite bare and soft the consequence is that is always very nervous indeed about his tail he is dreadfully afraid that one of his many enemies may creep up behind and bite it when he is not looking so he always tucks it away in an empty shell like that of whelk or which he drags about with him wherever he goes you may often ﬁnd these curious crabs by hunting them in the pools among the rocks at low water the crab always sits just inside the entrance of the shell which he closes and guards with one of his great claws and if you try to pull him out you will ﬁnd that you are quite unable to so he has pair of strong pincers at the end of his body by which he holds the shell so ﬁrmly that you can tear him in two without forcing him to loose his grip sometimes you will ﬁnd that has fastened itself to the edge of shell in which is living this is great advantage to the crab while there are many ﬁshes which would be quite ready to crunch him up shell and all ﬁsh will ever meddle with so long the anemone remains on his shell he is perfectly safe and this plan is also great advantage to the anemone which is sure to get plenty of food without any trouble when the crab ﬁnds the dead body of some small creature and begins to pull it to pieces quantity of small fragments is sure to ﬂoat upward in the water and the anemone catches them with its spreading tentacles and feeds upon them the r obber rab one of the most extraordinary crustaceans is this which is found in many of the islands in the indian ocean it is like the in some ways but the tail is covered with shelly plates just like the rest of the body and instead of living in shells in the sea it lives in deep burrows on dry land but the oddest thing of all with regard to this crab is its food what you think it feeds upon cocoanuts that seems impossible does it one would imagine that the crab could never get the nuts open but it manages in this way first of all it pulls away the ﬁbers from that end of the nut at which the three eyeholes are situated with one of its stout claws it then hammers away at one of these till it breaks its way through and ﬁnally after allowing the milk to run away it pokes its hind claws which are very slender indeed through the opening and picks out the white ﬂeshy part of the nut little piece at time it is said too that this crab sometimes opens nut by poking the smaller joint of one of its claws into the hole and then striking it over and over again upon big stone the burrow of the robber is rather deep one and is nearly always situated beneath the roots of tree and at the end of the burrow is large chamber in which the crab piles up quantity of cocoanut ﬁber to serve bed lobsters of course you know the lobster very well by sight and perhaps you know that until it is boiled it is black not red but you know how it swims if so you know that it has two different ways of swimming when it is not in hurry it swims slowly forward by means of its swimmerets of which it has ﬁve pairs under the hinder part of its body but if it is startled or alarmed it swims swiftly backward by means of its tail if you look at lobster tail you will see that it is very broad and ﬂat and that on either side of it are two plates which are quite ﬂat and if anything are rather broader 402 403 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https when these are spread the tail looks like fan and the animal swims by ﬁrst stretching out its body almost straight and then doubling it suddenly with all its force it does so the tail and the spread out and act very much like broad oar and the result is that the lobster darts swiftly backward through the water shrimps and prawns swim in exactly the same way lobsters are very quarrelsome creatures and are constantly ﬁghting and it very often happens that in these battles they pull off one another limbs they seem to feel very little pain however from such an injury and before very long new legs begin to grow in place of the old ones so that in course of time the wounded creatures are perfect ever sometimes lobsters will throw off their limbs when they are not attacked at all they so example if they are suddenly frightened and it is said that if heavy gun is ﬁred near the surface of the water every lobster long way round will shed its great claws in alarm you will notice on looking at lobster that one of the great claws is good deal smaller than the other and sometimes people think that this is new claw which is growing in place of one that has been lost and that it has not yet reached its full size this however is mistake one of the claws is always much bigger than the other and the reason is that they are used different purposes the larger claw is intended weapon and with this the lobster ﬁghts but the smaller one is chieﬂy employed kind of anchor by means of which the animal can cling to the weeds or rocks at the bottom of the sea lobsters are caught in pots made of basketwork just crabs are but they are not nearly so dainty crabs and not mind whether the bait is fresh or putrid they are always very much attracted too by any object that glitters and many lobster has been lured to its death merely by one or two oyster hung up inside the pot in such manner to show the shining pearly interior crayfish the crayﬁsh is kind of lobster which is found commonly in many parts of the world and numerously in the central and southern parts of the united states most species hide all day long under the proje cting edges of big stones or in holes in the bank only coming out after nightfall to search food the british crayﬁsh is said to be particularly fond of the deserted burrow of water and it sits inside it always guards the entrance with its great claws striking ﬁercely at any enemy which may be bold enough to come within reach one at least of the american kinds sinks its own burrows in the form of round holes in the soil of damp meadows these holes go down to water which the anim al can not live long away from and part of the soil dug out is piled about the mouth of the hole in little tower or chimney sometimes several inches high in europe crayﬁsh are eaten and regarded delicacy when properly cooked and there is reason why the american ones should not be equally good but they are rarely if ever used food by us the ﬂesh tastes like that of the lobster but is more tender shrimps and p rawns these are really only tiny lobsters and if you examine them carefully you will ﬁnd that their bodies are made in exactly the same way they swim too by means of their tails and dart about so swiftly that it is almost impossible to follow their movements you may often ﬁnd them in numbers in the pools which are left among the rocks by the retreating tide but they are almost colorless until they are boiled it is very difﬁcult to see them and they look just like shadows darting to and fro in the water you can easily tell prawn from shrimp the beak which projects in front of its head is covered with sharp points which are almost exactly like the teeth of saw it feeds upon the bodies of the various small creatures which die by millions every day in this way it helps to keep the water of the sea pure it feeds in curious way tearing off 404 405 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https scraps of ﬂesh with the little pincers at the tips of the second pair of legs and poking them into its mouth one after another the sides of these limbs are covered with hairs so that they form little brushes and with these the prawn carefully cleans its body and limbs rubbing of f every little speck of dirt which may happen to cling to them sandhoppers you can hardly walk along sand shore when the tide is rising without seeing sandhoppers leaping and twisting about in thousands if you turn over bunch of seaweed which has been ﬂung up by the waves just above mark you are almost sure to ﬁnd forty or ﬁfty of these odd little creatures hiding under it in some ways they are rather like shrimps but they differ from them in having their eyes set on the head itself instead of on little projecting from it and they have carapace or shelly shield covering the middle part of the body how these creatures hop by ﬁrst doubling up their bodies and then straightening them out again with kind of jerk it is exactly opposite in fact to the way in which shrimps and lobsters swim sandhoppers not follow the retreating tide but bury themselves in the sand very soon after the waves have ceased to break over them even when the surface of the sand is quite dry you can ﬁnd their burrows by stamping with your foot when number of little round holes will suddenly open all round you these creatures have wonderfully sharp little teeth and if you allowed swarm of them to rest little while on your handkerchief you would most likely ﬁnd that it was full of tiny holes when you took it up they will eat almost anything either animal or vegetable and are quite useful the shrimps and prawns in helping to keep the water pure but they have great many enemies crabs and all sorts of other creatures destroy them literally in millions the f resh water s hrimp this shrimp is very much like the sandhopper in some ways you may ﬁnd it in numbers in almost any small stream or rivulet it hides under stones or in little crevices in the bank darting out now and then to seize one of the tiny creatures upon which it feeds and then hurrying back with it to its retreat when it is in the water it travels along by series of jerks sometimes swimming with its back uppermost and sometimes on one side but if it is placed on dry ground it is perfectly helpless its legs are not nearly strong enough to carry it and the only result of its struggles is to turn it round and round in manner without forcing it forward at all woodlice these odd little creatures are really crustaceans although they belong to quite different group from that about which you have just been reading they simply swarm in all damp places under logs in heaps of decaying leaves and under the bark of dead trees they are always extremely plentiful and you may also ﬁnd them in hundreds in cellars and outhouses there are several different kinds one of which rolls itself up into ball when it is touched or alarmed this is called the or another one is remarkable the fact that the mother carries her little ones about with her in pouch underneath her body some little time after they are born barnacles you would hardly think that barnacles were crustaceans would you yet they are though certainly they are very unlike any of those about which we have been telling you can ﬁnd them in countless thousands upon the rocks which are left bare by the tide at low water and very often the hulls of ships are so covered with them that the vessels have to be taken into dry dock and thoroughly cleaned before they are ﬁt to start upon voyage 406 407 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https animals fasten themselves down to their hold by kind of which is ﬁrmly attached by very strong cement the upper part of the body becomes covered with shell consisting of several pieces or valves and between these six odd little limbs can be poked out at will these limbs are very hairy and are always waving about so to sweep into the mouth any tiny scraps of food which may be ﬂoating in the water there are great many kinds of barnacles some of which look very much like acorns and grow to considerable size these are known and there is another shaped rather like piece of round tube which burrows into the skin of whales in which it spends all the remainder of its life sometimes it bores its way down so far that it actually reaches the blubber the young of these strange creatures pass through several transformations just like those of the lobster and the crab first there is nauplius then zoëa and then megalopa all of which swim freely about in the water never fastening themselves down until they are ready to pass into the perfect form life on the om sticklebacks carp 3 5 6 13 shrimps prawn fiddler crab starﬁsh horses 1 edible mussels serpula worm crab in whelk shell rock crab polyzoan flustra corallines gor gonia chapter xxxvi st arfishes and next in order to the crustaceans comes group of animals which live in the sea and which are known echinoderms whic h simply means this group includes the the starﬁshes and the rchins you can ﬁnd good many of these creatures when you go to the seaside by hunting about on the beach at low water in some places on rocky coasts are very common sometimes they are known and in many countries they are actually boiled and eaten food just we eat the eggs of fowls and ducks and their shells are 408 409 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https thickly covered with spines that they look just like little hedgehogs which have rolled themselves up into balls when the animal is alive it can move these spines at will each of them being fastened to the shell by joint just like those which we described to you when we were telling about the vertebræ of the snakes but after it has been dead few days they are nearly always knocked off by the action of the waves so that the shell is left quite smooth and bare by means of these spines can bury itself in the sand at the bottom of the sea in very short time only just little pit being left to show where it is hiding and in some of the larger kinds they are really formidable weapons they grow to length of eight or ten inches and are so sharp and strong that they can actually pierce the sole of stout shoe besides this they have connected with them so that they can easily inﬂict really serious wound in the shell of are number of little holes through which the animal pokes out most curious sucker feet when it wants to climb about over the rocks by means of the suckers on the upper part of the shell it often clings to small stones which it sometimes gathers up in such numbers to conceal itself entirely from sight just inside the mouth of the urchin are ﬁve very large teeth these are formed just like the front teeth of the rodent animals and grow fast they are worn away are not numerous on the atlantic shores of north america because these shores are not rocky except in the cold north one small ﬂat kind however occurs in the deep waters off this coast and its cases are often cast up on the beaches and are called on the paciﬁc coast however are common and well known and the indians of the northwest coast boil them and eat them greedily starfishes more plentiful on both coasts and extremely numerous and harmful in all the bays and sounds from florida to maine are the starﬁshes or ﬁveﬁngers the oystermen call them but although they are so abundant very few people seem to know what curious creatures they are the starﬁsh has hundreds of little sucker feet just like those of the you can not see these rule becaus the starﬁsh keeps them tucked away inside its skin but when it wants to use them it can poke them out in moment if you want to look at these odd little feet the best way to so is to take live starﬁsh put it at the bottom of pool of and then wait patiently ten minutes or quarter of an hour by the end of that time you are almost sure to see that the animal is slowly moving then snatch it out of the water turn it upside down and you will see hundreds of little white objects waving about on the lower surface of its body these are its feet and if you look at them through good strong you will see that they are shaped just like each having kind of ﬂeshy cup at the end of slender stem and at the end of the cup is the sucker in the very middle of the lower part of the body of starﬁsh is its mouth this is generally rather large the animal feeds chieﬂy on animals which it swallows whole shells and all then when it has digested the bodies of its victims it turns their empty shells out again through its mouth that is an odd way of feeding is it but sometimes it feeds in an odder way still when it ﬁnds creature which is too big to be swallowed it will actually turn its own digestive organs out of its mouth wrap them round its victim hold them there until it is digested and then drag them in again and go of f to look another victim starﬁshes eat great many oysters in this way so many they destroy indeed that they are the very worst foes with which oyster have to deal and the damage done by them in one single oyster on the coast of north america is estimated at less than ﬁfty thousand dollars every year 410 411 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https are great many different kinds of starﬁshes one example has twelve rays instead of ﬁve and looks very much like live sunﬂower this is called the another has its ﬁve rays all joined together by webbing very much like the toes on duck foot and is known the star it is very handsome creature while the greater part of its body is bright yellow it has broad band of crimson running all the way round the outer margin and another stripe of the same color down the outer edges of each ray while the membrane between them is fringed with yellow hairs but you are not very likely to ﬁnd it it lives in rathe r deep water and is hardly ever caught except by means of that useful net which is called dredge odder by far than any of these however are the which owe their name to their extraordinary habit of breaking themselves to pieces they nearly always this if they are touched or alarmed in fact they are so ready to so that it is very difﬁcult indeed to obtain perfect museum the creature just gives kind of shudder and its ﬁve rays all drop off and break up into little pieces all that is left of the animal being just the central disk but it does not appear to suffer any pain and loses hardly any blood and before very long new rays grow in the place of the old ones so that in few weeks time the starﬁsh is just perfect ever the have ﬁve very long and very slender rays which are generally fringed on either side with yellow hairs and these rays are hardly ever still but twist and writhe and curl about so actively that they really look almost like so many centipedes it is by means so numerous the ﬁveﬁnger and is so easily broken that it is hard to ﬁnd whole one on the beach very curious too is the which at ﬁrst sight does not look like starﬁsh at all the reason is that close to its body each of the ﬁve rays divides into two then each of the branches divides into two again and each of those into two more and so on over and over again till sometimes there are more than eighty thousand little arms altogether the catches its prey by means of these wonderful rays which it wraps all round it in the form of circular basket it is not at all common creature and is only found in deep water but perhaps the oddest of all these creatures is the rosy feather which actually grows on stalk while it is young and looks just like ﬂower with its petals spread the stalk which is fastened down to rock at the bottom of the sea is made up of great number of tiny joints and grows longer and longer and when it reaches its full length the animal breaks itself free and swims away leaving the stem behind the rosy feather lives in rather deep water from which it is sometimes brought up by means of the dredge it can crawl about on the ground by means of its sucker feet and can swim through the water with some little speed and very often to save itself trouble it will cling by means of its rays to piece of ﬂoating wood and allow itself to be carried long distances by the waves in great britain these may often be found near shore but the american feather all live in very deep water they are all that remain of large class of such anim als which abounded in the very ancient seas whose fossil remains are called ucumbers these are really relations of the starﬁshes although they not look in the least like them they closely resemble the vegetable after which they are named in front of the slit at one end of the body however which serves mouth there is feathery tuft this consists of delicate little tentacles or feelers by means of which the animal ﬁshes its food and which can be drawn back inside the body when it is not hungry and if it were not this tuft one really might almost mistake the animal cucumber we saw just now that the breaks off its own rays at the slightest alarm but the in this way is even odder still if it eats anything which disagrees with it it sometimes does it turns all its digestive organs out of its mouth cuts them off and allows them to ﬂoat away then three or four months it is very little else than 412 413 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https bag of empty skin with just slit at one end and tuft in front of it but at the end of that time new digestive organs begin to grow in the place of the old ones and very soon the is perfect ever is that remarkable way of curing indigestion some of the grow to very great size one indeed when fully grown is nearly six feet long and in china they are largely used food under the name of trepang and are looked upon great dainty chapter xxxvii mollusks the class of the mollusks is very large one at least ﬁfty thousand different kinds of these creatures are already known while new ones are constantly being discovered they may be described boneless animals which are enclosed in tough muscular skin called the mantle and they are divided into ﬁve orders the ﬁrst of which includes the singular creatures known squids or cuttles you may sometimes ﬁnd these animals hiding in the pools which are left amon g the rocks when the tide goes out and you can recognize them at once by the long ﬂeshy tentacles or arms which spring from the upper part of the head some of them have ten of these arms and are called decapods the rest have only eight and are known octopods and the lower surface of each arm is furnished with row of circular suckers the grip of which is so powerful that the tentacle may even be torn in two without causing it to release its hold indeed if quite small cuttle were to seize you with one of its arms you would not ﬁnd it at all easy to make it let go again without killing it the cuttles employ these suckers two purposes in the ﬁrst place they use them in walking when cuttle is crawling along at the bottom of the sea it pushes one or two tentacles forward takes ﬁrm hold of rock or large stone with the suckers underneath them pulls up the body and then thrus ts them forward again and in the second place they use them in catching their prey quite large victims are often seized by cuttles and when once the deadly suckers have fastened upon them there is hope of escape in spite of their struggles one tentacle after another comes closing in till they are completely surrounded by the long slimy arms soft almost jelly yet strong steel then they are pushed down against the sharp strong beak by which they are quickly torn in pieces on the upper part of the head of the cuttle there is another curious organ known the siphon which consists of two tubes lying side by side together like the barrels of gun this or gan is used in three dif ferent ways first it is used in breathing the cuttles like the ﬁshes breathe water by means of gills these gills lie inside the head and the water passes down to them through one of the and then out again through the other next it is used in swimming when cuttles are not in hurry they crawl along by means of their long tentacles we told you just now but if they are startled or alarmed in any way they fold all their tentacles together in straight line ﬁll both the tubes with water and then squirt it out again hard they possibly can the result is of course that they are driven rapidly backward by the recoil just like the dragon ﬂy grub of which we have read but the third use of the is the most curious if you discover small cuttle hiding in you will very likely ﬁnd that the water all round it suddenly grows dark night just if quantity of ink had been poured into it the fact is this inside its body the cuttle has bag ﬁlled with quantity of liquid called 414 415 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https this bag is surrounded by strong bands of muscle and opens into the so you see when the animal suddenly contracts the muscular bands the sepia is squirted out through the siphon into the water which is immediately darkened some little distance all round and under cover of the darkness the animal escapes the eggs of the cuttle are laid in very curious way they are fastened by little stalks to stem of seaweed so that they look very much like bunch of grapes fishermen indeed nearly always speak of them the cuttles which are found in the british seas are always quite small but in some parts of the ocean these creatures grow to giant size fragments of the tentacles of an enormous cuttle instance have been found lying on the coast of newfoundland and by careful calculation it was shown that if the animal to which they belonged had stretched them out at right angles to its body they would actually have measured more than eighty feet from tip to tip these huge creatures seem to form the principal food of the the c hambered n autilus this animal is near relation of the cuttles it lives in shell which can not increase in size the mollusk itself grows however and soon becomes too big to live in its home so it forms second and larger compar tment outside the ﬁrst one time after time this happens till at last the shell consists of about chambers only the outside one being inhabited by the nautilus this shell is often more than foot in diameter but if you were to see it when it is ﬁrst taken out of the sea you would never think that it was shell at all indee d it looks much more like big shapeless lump of blubber the animal covers it entirely with its muscular mantle so that the shell itself is completely concealed very little is known of the habits of the chambered nautilus it lives at the bottom of the sea at depth of two or three hundred fathoms it is found in various parts of the indian and paciﬁc oceans gastropods great many creatures belong to this large group ﬁrst upon the list being the slugs we need not describe these animals but perhaps you will be surprised to hear that they have shells these shells are very small however and are entirel y covered over by the mantle so that they can not be seen unless the body is dissected slugs have the most wonderful power of stretching out and drawing up their bodies you may see one of these creatures crawling about on damp evening and measuring fully ﬁve inches in length but at the slightest touch it begins to contract and in few seconds it is just shapeless lump scarcely half long it was before the odd little tentacles are drawn back into the head and the head is drawn back into the body so that if you did not happen to know what it was you might easily mistake it pebble on the side of slug body it crawls along you will notice rather large and almost round hole this is the entrance to the gans which lie just behind the head and underneath the mantle during the daytime slugs remain in hiding lying behind the loose bark of dead trees or under logs and large stones or in heaps of decaying leaves and if the weather is very hot and dry they not come out even at night they very soon die if they are deprived of moisture but on warm damp evenings they travel long distances in search of food which is almost entirely of vegetable character in europe every gardener knows what injury they to gardens there but in america the slugs are practically harmless good many different kinds of slugs are found in great britain the largest of all is the great gray slug which often grows to length of more than six inches then the black slug is very common in many parts of the country it is not always black however one may often ﬁnd examples which are brown or yellow or gray or even white the 416 417 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https slug which has thick creamy slime is plentiful everywhere and sometimes one may dig up very curious feeds on earthworms and follows them down to the very bottom of their burrows when the weather is cold this slug makes kind of cocoon of earth and slime and lies fast asleep inside it often many months at time snails in many ways snails are very much like slugs but they have shell large enough to contain the entire body when the animal withdraws inside it several hundred different kinds of snails are found in north america and many more in other parts of the world varying in size from that of small pinhead to that of big walnut some are exceedingly numerous others so rare and singular in their that they are highly prized by conchologists all snails lay eggs usually in damp soil and if you will turn over an old log in the woods in summer you will be almost certain to ﬁnd some of the minute shining globules when winter draws near all the snails go into hiding and they have most curious way of closing the entrances to their shells by making little doors across them composed partly of slime and partly of very small fragments of earth this is in order to prevent the frosty air from getting in and killing them but it would never of course to keep all the air out in that case they would be unable to breathe so they always leave tiny hole in the middle of each door through which just enough air can pass to prevent them from being suf focated among the largest of all is the edible snail which is largely used food in many parts of europe and is imported into the united states and pickled to be eaten by those who like this delicacy most of the gastropod mollusks howev er live in the water some inhabiting ponds and streams while others dwell in the sea in almost every brook and every ditch example you may ﬁnd water of different kinds some are quite ﬂat and some are conical and pointed some are large and some are so tiny that they are almost always overlooked most of them feed upon decaying leaves and they have an odd way of traveling by ﬂoatin g upside down at the surface of the water each with its broad ﬂeshy foot expanded so to convert themselves into tiny boats you may sometimes see quite ﬂeet of these little creatures being carried along by the stream but if you throw stone into the water they all sink down to the bottom at once and not resume their journey until many hours or even days afterward the eggs of this snail are laid in long ribbons which are generally fastened either to the stems and leaves of water or under the edges of large stones lying at the bottom of the stream very large number of gastropods live in the sea one of the best known of these is the whelk of which one reads in all books of english natural history on almost every sandy and shingly beach in western europe one may ﬁnd it lying about in hundreds and even in large inland towns one often sees whelks sale both in ﬁshmongers shops and on barrows at the corners of the streets its eggs are one of the curiosities of the objects about the size of peas made of tough skin and fastened together in bundles about big you may often ﬁnd these bundles on the shore in dozens and most likely you will wonder how the whelk ever managed to lay batch of eggs good deal bigger than itself but the fact is that the eggs of the whelk are just like those of the frog when they are ﬁrst laid they are very tiny but the tough skin of which they are made is very elastic so that it will stretch almost like piece of besides this it has the curious property of allowing water to soak in from the outside but not to pass out again so soon the eggs are dropped into the sea they begin to swell and before very long they are quite twenty or thirty times lar ge they were when they were ﬁrst laid we not have these whelks in north america but we have variety of small gastropods whose shells are sometimes rough and coiled in spiral form sometimes round like and of various sizes one of them is the purpura which has many 418 419 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https and broad dark and light stripes running spirally the purpura of the mediterranean is famous the purple dye obtained from its body but our species yields such dye also in small quantity this was the dye anciently known tyrian purple it is contained in little bag behind the throat which holds just one small drop of liquid and more and if you were to see it you would never think that it was dye at all it looks only like rather yellowish water but if it is squeezed out on sheet of white paper and laid in the sunshine it very soon begins to change color first it becomes green then blue and then purple and it is really the dye which the ancient romans valued so highly that one who did not belong to the royal family was allowed to dress in purple raiment borers in many parts of our eastern coast occur in great numbers two or three kinds of small rough spiral gastropods called borers by the ﬁshermen who hate them because of the great number of oysters they kill each of these spends its whole life in seeking and devouring other mollusks it kills and eats these in very curious way like all the gastropods it possesses what we call is narrow strip of very tough gristle in its mouth set with row upon row of sharp notched ﬂinty teeth there are some times more than six thousand of these teeth and although they are so small that they can not be seen without the aid of powerful microscope they are nevertheless very formidable every tooth is hooked with the points of the hook directed toward the throat the is used in this way when borer meets with victim it fastens itself to it by means of its ﬂeshy muscular foot then it bores round hole through its shell neatly if it had been pierced by drill and then it pokes the down into the body of the creature inside and draws it back again it does so of course the hooked teeth tear away little bits of the victim ﬂesh the borer swallows these and then pokes down its once more and so it goes on over and over again until the shell of its victim has been completely emptied when it goes off to look another periwinkles these are common on rocky parts of the coast and you may ﬁnd them crawling about on the rocks in thousands when the tide is out they have just like that of the borer but they not use them in the same way they feed only upon seaweeds and they are remarkable having the foot divided by kind of groove which runs right down the middle when periwinkle crawls it moves ﬁrst one side of this foot forward and then the other side so that although it has legs it may really almost be said to walk the c owr y one of the prettiest of the gastropod shells is that of the cowry in some parts of africa used money it would seem strange to earn one living just by picking up money on the would it and perhaps you might think that every one who lived near those parts of the coast where cowries are found must be very well off but then sixteen hundred of these shells are only worth about quarter of dollar so that you would have to hunt very long while and stoop great many times in order to obtain sufﬁcient even to buy food and it must be very awkward to have to carry several sacks of money when one goes out marketing many of them however are extremely beautiful limpets commoner still are the limpets which you may ﬁnd in thousands clinging to the rocks that are left bare when the tide goes out they fasten themselves down by means of 420 421 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https broad ﬂeshy foot which acts big sucker and so ﬁrmly they hold that it is almost impossible to pull them away after time the edges of limpet shell cut circular groove in the rock to which it clings so that even the can not drive their beaks underneath and force it from its hold and though when the tide is up the mollusk will wander to distance of two or even three feet in search of food it always seems to return to its before the retreating waves again leave the rock uncovered amphineurans this order of mollusks contains the curious creatures which are known chitons these may be described llos they are covered with kind of shelly armor consisting of series of plates and can roll themselves up into balls in order to protect themselves from the attacks of their enemies one of these mollusks is called the prickly chiton because it is covered all over with sharp spines like hedgehog it grows to length of nearly six inches but long before it reaches its full size the spines are rubbe d off so that large example of this creature is nearly always perfectly bare the chito ns live among muddy rocks at mark and are not common outside the tropics or in shallow water the order of the amphineurans is quite small one and so is that of the scaphopods which consists only of the which are very common on the sandy coasts of the northern paciﬁc and look rather like very tiny elephants tusks the indians of the puget sound region used to string them ornaments and valued them highly bivalves the order of the bivalves is very large and important one all these creatures have their shells made of two parts or valves which are fastened together by means of hinge they have heads and the mantle forms kind of ﬂap on either side of the body they are found both in fresh and salt water every one knows the clams or mussels which abound in our lakes and rivers in the central and southern parts of the united states they are exceedingly numerous and of many kinds some rough others smooth all are lined with mother and pretty buttons and other ornaments are made from them moreover pearls are very frequently discovered inside their shells and sometimes they are of great value the p earl yster pearls are obtained chieﬂy however from the which is found in warm seas in many parts of the world the principal ﬁsheries being in ceylon the persian gulf the south sea islands and off the north east coast of australia they are deposited by the mantle and it is most likely that they are really due to grain of sand which has lodged inside the shell and set up irritation indeed it has been found that if small objects such tiny stones are forced between the valves of one of these oysters they become covered with layers of pearl in very short time the best mother is also obtained from the shells of the oysters the ordinary oyster belongs to another family of bivalves in which one part of the shell is good deal lar ger than the other the early life of this mollusk is very curious the spawn is known spat and is produced in enormous quantities this spat looks at ﬁrst like very ﬁne gray dust and remains some little time within the shells of the parent but one day in early summer the oyster opens its valves little way and squirts it out like cloud into the water few weeks the little oysters are able to swim and they generally travel back ward and forward with the tide but after while they attach themselves to some object at the 422 423 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of the water and there they remain without moving any more the rest of their lives one would think that since family of oysters is so enormously large these creatures must be the most plentiful mollusks in the sea but by far the larger number are destroyed by other creatures before they are able to settle down while even after that they have great many enemies we have already told you how mischievous starﬁshes are in the oyster then borers and are almost equally troublesome and besides these there is curious kind of sponge called the cliona which burrows into the shells of the mollusk and gradually destroys them sometimes actually causing them to fall to pieces black m ussels two or three kinds of black mussels live in vast numbers on almost all coasts clinging to rocks and submer ged timber the way in which mussel fastens itself to its hold is very curious instead of turni ng the whole of the foot into big sucker the limpet does it spins number of very strong threads from that part which lies nearest to the hinge and every one of these threads is separately fastened to the support so that the creature is moored down it were by kind of cable these threads are known the byssus and hold so ﬁrmly that it is not at all easy to pull them away some of these mussels are good to eat but are not much used in the united states in europe the c ockle this is another very bivalv its shells covered with low ridges you must know by sight it is one of the burrowing mollusks spending its life buried in sandy mud it is especially common at the mouths of large rivers where enormous quantities are collected to serve human food and its large muscular foot is not only used in digging but also enabl es it to leap to considerable height it is to this family that the quahog or hard clam of our markets belongs razor shells these too are inhabitants of the mud and if you want to ﬁnd their burrows all that you have to is to visit patch of sandy mud when the tide is out and stand quietly watching it before long you are sure to see little jet of water spurt out of the mud to height of three or four inches now this water has been squirted out of the of razor and if you walk to the spot treading very carefully you will ﬁnd tiny hole in the mud this is the entrance to the burrow and if you want to get the animal out the best way to so is to drop little salt down the hole it is very strange fact that although the razor can not live in mud at the bottom of fresh water it does not like pure salt at all and is sure to come up to the surface and try to get rid of it but if you fail to seize it at once it will retreat to the very bottom of its burrow and amount of salt will persuade it to come up again the soft clam which is sold in our markets in such enormous quantities is near relative of the razor the p iddock one of the most wonderful of all the bivalves is the piddock it is boring mollusk living buried in the solid chalk or limes tone if you should examine the rocks which are left bare at low water along the shore of the mediterranean or some other warm sea you would often ﬁnd that they are pierced by numbers of rather large round holes these are the entrances to the burrows of piddocks and if you could split the rock open you would ﬁnd several of these creatures lying in their tunnels sometimes when they are boring their burrows become choked up behind them with the material which they have scraped away then they just squirt out jet of water from their and so wash the passage clear 424 425 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https is really owing to the work of the piddocks that chalk and limestone cliffs are so much cut away by the sea the waves by themselves can very little in this way when they wash up against the face of the cliff they leave the spores of seaweeds behind them and these very soon grow and cover the whole surface with mantle of living green which almost entirely prevents the cliff from being worn away but the piddocks drive their burrows into the rock just below the surface of the water boring back ward and forward till it is completely honeycombed by their tunnels which only have just the thinnest of walls left between them then the sea washes into the burrows and breaks these walls down so that the whole foundation of the cliff is cut away very soon of course there is landslip and hundreds of tons of chalk or limestone the case may be come falling down then the piddocks begin working again little farther back and the process is repeated and so on over and over again on many parts of the south coast of england long stretches of rocks run ever so far out into the sea and are only partly left bare at low water those rocks were once the bases of cliffs which the piddocks and the waves together have cut away and it even seems almost certain that the strait of dover was cut in this manner and that if it had not been the labors of the piddocks carried on day after day thousa nds upon thousands of years great britain even now would not be an island but would still form part of the continent of europe we know that it did in ages long gone by the t eredo there is bivalve mollusk which burrows into submer ged timber such the hulls of wooden ships or the beams of piers and jetties this is called the teredo or and certainly it does look much more like worm than mollusk it has cylinder shaped body something like foot in length with forked tail while the shell only covers just little part at one end how it burrows into the wood nobody quite knows it is generally supposed to so by means of the foot but in very short time it will honeycomb great beam of timber with its burrows which it always lines with kind of shelly deposit weakening it to such degree that at last it gives way beneath the slightest pressure like great many other mollusks the teredo passes through kind of caterpillar stage before it reaches its perfect form while it is in this condition it is able to swim freely about in the water and looks rather like very tiny hedgehog being almost globular in shape and covered all over with short projecting hairs it is by means of the action of these hairs upon the water that it is able to swim chapter xxxviii annelids and cœlentera tes the important class of the annelids contains those creatures which we generall y call worms there are great many of these but we shall only be able to mention one or two the c ommon arthworm this worm is really most interesting well most useful animal the way in which it crawls is decidedly curious on the lower part of every one of the rings of which its body is made up with the sole exception of the head are four pairs of short stiff little bristles projecting outward from the skin the worm really hitches itself along by means of these bristles first it takes hold of the ground with those underneath the front rings then it draws up its body and takes hold with those underneath the hind ones and then it pushes its head forward and repeats the process and so on over and over again 426 427 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https you take worm and pass it between your ﬁnger and thumb from the toward the head you can feel these little bristles quite easily worm does not often leave its burrow however but generally keeps the tip of its body just inside the entrance so that it can retreat in moment in case of danger worms make their burrows in very odd manner they actually eat their way down into the ground swallowing mout hful after mouthful of earth until their bodies can contain more meanwhile they have been absorbing nourishment from this soil but presently they come up to the surface and pour out the mold which they have swallowed in the form of what we call after which they go down again and swallow more and so on until the burrow is sufﬁciently deep you will be surprised we think to hear how much earth is swallowed by the worms in this way just think of it every year in every acre of agricultural land all over the country worms bring up from below on an average and spread over the surfa ce in the form of less than fourteen tons of earth or about seven lar ge cartloads this is why worms are such useful creatures they are always it were digging and plowing the soil after time the earth at the surface becomes exhausted near ly all the nourishment is sucked out of it by the roots of the plants but the worms are always bringing up fresh rich unused soil from below and spreading it over the surfa ce in the form of what farmers call they are doing in fact exactly what we when we dig our gardens or plow our the soil that it may rest and bringing up fresh mold to take its place but besides turning the soil over they manure it almost every night from early spring to late autumn worms are busy dragging down leaves into their burrows with some of these leaves they line their tunnels with some they close the entrances and on some they feed and most of them decay before very long and turn into ld which is just about the very best manure that there is so you see the worms not merely turn the soil over they enrich it well and help very largely indeed to keep it in such condition that plants can continue to grow in it the l ugworm the similar lugworm lives in sandy mud on the and when the tide is out you may often see its casts in thousands it is very largely used by ﬁshermen bait when it is carefully washed it is really quite handsome creature sometimes it is deep crimson in color and sometimes dark green while on its back are twenty little scarlet tufts arranged in pairs which are really the gills by which the worm breathes the burrows of the lugworm are not quite like those of the earthworm its tunnels through the sand it pours out kind of liquid which very soon hardens and lines the walls so to form kind of tube and prevent the sides from falling in the t erebella this worm forms very much stronger tubes it is common on many parts of our coasts but it is not very easily found at the slightest alarm it retreats to the very bottom of its burrow which nearly always runs under lar ge stones and rocks the terebella makes its tube by means of the little feelers or tentacles which spring from the front part of its body these have most wonderful power of grasp and one after another little grains of sand are seized by them and carefully arranged in position and when the tube is quite ﬁnished the animal constructs little tuft of sandy threads so to speak round the entrance which you may often see in the pools left among the rocks by the retreating tide the s ea ouse looking far more like hairy slug than worm the also belongs to the class of the annelids you can easily ﬁnd this creature by hunting in muddy pools among the rocks just above mark and most likely you will consider it one of the 428 429 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https and most animals that you have ever seen but if you rinse it two or three times over in clean water till every atom of mud has been washed out of its bristly coat you may change your opinion now you will see all the colors of the rainbow playing over purple orange blue and vivid if every hair were prism it would be difﬁcult indeed to ﬁnd any creature more beautiful in the waters of the sea this bristly coat is really kind of ﬁlter which strains out the mud from the water that passes to the gills leeches leeches too are annelids living in fresh water instead of salt water they are famous their habits and when we examine their mouths through microscope we ﬁnd that they are provided with three sets of very small teeth which are set in the form of triangle when leech wants to suck the blood of an animal it fastens itself to the skin of its victim by means of its sucker lips and then saws out tiny triangular piece of skin that is why it is so difﬁcult to stop the bleeding after leech has bitten one an actual hole is left in the skin which does not heal over some little time and great deal of blood is generally taken by the leech itself which will go on sucking away until its body is stretched out to at least double its former size that is rather big meal to take is it but then such meals come very seldom indeed when leech has once gorged itself thoroughly with blood it will often take more food at all whole year afterward leeches lay their eggs in little masses called cocoons which they place in the banks of the pools in which they live in each of these cocoons there are from six to sixteen eggs we now come to the last great class of animals about which we shall be able to tell of the cœlenterates it contains three most interesting groups of creatures jellyfishes you may have seen plenty of jellyﬁshes if at any time you have been staying at the seaside they are often ﬂung up on the beach by the retreating tide but if you were to go and look them two or three hours after seeing them on bright sunny day you would ﬁnd that they had disappeared all that would be left of them would be number of marks in the sand with just few threads of animal matter in the middle of each the reason would be that they had evaporated that sounds rather strange does it but the fact is that the greater part of the body of jellyﬁsh is nothing but water it is quite true that if you cut it in half the water does not run away but then that is equally true of cucumber and cucumbers too are made almost entirely of water the reason is the same in both cases the water is contained in very large number of tiny cells and when you cut either the animal or the vegetable across only few of these cells are divided and only small quantity of the water escapes round the edge of the disk of jellyﬁsh which has just been ﬂung up by the waves you will ﬁnd number of long slender threads these are its with which it captures its prey and they are made in very curious manner all the way along they are set with double row of very tiny cells in each of which is coiled up an extremely sharp and slender dart these cells are so formed that at the very slightest touch they ﬂy open and the little darts spring out and besides this the darts are poisoned so soon any small creature swims up against these threads number of the venomed darts bury themselves in its body and the poison acts so quickly that in very few seconds it is dead then other threads come closing in all round it and in very short time it is forced into the mouth and swallowed some jellyﬁshes are so poisonous that they are most dangerous even to man only one of these however is found in the north atlantic almost all the jellyﬁshes that one ﬁnds lying about on the beach being perfectly harmless but if when you are bathing you see jellyﬁsh about big swimming near you in the water be sure to get out of its way fast you possibly can if its threads should 430 431 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https any part of your body you are almost sure to be very badly stung there is very little doubt indeed that many swimmers have been killed by these creatur es while thousands of unwary bathers have been laid up days or even weeks from the effects of their poison nemones what beautiful creatures are like ﬂowers growing under the sea some are like dahlias some like chrysanthemums and some like daisies of all shades of crimson and purple and orange and green and it is very hard to believe that they are really living animals the tentacles of these creatures which look so like the petals of ﬂowers are set with little cells containing poisoned darts just like the of the jellyﬁs hes they can be spread out or drawn back into the body at will and when they have all been withdrawn the anemone seems to be nothing more than shapeless lump of colored jelly anemones spend the greater part of their lives clinging to the surface of rock at the bottom of the water the broad base of the body acting just like big sucker they can crawl about however at will and sometimes they will rise to the surface of the sea turn upside down hollow their bodies into the form of little boats and then ﬂoat away perhaps quite long distance but few are seen on our eastern coast because except in the cool north there are few rocks on the warmer and rockier shores of california and northward however these lovely creatures occur in great variety corals last upon our list come those most wonderful little creatures which are known corals these are often called coral insects but that is great mistake they have nothing to with insects at all and are different from them in every way they can possibly be they are properly called polyps and we can best describe them perhaps very small but they have one property which the anemones not possess namely the power of extracting lime out of the and building it up round themselves in the form of coral these creatures may be roughly divided into two groups the one consisting of the simple corals which only live together in very small numbers and the other of the builders which live in vast colonies and build up masses of coral of enormous size the latter are by far the more interesting and the way in which they build up immense banks of coral is very wonderful indeed remember ﬁrst of all that these animals multiply in two different by eggs and sometimes by little buds so to speak which grow out of the body of the parent the polyps which hatch out from eggs swim about some little time quite freely but after few days they fasten themselves down to the surface of submer ged rock and after that they never move again other polyps soon come and settle down by them and before very long there will be thousands upon thousands of the little animals all growing it were close together and all gradually building up coral underneath and round the mar gins of their bodies when they reach their full size they begin to multiply by budding baby polyps sprout out all over their bodies and these instead of swimming about few days like those which are hatched from eggs remain ﬁxed where they are the whole of their lives then they in their turn begin to deposit coral and they have nowhere else to put it they place it on the bodies of their parents which before very long are completely covered in now you see there is second layer of coral on the top of the ﬁrst then in due course of time third layer is formed upon the second and fourth layer upon the third each generation being built in by the one that comes after it till at last the coral bank rises above the surface of the water then the work has to stop these little creatures can not live unless the waves can constantly break over them but although the 432 433 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https can not be raised higher it can still be extended on all sides and so the little polyps go working on year after year till at last the results of their labor are almost too wonderful to realize coral b anks these coral banks take three dif ferent forms first there are the fringing reefs these are great banks of coral surrounding the shores of tropical island or running long distances on the coasts of the mainland the island of mauritius example is entirely surrounded by fringing reef these reefs often spread out miles into the sea and they are only broken here and there by narrow passages where some river or stream is ﬂowing out the polyps can not live in fresh water next there are barrier reefs these are great walls of coral at distance from the shore with deep water between the two the polyps are unable to work at greater depth than about thirty fathoms or one hundred and eighty feet below the surface and it often happens that while there is deep water close to the shores of tropical island there is shallow water farther out in such case the polyps have to build out at sea instead of close into the land and there is kind of moat between the coral bank and the shore in this case the bank is called barrier reef and sometimes it is of enormous size the great barrier reef instance runs less than 1250 miles along the northeast coast of australia then thirdly there are coral islands or atolls there are thousands of these wonderful islands in the paciﬁc and the indian oceans and others are still being slowly pushed up out of the sea they always take the form of more or less circular rings in the center of which is lake of called lagoon the coral bank of which they consist is seldom more than few hundred feet wide but sometimes the islands are very large indeed the biggest of all is ninety miles long and sixty miles broad while several others are not very much smaller soon after they rise to the surface of the sea kind of soil is deposited upon them made up partly of powdered coral ground up by the action of the waves and partly of decaying vegetable matter which has been ﬂung up on them then bring mud upon their feet from the mainland or from another island at distance and leave some of it behind them when they settle down to rest and in that mud are seeds of plants which soon begin to sprout and grow so in very few years the island is covered with low vegetation then one day perhaps ﬂoating cocoanut is ﬂung up and that too takes root and grows so that in course of time there is other of course follow and the result is that the ﬁrst glimpse which traveler gets of coral island is nearly always that of row of upon the horizon the simple corals live in almost all parts of the ocean some of them are occasionally dredged up off our coasts and can live in very cold water but the are only found in warm seas and are never found working far outside the boundaries of the tropics how wonderful it seems that tiny creatures such these polyps which really not appear to be much more than little lump s of living jelly should be able to build up these vast masses of coral from out of the depths of the sea one can not help wondering what the results of their work will be if the world should last few thousand years longer it would really seem that by that time the tropical seas will be choked up with coral islands and the lagoons inside them will be ﬁlled up with coral too so that not merely islands but continents will have been raised from the ocean by some of the smallest and weakest and most insigniﬁcant of all living animals 434 435 436 the project

are adult males walks with turalist suggestions teacher and pupil in nature study i spring let us suppose that we are taking four country walks together and trying to use in actual experience in the ﬁeld the information we have been reading the ﬁrst shall be in the spring the second in summer the third when autumn leaves are falling and the last in midwinter we will go along the follow the lane through the woods to the creek then down the stream to the road and so homeward there is plenty to be seen this bright spring morning the birds are very busy of course they have nests to build and eggs to lay and little ones to take care of so they are hard at work from the very ﬁrst thing in the morning till the very last thing at night almost every sparrow that we see has feather or piece of straw in its beak and the robin which has just ﬂown out of that tree with terriﬁed squall has already ﬁnished building and was most likely sitting upon her eggs yes there is her nest you see right on the lowest limb with four greenish blue eggs 437 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https that catbird all with black cap see her dodge into that bush just beyond us it is just the place her nest and sure enough here it is it is rough affair but she mews pitifully at us if it were the ﬁnest of homes and half dozen other birds are already screaming their sympathy let us just look at the eggs and remember that they are deep polished green and then walk on the poor mother is very unhappy we have use the eggs and it would be shameful to rob her and besides we should thus destroy the coming lives of four catbirds who will be too useful hunters in our gardens to be wasted this path is dusty and we notice great many pinhole doors of the little black ants the ants are running in and out of them and if we should carefully dig up the ground we would ﬁnd labyrinth of narrow passages here and there widening into chambers and so learn that these tiny holes are entrances to an whose streets are all subways here are some larger times regular procession of them going and coming out from under that stone winding through the grass and then trotting up and down this lot of them go out along that low limb let us climb upon the fence and try to see what it is that attracts them ah this is the secret clustered thickly on the bark are hundreds of minute green creatures smaller than pinheads they are busily sucking the sap from the bark and seem to interes t the ants greatly they are stroking these aphids with their feelers and if we had we could see that they were licking up liquid which oozes out of two short tubes on the back of each aphid little distance beyond the ant young maple stretches one of its branches out to the sunlight just above our heads where the sharp eyes which young naturalists must keep wide open when they walk abroad will notice bird nest hung under the shelter of its broad outermost leaves it is one of the loveliest nests in the world slim graceful little bird glides out from beneath the we approach perches near by and watches us silently though she does not mew and scream did the catbird she is just anxious you may be sure be easy dear little we know your shall not ruin your home let us pull the branch gently down little now we can see that the nest is round hammock woven of grapevine bark and spider and hung by its edges it seems too fragile to hold the weight of the mother slight she is and in it are three white eggs with circle of pink and purple dots around their larger ends but here is also fourth egg much larger grayish white and speckled all over with brown that is the egg of the cowbird sort of purple blackbird which you may almost always see in pastures where there are cattle the cowbirds like the european cuckoos never build any nests of their own but put their eggs into those of other birds and leave them to be hatched and they are very fond of choosing the nest of vireo one would think that the mother would notice at once that strange egg had been placed in her nest and would throw it out but she never seems to so but sits on the cowbird egg well on her own so that in course of time she hatches out three or four little vireos and one young cowbird then what you think the stranger does why soon the mother vireo goes out to look caterpillars food it begins to wriggle underneath the other little birds and soon shoves them out of the nest one after another still more strange is it that when the vireo comes back she never seems to care that her own little ones are all lying dead on the ground below but gives all the food that they would have eaten to the cowbird and the greedy cowbird eats it all until it is ﬂedged she feeds it in this way and takes the greatest care of it and even after it has left the nest and is able to ﬂy about she will come and put caterpillars into its beak look at the trunk of this tree why has so much of the bark fallen away from the wood and what is this curious pattern engraved it were upon the broad groove running downward and numb er of smaller grooves branching out from this on each side ah that is the work of very odd little beetle with black head and about eighteen months ago probably mother beetle came ﬂying along settled on the tree and bored hole through the bark just big enough her to pass 438 439 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https then she began to burrow downward between the bark and the wood cutting the central groove which you see in the pattern she did so she kept on laying eggs ﬁrst on one side of the groove and then on the other in the short which she cut out she went along in this way she laid perhaps eighty or ninety eggs altogether when the last had been laid she turned round climbe d up her burrow again passed into the hole by which she came in in it and by so doing she blocked up her burrow with her dead body and so prevented centipedes and other hungry creatures from getting in and eating up her eggs early in the following spring all the eggs hatched and out came number of hungry little grubs with hard horny heads and strong sharp little jaws every one of these grubs at once began to make burrow of its own boring away at right angles to the groove made by the mother beetle and cutting away the ﬁbers which bind the bark to the wood the consequence was of course that by the time they were fully grown quite big piece of bark had been cut away and very likely if we were to come and look at the tree again in two years time we should ﬁnd that the whole of the trunk had been completely stripped then these little beetles are very mischievous oh they are not they never touch healthy tree they only attack those trees which are sickly or diseased here we are on the banks of the stream let us make our way home by the path which lies beside it ah did you see that ﬂash of blue and white and orange that went darting by almost like streak of light sounding loud rattling call he ﬂew it was kingﬁsher and if we stand quite still minute or two without moving so much ﬁnger we shall very likely see him again yes there he is sitting on that branch overhanging the stream and peering down into the water beneath he is watching little ﬁshes upon which he feeds there he has caught sight of one and down he drops into the water splashes about moment or two and then rises with minn ow in his beak back he ﬂies to his perch slaps the little ﬁsh against the branch once or twice to kill it jerks it up into the air catches it head foremost it falls and then swallows it with one big gulp moment later he is peering down into the water again on the lookout another that hole in the face of the steep bank across the stream is the doorway of the kingﬁsher home if we could get there and should try to dig it we would ﬁnd it hard task from that round door tunnel runs into the ground probably six or eight feet and ends in chamber where lie half dozen pure white eggs resting upon the bones of ﬁshes and scraps of every sort which make very place the young kingﬁshers to be born in but they not mind that the butterﬂy that has just ﬂoated by is small and it has lived through the winter which kills nearly all of the butterﬂy tribe that is why its wings are faded and chipped it had six or eight weeks of active life before it hid itself away last of all in hollow tree and entered upon nths slumber sometimes on warmer day than usual these and certain other butterﬂie s will be roused up and will ﬂutter about in the sunshine so that now and then you may capture even in the christmas holidays the warm may sunshine is enticing out many minute and ﬂies especially dancing companies of small sulphur yellow and other companies of blue butterﬂies whirl about one another over the rapidly growing grass have you noticed among the may ﬂowers how many are yellow there are dandelions and yellow violets and the modest ﬁveﬁnger low in the herbage while above them tower great tufts of wild mustard and indigo the buttercups the and many another the frogs and toads are less noisy than month ago and one sees fewer masses and strings of eggs in the roadside ditches than in april but in their place the pools swarm with tadpoles and it will be well worth your while to keep watch of their growth try to ﬁnd out what they eat and what eats them observe when the tail begins to disappear and how it is lost when the legs begin to appear and which pair ﬁrst shows itself you 440 441 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https learn lot of interesting facts about frogs and toads before the summer is done if you are diligent in this stream are few turtles can you tell when and where they lay their eggs keep careful watch of the little sandy beaches and perhaps you may see one digging hole in which to bury her set of sixty or so leaving the sun to supply better warmth than she could give them may is month of activity snakes they have thrown off the stiffness and drowsiness of their long winter torpidity and grown thin after ﬁve months of fasting are running about in search of food let the frogs and toads the beetles and young sparrows and weak from their winter heed the swift blacksnake or sly garter or rapacious water will seize them before they have time to squeal the water in the stream is still cool but the ﬁshes are struggling up the current pickerel are spawning in the weedy shallows and among the pebbles of the bottom host of young creatures are beginning to grow vigorous none among them is more active than the larval or s anglers call them here is now its gauzy wings folded tentwise over its back all its earlier life was spent in the water and when it was grub it lived in very curious case which it made by cutting up rush into short lengths and sticking them together by means of kind of natural glue when once has made one of these cases it never gets out of it again but drags it about wherever it goes and if you try to pull it out you will ﬁnd that you can not so without killing it at the end of its body it has pair of strong little pincers with which it holds on so ﬁrmly and so doggedly to its case that you might actually pull it in two without forcing it to loose its hold there are different kinds of however and the grub of one kind fastens grains of sand together to make case while that of another sticks two dead leaves face to face and lives between them it would be an interesting task boy or girl to see how many different kinds of judging by their cases lived in the stream and to keep them alive in an aquarium and watch their behavior and changes ii summer walk in midsummer is stroll through what seems quiet world compared with the noise and brightness of may then every leaf was green and crisp every bird in full song and the world seemed to have an air of gay youth like vigorous boy or girl full of eagerness and activity now july draws toward its end the eagerness has subsided and the year like lad grown little older and more serious has settled down to regular work had our walk been taken before breakfast we should have heard end of birds singing it is true but about the time the dew dried from the grass most of them ceased their music one reason besides the noonday heat is that they are too busy to sing the husband and and he is the singer of the now help his mate feed her young we fear however he is not very good provider after the ﬂedglings quit the nest leaving most of their support and schooling to the mother at this season one may often come upon and watch little family group of this kind and perhaps we may so meanwhile let us sit down moment on this grassy too near that post you not see twined about it that vine with the reddish hairy stem and the shining leaves in groups of threes that is the which may cause an itching rash to break out upon your skin if you touch it you must learn to recognize and avoid this ivy is not true ivy but kind of climbing you go poking around in the ﬁelds or you will be sorry you notice the delicious odor 442 443 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https the air that comes from the big yellow branches of blossoms on another and perfectly harmless kind of scraggly sort of bush just beyond the fence see how the bees are humming about of them from farmer hive others big bumblebees and small burrowing kinds all are in search of the minute drops of sweet liquid which each of the tiny ﬂowers in the contains and which turns into honey after it has been carried little while in the insect crop or lower part of the throat where it lodges then it is suitable to be really swallowed or to be coughed up and fed to the young bees at home or stored away in the cells of such bees store up honey many wild bees not make such stores besides its nectar however every ﬂower contains quantity of small particles like dust which are produced in the heads of the little interior parts of the blossom called the stamens and in order that the ﬂower shall turn to seed it is needful that some grains of this dust or pollen shall fall upon another hollow part called the pistil and so pass down into its base it is much better that the pollen of one ﬂower shall get into the pistil of another than into its own the wind manages this to some the shaking or blowing the loose pollen out of one ﬂower and into another but the bees help this process greatly and so may be said to pay the sweets they use watch this one buzzing in front of that clump of jewelweed suddenly the loud humming ceases and the bee crowd s herself into the hanging blossom searching the nectar now she is backing slowly out and you may see how her furry body is with yellow dust that is pollen and when she dives into another jewel she will brush some of it off against the pistil there which is right in her way and is very glad to accept her gift so the bees and other insects humming about the ﬂowers in this hot sunshine are not only getting their living but helping the plants to keep vigorous and produce lots of healthy seed now let us move on the sky is ﬁlled with swallows there are the ones that make their nests inside the barn the ones that form their curious shaped nests of mud on the outside under the eaves and the purple martins that live in our in the garden they are darting and dashing and skimming about in air though they did not know what it is to be tired and if only they were little closer we should see that every one of them has its mouth wide open the reason is that these birds have very sticky tongues and that all the time they are in the air they are chasing ﬂying insects bothersome gnats and mosquitoes among the rest soon one of these insects is touched by the tongue it sticks to it then without swallowing it the bird tucks it away in the upper part of its throat and goes off to hunt another after time it has quite ball of little bugs packed away in this curious manner and can carry more so it ﬂies of f to its nest and divides them among its little ones you see that small bird sitting very erect on that suddenly springs into the air ﬂutters up and down just half moment and then returns to the post it is ﬂycatcher and hours together it will go on catching insects just in that same way it alights it tells us its name calling in sad sort of voice though there is reason to think it is sorrowful at all if we should go down to that bridge over the stream in the valley we would ﬁnd its solid nest of moss and mud among the stones of one of the piers the woodland path is not so good place birds are more open spaces but one hears here the distant cooing of dove the shout of the scarlet tanager red ﬁre everywhere except on its black wings and tail and often the tapping of woodpecker there is one at work now on that tall dead stub if you want to see him you must keep perfectly still if he notice s that he is watched he begins to think some harm may follow and either ﬂies away or stops work scrambling around the trunk and peering out from behind it with one eye to see what you mean to next see how ﬁrmly he clings to the trunk if you were close enough you could see that two of the toes at the end of his short strong legs and feet were straight forward and two straight backward and that he is also propping himself up by means of his short stiff little tail which is bent inward and really serves kind of natural now he is pecking away at the bark with his strong beak and making the chips ﬂy in all 444 445 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https most likely the grub of some burrowing beetle is lying hidden in the wood below and he is trying to dig it out but he will not have to dig down to the very bottom of its tunnel he has very long slender tongue with tip and this tip is very sticky and with this after he has enlar ged the mouth of the burrow he will lick out the little grub which is lying hidden away within it now let us make our way to the path by the side of the stream what number of galls there are on these on the leaves some hanging down from the twigs in clusters like currants and some growing on the twigs themselves you know what causes them well very tiny ﬂy pricks hole in leaf or young shoot by means of kind of sharp sting at the end of her body and in that hole she places an egg together with very small drop of peculiar liquid this liquid has an irritating effect on the leaf or twig and causes swelling to grow and when this has reached its full size and become what we call gall little grub hatches out of the egg and begins to feed upon it sometimes there are several grubs in one gall if we were to cut one of those large red and white to pieces probably we should ﬁnd many dozen each lying curled up in hollow which it had eaten out if naturalist had to choose some one place in which to carry on his outdoor studies he could ﬁnd none better than the cours of small rural river and year work would not exhaust it just now in midsummer he would be most interested in the nesting of the sunﬁsh and minnows let us steal quietly to the brink where the turf forms little bank foot or so high to which the bottom slopes up in clear sand and gravel with here and there clump of bulrushes let us lie down and scan this bottom through the clear water rippling gently by keeping very quiet so not to alarm any ﬁshes which may swim near they are the very fellows we wish to see here comes little common golden cautiously toward an open space much smaller so big your little oots past him and stops suddenly if it had run against wall then an instant later is off again so swiftly you can hardly see it move wonder it is called johnny darter meanwhile the shiner minnow in of burnished gold moves slowly on where is he aiming ah look over there you see that low ring of sand about large dinner plate running about some clear grave l though the plate were strewn with small pebbles that is nest of sunﬁsh and look did you see the swoop of that gray shadow from the bulrushes the shiner turned and ﬂed like bright streak through the water and now the gray shadow is poised over the nest and we see that it is the sunﬁsh or you say the boys call it when they go see how with its it fans the gravel among which its eggs are lying they are so small and transparent that we can not see them but they are there and must be kept clean so the ﬁsh stirs the water and the current sweeps away everything which may have lodged there while the owner was away few minutes but he never goes far he must guard his treasures against enemi es like the shiner and other ﬁshes salamanders water and the like which would eat them if they dared butterﬂies innumerable greet us and dance along the roadside if to see us safely home many are small and yellow or white and yellow with handsomely bordered wings and they are greatly interested in the clover then we see plenty of little blues very regular in outline and with them various coppers distinguished by their orange and brown colors each with coppery tinge and set off by black markings the are brown too with delicate stripes ornaments on the lower surface which are shown neatly when the wings are closed upright above the back did you know this was one of the distinctive marks of butterﬂy moth never holds its wings on high in that fashion but it is the larger butterﬂies that ﬁrst catch the eye such the monarch and the viceroy the fritillaries and black with trimmings of silver the red admiral and other anglewings beautiful in outline well in colors the delicately pretty browns and the magniﬁcent swallowtails and 446 447 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https you think it would be interesting and delightful to study these exquisite creatures iii autumn it is bright warm day in october and once more we go our ramble everything seems changed the autumn ﬂowers are blooming the autumn tints are in the leaves and again there are different animals and different birds and different insects almost everywhere around us we hardly take ten steps before there is sudden commotion in clump of tall grass by the path and mouse leaps almost over our toes and dives down little hole which otherwise we should not have noticed doubtless he carried mouthful of to add to his granary under ground all over the country mice and gophers and squirrels are doing the same thing there big gray squirrel now scratching hole in the ground busily terrier who thinks he smells mole suddenly he stops drops into the little grave paws the dirt and leaves over it pats them down and canters away all day he is burying nuts so that when next winter the trees are bare he may dig them up and feed upon their meat sometimes he does need to or forgets and then tree may spring up many ﬁne hickory or chestnut was planted in this way by squirrels chickadee and nutha tch what is that red squirrel doing under the by the side of the lane he is hard at work collecting chestnuts stufﬁ ng his big cheeks with them and carrying them away to hide use next winter he seems to realize that although he will sleep in his bed under the stone fence almost the whole time from thanksgiving to easter he will wake up now and then on warm days and will feel dreadfully hungry but then there will be little to be found in the way of food so he is now gathering nuts and acorns and dry mushrooms and hiding them away so to be prepared some he puts in hole in the trunk of tree others in crevices in the stone wall others he takes into his hole under ground where his cousin the saucy chipmunk stores all of his savings 448 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https how the pretty little animal uses his bushy tail he scampers along branch you see that he holds it stretched out behind him and keeps on turning it slightly ﬁrst to one side and then to the other the fact is that it helps him to keep his balance when man walks upon the tight rope he generally carries in his hands long pole which is weighted at each end with lead then if he feels that he is losing his balance he can almost always recover it again by tilting up his pole the squirrel tail serves him sort of and by turning it little bit to one side or little bit to the other he can run along the slenderest branches at full speed without any danger of falling everywhere we go we hear the whirring of grasshoppers the chirping of black crickets and the shrill declarations of the katydids blind man who could not see the scarlet of the maples the deep crimson and purple of sumachs the pepperidge and the blackberry thickets or the golden glow in the birches the sunlight strikes through them would know the season of the year by the sounds how the insects make their one can hardly call it singing that will be good subject you to look up in your books the air is ﬁlled with the droning and humming of other insects how are these sounds produced we notice the more perhaps because other animals are so quiet it is rare to hear the croak of frog or the piping of or the note of bird what has become of the birds when we see few they are in ﬂocks and seem very intent on traveling somewhere the truth is they are gathering in companies and journeying away to the south where winter with its cold and snow and hunger can not follow them next spring they will come back again to spend the summer with us only those birds remain which can live upon seeds or pick up rough fare along the band of small winged friends are ﬂitting about among the weeds ahead of us you not know them look closely are the form and black wings familiar you would say they were goldﬁnches if they were more yellow would you now you see that that is what they are but in an olive dress the fact is that all birds molt their feathers twice year in spring the new feathers come out in bright colors and in autumn there worn gay coats are lost and feathers of duller hue take their place thus the brilliant yellow and black goldﬁnch of summer becomes quiet quaker in winter such change is very advantageous to the you may study out yourselves butterﬂies are scarce too but these have died not run away the birds are doing one sees good many sluggish caterpillars however and sharp eyes may begin to ﬁnd cocoons hanging from the bushes or tucked into crevices of bark or plastered against rocks and the boards of old fences if you were to keep account of all the different kinds you could ﬁnd you would soon have long list and if you were to learn how to keep them properly and care the butterﬂies and moths which will come out of them in the spring you could start an admirable cabinet here is patch of milkweed examine each plant thoroughly because there may be gift you hidden among the leaves you have found something pretty you say what is it like like green thimble with rows of gold buttons on it that is pretty accurate description only your thimble is closed at the top where it hangs by short thread and it is heavy and alive it is the lovely chrysalis of the milkweed butterﬂy next summer you must learn the appearance of that species which you can easily it is one of our lar gest and commonest ones where the milkweeds grow you are pretty sure to see also masses of goldenrod and towering high above them the great ﬂowering pillars of such clumps are good autumnal insects there gather the soldier brilliant in uniforms of yellow and black they are sometimes so numerous to bend down the plants by their weight and are in consta nt motion crawling about the blossoms or ﬂying from spray to spray here too come beetles black with line of yellow v on the back whose eggs are laid in the soft inner bark of and fat winged blister or which leave such bad odor on the hands when touched this is due to an acrid oil which oozes out of the joints of the beetle legs when it is handled and thinks itself in danger it is protection it both smells and tastes so nasty that bird will ever attempt to eat an and its body is so very big 449 450 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https it lays such an enormous number of eggs how many eggs you think an beetle will lay why something like thirty thousand she lays them in batches in little holes in the ground and few days afterward tiny little grub hatches out of each egg and begins to hunt about some ﬂower that bees are likely to visit when it ﬁnds one it climbs up the stem hides among the petals and waits then soon bee settles upon the ﬂower it springs upon her and clings to her hairy body the bee is very busy collecting nectar and pollen and the grub is very tiny so she never seems to notice that the little creature is clinging to her and carries it back with her to her nest then the grub lets go and proceeds to eat all the which the bee had stored up so carefully her own little ones how is it that all the trees bushes and plants are covered with threads of spider silk which often annoys us by getting on our hands or faces let us help you to an answer this is the time of year when spiders are most numerous and most active and many spider trails behind it thread of gossamer wherever it goes and leaves it there on many of the plants bushes trees and fences you may see if you look closely very small spiders resting those little spiders have been taking journey through the sort of balloon trip during the summer number of spiders all living near one another had big hundred or more in each perhaps you noticed in july and august spiders dragging about large white bundles they were packets of eggs from which the young hatched so many coming into the world together made it difﬁcult to ﬁnd food so one by one the little spiders climbed low bushes or tall plants and perched themselves on the tips of the topmost leaves then each poured out from the end of its body slender thread of silk which ﬂoated straight up in the warm air rising from the heated ground at last each little spider had seven or eight feet of thread rising up into the air above it then suddenly it loosed its hold of the leaf and mounted into the air at the end of its own thread higher and higher and higher till it had risen several hundreds of feet into the air then it met gentle breeze traveling slowly overhead and traveled along with it mile after mile still resting on its threa and when it wanted to come down all that it had to was to roll up the thread till there was not quite enough left to support it and so it came ﬂoating gently down to the ground below then having more use the thread it broke loose from it and left it lying like fallen telegraph wire across the tops of the bushes and fences and other things where our faces brush against it what pretty green ﬂy this is sitting upon the fence with delicate gauzy wings looking like the most delicate lacework yes that is lacewing ﬂy just notice what wonderful eyes it has they look like little globes of crimson ﬁre and it is quite difﬁcult to believe that tiny lamp is not alight inside the head this ﬂy lays its eggs in most curious way settling on twig she pours out drop of kind of thick gum from the end of her body then jerking her body suddenly upward she draws out this gum into slender thread which hardens soon it comes into contact with the air and just she lets go she fastens an egg to the tip she then lays another egg in the same manner and then another and then another and so she goes on till she has laid quite little cluster of ninety or hundred altogether you would not think that they were eggs if you were to see them you would be almost sure to think that the little cluster was tuft of moss indeed great many years even botanists thought that these eggs were kind of moss and put pictures of them in books of botany accordingly look at these odd little black and white spiders how jerkily they run never moving more than an inch or so at time then stopping to rest and then generally darting off again in different direction they are and are so called because they hunt insects instead of trying to catch them in web you may see one of these spiders stalking ﬂy very much cat creeps up to bird and then suddenly springing upon it and leaping into the air with its victim ﬁrm in its grip slowly the days grow shorter the rains come more frequently ﬂowers wither and the herbage shrivels insects die off the birds one by one disappear quietly or gather in ﬂocks to journey southward and the woods grow quiet and gray 451 452 453 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https winter we look out of the window on landscape of snow or of earth frozen roads and leaﬂess trees the world seems lifeless but one who starts out walk anxious to discover whether all nature is really dead will soon ﬁnd that it is very much alive though much of it is buried in slumber let us test it we take the path we can not but contrast the bareness and silence with the activity and color and cheerful noise about us when few weeks ago we strolled this way the thought saddens and discourages us little when suddenly there comes to our ears saucy note out of sound heart and merry throat if it said day good sir fine afternoon old passenger happy to meet you in these places where january brings few faces there is the dozen of them in fy little gray birds not much bigger than man thumb dodging busily about the limbs of that old swinging with desperate clutch at the tip of twig hanging head downward to get at morsel on the under side of the bough and chattering all the time though cold weather were hardship at all what they ﬁnd to eat keep your eyes on one and see if you can not guess he is pecking here and there at the bark and swallowing something so minute we can not recognize it but you not remember how last summer we watched the procession of ants climbing this very tree to get honey from herd of aphids on the branches those are still there each hidden under sort of scale like winter blanket and it is these that the chickadees are pulling off and eating it takes great many of them to make meal and the birds must keep very busy perhaps that is one reason why they seem so happy busy person is usually cheerful one when you meet winter group of these merry tomtits it is well to wait quietly little while since you are pretty sure to ﬁnd others following them there you hear that sharp tapping turn your head and you will see small woodpecker with its checkered black and white coat and broad white stripe down the back hewing away at the thick bark of that oak he is tremendously in earnest and let us hope he ﬁnds good fat grub gliding down the next comes something which an instant we take is so bluish and furtive but it is has straight slender bill almost like woodpecker and which digs into the cracks and crannies eggs and hiding grubs of small insects now and then smashing acorn the wormy meal it contains or tearing to pieces the fuzzy cocoon of tussock it has an odd habit of working almost always head downward and now and then lifts its head and squeaks out sharp though it said never cold quite likely on the next tree brown brown little lady of gliding about the trunk very daintily picking and searching with her long slender and curving beak similar hidden food she is dear little creature even prettier are the kinglets that often form one of this little company of winter workers they are the smallest of all american birds except the hummers and are olive green with tiny crowns of gold and rubies one might say they have the activity and nimbleness of the chickadees and toward spring cheer us with brilliant song these lovely pygmies are cousins of the wrens and one may sometimes see ﬂitting about the brush real wren which in summer ﬂies away to the far north letting us hear few 454 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https in march before he leaves specimens of the exquisite song with which he will make the canadian woods ring when next june he meets his mate and builds his nest among the great pines and spruces most of our birds you know ﬂee southward when cold weather approaches but some like the crow many birds of prey hawks and owls some such bob white and the grouse several of the sparrow tribe and some others such the little fellows we have been watching stay with us because they ﬁnd plenty of food if we should go out every day of the winter we could make long list of these by the time all fools day came around to it might be added goodly list of birds whose proper home is in northern canada but which in midwinter come south to country which is less snowy if not less cold the snowbirds with their satiny feet and ivory bills dressed like gentlemen in coats and white vests to which you toss crumbs from the breakfast table every morning are in this class doubtless we shall see others we turn down the wooded lane that leads to the creek here among these bushes is good place to look cocoons of moths and butterﬂies one is pretty sure to see at once few of those of the big promethea moth folded within large leaf the stem of which is lashed by silk threads to its twig so that it will not fall or be blown away very likely on the same bush will hang similar big cocoon but this one fastened all along the under side of the twig so that it is search about among the leaves beneath the bush and you may ﬁnd the cocoons of the great polyphemus and of that exquisite which ﬂits like ghost to our lighted windows on summer nights but these are the giants of their race hundreds of smaller cocoons and papery fuzzy leathery or naked and varnished to keep out the damp may be discovered in the crevices of the old fence upon and beneath the rough bark of trees rolled up in leaves little and big and buried in the ground where the moles hunt them when the ground is not frozen too hard and the skunks dig them up how about the moles and the skunks well the moles are by means active in summer though they move around some what under the frozen layer of in search of the earthworms which have been driven deep down by the frost the skunks they like the woodchucks the chipmunks and the red squirrels are deeply sleeping in under ground beds but plenty of are wide awake see how that gray squirrel is making the snow ﬂy he paws his way down to the nut he buried three months ago only the tip of the plume of his tail waves above the drift you see that double row of holes punched in the snow every country boy knows them the track of rabbit and would tell you how fast the rabbit was going but what embroidered on the glistening this lovely chain that extends wavily from this tree to that stone wall weasel little cares he cold in his white ermine coat and many the careless sparrow and snugly mouse that falls to his quick spring and sharp white teeth the weasel nearest cousin the mink is working his living too these winter days haunting the warm in hope of catching eels or other ﬁsh perhaps we shall see some signs of his work along the creek and now we have come to the end of the last of our rambles but think that we have seen nearly all that there is to be seen if we had been able to spend little more time in the ﬁelds or the lane or the wood or on the banks of the stream we should have noticed great many more animals and birds and reptiles and insects quite curious and quite interesting any of those which we have met with and if we had taken dozen rambles together instead of only four each time we should have found fresh creatures to look at and fresh marvels to wonder at and fresh beauties to admire wherever we go nature always has something new to show us and the world is full of wonderful sights every one who has eyes to see 455 456 457 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https at the seaside introduction many very curious and interesting creatures are to be found on the seashore and we dare say you would like to know something about them so let us take in thought four rambles along the shore together first we will go stroll on the sandy beach which is left quite dry some little time when the tide goes down next we will pay visit to the stretches of mud just above mark left bare in the coves perhaps couple of hours twice each day our third ramble we will wander about among the rocks and examine the creatures which are crawling about on them or burrowing into them or hiding underneath the great masses of seaweed with which they are covered and then lastly we will search in the pools which lie between the rocks where we shall probably ﬁnd some of the most interesting animals of all we will suppose that these walks are on our atlantic coast we have not time now to explore the shores of the paciﬁc and describe its animals many of which are very different from those of the eastern coast i along the sandy beach all the coast of the united states south of new york and cape cod and long island besides are formed of soil and pebbles ground off the tops and sides of the appalachian ranges of mountains the ocean beaches and the bottom of the sea near shore are all of sand constantly swept by currents and moved by storms on such plain of shifting sand not many plants or animals can live save those which are able to swim or to bury themselves and not nearly so long list can be made among the rocks which give and shelter or where the bottom is muddy we shall see later yet walk will enable us to ﬁnd good many things about which you ought to know something here instance are lot of shells the hard outer coats of the soft boneless creatures we call mollusks such you know very well on land snails when you have ﬁlled your little basket if we asked you to sort them into two kinds you would be almost sure to put those which consist of two pieces attached together into one pile and those which are in one solid piece and more or less twisted like snail into the other this would mark real division the ﬁrst heap would have the mollus ks which we call bivalves and the second would have those coiled gastropod mollusks that we may call the bivalves scattered along the beach are all dead and mostly broken they have been washed up from muddy places but many of the may be found alive and belong here on the sand and so we may look ﬁrst at them here is big one to begin with which the southern ﬁshermen call conch and the northern oystermen winkle it is shaped like pear and pushing out of its shell very tough muscular part of its body called the foot it plows along in the sand or even burrows into it small end ﬁrst searching food which consists of animal matter either dead or alive it ﬁnds this by its sense of smell and when it comes to it thrusts out of its head near the forward end of the foot long tongue covered with hundreds of minute ﬂinty teeth and rasps away the ﬂesh winkles are numerous everywhere and are of great service in devouring dead ﬁsh which would pollute the water but they also eat great quantity of oysters we shall see presently you will ﬁnd two kinds and should note how their shells dif fer very likely you will ﬁnd among the long rows of dead and f marking the reach of high tides twisted string of most curious objects each about big 458 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https cent feeling if made of yellow paper and strung together like necklace on stiff cord these are the eggs of conch or more truly the in each capsule was placed an egg you can prove it by opening some of them in the dry ones you will probably ﬁnd only dead young shells hardly bigger than which have hatched from the eggs but now and then you may pick up soft and elastic set and in these which are alive or have only lately been torn from the weeds in deep water and thrown upon the beach you will ﬁnd much larger baby conchs which by and by would have found way out and begun to travel about we have already picked up several different sorts of slender twisted of small size and few big walnut and almost round save the circular opening out of which the animal pushes its foot his name is natica and he is one of the worst foes of the clam whose shell he bores here half buried in the wet sand at the edge of the gentle surf is living one and we can see the grooved trail behind him showing where he has traveled we will pick him up and see how hastily he shrinks back into the armor of his shell and shuts his door with plate growing upon the of his foot all these have such plate sometimes thin and horny like this one sometimes thick and and if you try to pry it away you will have to tear it to pieces the frightened animal will not let go its strong hold he knows better than to open his door and let you pick him out even if you did you would have to tear his body out piecemeal he would by means uncoil it from around the central post of his house and let himself be dragged out whole this door is good protection then against the claws of crabs and the nibbling teeth of ﬁshes and various small parasites which would like to get at him it is called an operculum just lift up some of that seaweed and stuff which the waves have piled up why the sand underneath it is simply alive with sandhoppers besides various jumping and crawling insects spiders etc but the sandhoppers are most must be hundred all skipping about so actively that it is quite difﬁcult to follow their movements they were feeding upon the seaweed and their sharp little jaws are so powerful that if you were to tie up few sandhoppers in your handkerchief and carry them home you would be almost sure to ﬁnd that they had nibbled number of little holes in it by the time that you got there but surely such little creatures sandhoppers can not very much good even by eating decaying seaweed ah but there are so many of them wherever the shore is sandy they live in thousands and even in millions if you walk along the edge of the sea sometimes when the tide is rising you will see them skipping about in such vast numbers that the air looks if it were ﬁlled with kind of mist foot or eighteen inches from the ground and though many of the feed upon them and some of the so too and the eat very great many yet their numbers never seem to grow less these sandhoppers are small cousins of the crabs with which we shall get acquainted when we go to the and search would ﬁnd many others such of various kinds here and there are strange grooves one of them is growing longer under our very eyes dig away the sand just ahead of it and see what you can ﬁnd there it small creature about twice big it is or hippa and it burrows along just under the surface searching minute particles of food among the grains and letting the sand fall in behind it it does not mean to make tunnel one of the waste objects you tossed aside was piece of wood which the waves have ﬂung up and which doubt once formed part of wrecked vessel and i wonder some one exclaims if all the timbers were rotten that the bit of timber is certainly what has happened to it it is full of long round burrows each about big enough to admit and so close together that the walls between them are very little thicker than paper and every burrow seems to be lined with kind of glaze that is the work of curious creature known the world over the which often does great deal of mischief by burrowing into the hulls of ships and the timbers supporting wharfs and harbor buildings it has soft round body bigger than 459 460 461 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https of stout string and often nearly foot in length but it is really mollusk like the cockle and the clam and if you were to look closely at the fore end of its body you would see its bivalve shells although they are so very small that they might easily be mistaken jaws when ﬁrst this animal hatches from the egg it is not in the least like its parents it is just little creature covere d almost all over with hairs by waving which up and down it manages to swim about in the water but it does not keep its shape very long if you were to look at it about hours later you would ﬁnd that it was oval instead of round hours later still it would be almost triangular while next day it would be almost round again and so it would go on changing its form day after day till at last it fastened itself down by its ﬂeshy foot to piece of sunken timber and began to burrow in it and then at last it would take the form of its parents the birth and growth of most of the bivalves is similar to this and it must be remembered that these changing larval forms are hardly lar ge enough to see another timber all along the new england coast is the gribble crustacean related to the sandhoppers which is not bigger than grain of wheat and looks like it devours wood wherever it ﬁnds it under water and will gradually honeycomb and weaken until they fall to pieces the bases of piles and other timbers under water which are not sheathed with copper or ﬁlled with creosote therefore it is much hated sandy beach is not the place crabs in general but there is one kind which we ought to ﬁnd here there is one now but one might wager something that you ca discover it in its unless shown to you you see those two little round objects on short stems sticking half an inch out of the sand by that old yes well please go and get one or both of them what is it alive some sort of crab buried in the sand all it up but look out it does nip you those claws are powerful with them the crabs must seize and ﬁrmly hold struggling slippery ﬁsh and other animals until it can subdue and eat them notice how the hind legs are ﬂattened into strong paddles to enable it to swim swiftly upon its prey in spite of these ﬁerce qualities we call this one because of its richly ornamented greenish yellow profusely marked with purple rings it spends most of its time crawling or swimming in the sea where the bottom is sandy and the water shallow but now and then comes ashore and buries itself in the dry sand all but its stalked eyes we found this one smaller lighter and more cousin of this crustacean called the is very common on southern beaches where it digs slanting burrows deeply into the sand mayer tells us that it is scavenger feeding on dead animals and also catching and eating it is at night that they are most active they ﬂit rapidly about in the moonlight their popular name of seems remarkably appropriate one approaches they dash off with great rapidity and will often rush into the water although the gray snappers are swimming close along the shore in order to devour them what have you found now it appears to be skillet or made of brown parchment with long spike loosely hinged to one side handle and big crab lying on its back in the pan wonder you are surprised the ﬁrst white men who came to this country were equally so nothing of the sort is to be seen in any other part of the world except in the malayan islands if we search we are likely to ﬁnd one alive and creeping about and then we shall see that the skillet is broad shield covering the back of an animal and that what we thought was the crab inside it is its body and legs when you come to study natural history more deeply you will learn many very interesting things about this strange inhabitant of our beaches which is known or and also limulus it is the sole remnant of great tribe of called trilobites which became extinct ages ago one more curiosity must be mentioned before we quit this ﬁrst short walk upon the open the ﬁshermen call the of which see you have found several 462 463 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https is an egg but you never would have suspected it would you examine it it is about two inches long and made of hard black leathery substance and at each of the four corners there is little projection about an inch in length it is the empty egg of ﬁsh of the shark tribe with broad ﬂat body and long which one of these curious ﬁshes has just escaped how you think it got out of the egg when the time came it to be hatched just look at this empty case and you will see at one end there is slit running across it almost from one side to the other made in such manner that the little ﬁsh could easily push its way out while none of its enemies could push their way in so the baby skate lay in its cradle in safety till the time came it to pass out into the sea but here is an egg made in just the same way with one little difference instead of having short straight projection at each corner it has long coiled twisted one much like the tendril of grapevine that is the egg of one of the small sharks called dogﬁsh which are so called because they swim about in parties or packs of ﬁfty or sixty together driving herring and other ﬁshes before them dogs drive deer the skin of dogﬁsh is rough piece of sandpaper when the eggs of this ﬁsh are ﬁrst laid the twisted projections at the ends coil themselves round the stems of weeds growing at the bottom of the sea and hold them so ﬁrmly that they can not be washed away and at each end there is small hole so that current of water may always ﬂow through this and over the little ﬁsh something of just much importance to it is supply of air to ii searching the shore at low tide the shore of the eastern united states at least south of new york is formed of line of long narrow islets whose outer beaches and the miles out are pure sand they support very little life has been said behind them however are shallow bays and sounds in which the water though salt is usually warm and still mud gathers upon the sand and and other water grow in abundance here is excellent ground naturalists old or young and in single walk you can discover enough to surprise you greatly we must go when the tide is low and it will be good idea to take our rubber boots so that we may not be afraid of the wet mud we will also take small spade or strong trowel and some boxes and bottles what lot of are lying about the shore there are two kinds the soft clam and the hard clam but none of them are alive how is this we have already learned you will remember that the clams are bivalves that is the shell is in two pieces hinged together by an elastic ligament over the back and covering each side of the animal the soft body is attached to each shell by strong muscle by which the creature can pull the shells tight together and so cover itself completely when it wishes however it lets the shells spring open somewhat so that it may put out from between their lower edges its muscular foot and perhaps move about while out of the front end it stretches tube called its siphon down one of the tubes is sucked stream of water which not only bathes the animal gills or breathing organs but carries minute ﬂoating particles of food into its stomach after which the waste water is forced out of the other tube now you will understand what we shall see and are ready the answer to our question you never ﬁnd live clams crawling about the sand because they live buried in the mud now let us put on our boots and look about on the surface of the wet mud you see ahead of us those little jets of water come spouting up into the air if squirted out of tiny syringes every one of these little jets is thrown up by soft clam which lies perhaps several inches deep in the mud with its siphon stretched up to the surface and held full of water waiting the tide to come in and refresh it when it feels the jarring of our footsteps it squirts the water out and you must dig deep and fast if you want to 464 465 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https it this is what those men are doing out there on the out clams with long spades and ﬁlling their baskets market thousands of little ones lie in the mud not yet big enough to eat the soft clam is shapeless sort of mollusk with thin chalky shell not at all pretty but the hard clam or quahog is shelled and regular in outline and in an view takes the shape of an ace of hearts like the or the cockle which is so commonly eaten in europe this species likes much deeper water than the soft clam and is gathered mostly from boats by kind of rake but we shall doubt ﬁnd few up here you see that scratch in the mud it looks like trail and there at the end is the traveler himself standing upright in the mud like wedge this shows another difference between the two clams while the soft clams and their relatives such the pretty razor and the old maid of english bays never leave the burrow where they begin life the quahogs slowly wander about all the time the scallops they fairly skip and jump what are scallops well we shall hardly see much of them they live in deep water but their are to be seen cast up everywhere they also are bivalves our common ones are usually about the size of silver dollar and the thin shell ribbed like the sticks of fan and the margin crinkled and they are variously colored but mostly in tints of reddish and yellow several small bivalves and may be added to our collection from this uncovered and here and there spaces are fairly sprinkled with little blackish fellows about the size of hazelnuts when we have gathered handful we shall ﬁnd we can sort out three or four kinds very curious denizen of the of our southern states is the pinna large bivalve with thin horny shells shaped like slightly opened fan which lies deep ly buried point down the edges of its shell come just at the surface and are exceedingly sharp so that barefooted persons have to be very careful how they step where pinnas are common on the gulf coast of florida and it is wonder the people there call them razor lying there in the mud with its shells parted and current of water always sucking down what we may call its throat it forms regular trap little ﬁshes and other small creatures the instant one swims between the shells they close and the unfortunate ﬁnds himself in prison from which there is escape when young pinna settles down in its place it at once anchors itself to some rock or ﬁxed thing below it by throwing out from near its lower narrow end bunch of very strong threads which hold it down so ﬁrmly that it takes very hard pull to tear them away this anchor is called byssus short distance from us narrow stream wriggles through the salt marsh and we can get into rough little boat and paddle down toward that old wharf whose weedy piles are covered with interesting things which we may examine now that the ebbing tide has left them uncovered few hours the peaty banks with their growth of harsh and algæ will keep our eyes busy we ﬂoat along the black and winding creek now we shall get acquainted with some of the crabs look sharply down into the water and you will see the large blue crabs which we buy in the market and eat swimming near the bottom or crawling over the mud near the banks there is one now he does look very blue nor very appetizing does he his back is brown and muddy to be sure but his big claws and lower plates have much more blue upon them than has any of the other lar ge crabs and so he gets the distinguishing name but you say you have heard of and crabs and want to know the difference it is simply difference of condition if you will turn to page 397 you will ﬁnd described that extraordinary process by which crabs grow by throwing off their stiff old skins and expanding to ﬁll the elastic new one which has formed underneath before this change the creature is in ﬁshermen language and just afterward when he is large and tender he is naturally and then is the time to eat him notice how the black masses of peat along the banks are honeycombed with holes if somebody had been pushing down the point of his umbrella they are the homes of 466 467 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https ﬁddler which scuttle into them by the hundred we approach and then creep up to peer out after we have passed by and make sure it is safe to go abroad again in other holes live two other sorts of burrowing crabs one is the little panopæus which is peaceful cousin of the ﬁddler and the other is the ocypoda whose peculiarity it is to be perfectly so that it is almost impossible to see him until he moves consequently he is commonly found only in the sandy places we ﬂoat nearer to the mouth of our winding creek we begin to notice bunches of clinging closer to each other than grapes in bunch and when we try to pick one up we ﬁnd it quite immovable in fact they are anchored to the roots of the grasses and to each other by bunch of byssus threads from each mussel like those of the pinna and these threads are so strong that they can hold the mussels ﬁrm against the beating of the waves so that shore which is thickly covered with mussels is safe from wearing away you may see an example of this in the tideway at the mouth of this very creek and masses of mussels strengthen the supports of that wharf we are approaching if you were to go near the town of bideford england you would see bridge of four arches which runs across the torridge river close to the place where it joins the taw now that bridge is held together by clusters of mussels the force of the stream is so great that if mortar is used to repair the bridge it is very soon washed away so from time to time large of mussels are taken to the spot and shot into the water and they fasten themselves so ﬁrmly to the bridge by means of their byssus threads that they actually hold together the stones of which it is built these binding mussels are mostly of the smooth sort which are found on both sides of the atlantic and in europe are gathered and eaten when our people become little wiser and more economical we also will take advantage of this great stock of excellent food right at our doors but in the bunches which are scratching the side of the boat we glide along close to the bank are some which are much larger though smooth like the edible muss els they are an american species then here and there in peat you may see sort whose shell is rough with ridges spreading out towar d the large end and these you may call mussels now we have got down to the toward which we have been lazily drifting and we will twist the chain around one of the piles that support it and stop long enough to take look at one of them most of the time each pile is under water and therefore is over grown with thick fur of plants and animals you will see that most of this fur consists of seaweeds but their leaves are often the of several sorts of lowly animals indeed you must look sharp to make sure whether some of the feathery tufts that droop from dank old post or spray out so beautifully in the ripples at its foot are plants or animals we will not talk about that just now but wait till we take our excursion to the rocky shore where we shall ﬁnd barnacles and corallines and and polyps bigger and better than here but you see between those green fronds that roundish yellow object about big ﬁlbert touch it gently did you see tiny jets of water squirt out of two little nozzles on its surface that gives it the name of into one of the nozzles when the tide comes over it is constantly sucked current of which passes into like cavity where the minute particles of food in the water are caught and digested then the water passes on through another cavity where the blood receives its oxygen in our lungs or crab or ﬁsh gills and then rushes out so this little object is real animal with heart blood stomach and something in the way of at any rate to feel your touch shrink and squirt out all the water in its body there are good many kinds and form s of these ascidians naturalists call them some larger some waving about on the summit of stalks like and some clustered into colonies grown together which form bands around the stems of plants or make masses called by the ﬁshermen or ﬂoat in chains by millions on the surface of the open sea 468 469 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https too are small red and yellow sponges some coarse little etc and wandering over the whole feeding upon one or another of these and cleaning the polyps and polyzoans off the algæ are sort of marine called crabs because they seem all legs and look it is very under this damp old wharf where the rising tide is beginning to bathe the piles and one after another plants and animals are expanding they feel the refreshment of the water around them and we will move away soon we have dug few things out of the mud soon be hidden by the tide let us run the bow of our boat up on that soft black slope and see what we can ﬁnd by leaning over the side just look at this hairy object instance which has been left by the retreating waves it seems like big brown slug covered with bristles and is not very pleasant to handle but you need be afraid of it and you must be squeamish just dip up some water in that pail and rinse it till you have washed every scrap of mud from its bristly coat and then look at it in the sunlight you think it is dull and dingy now did you ever see more beautiful creature this animal is called the although really it is kind of and if you will turn back to page 429 you will ﬁnd it described the reason why its coat is always so dirty is that the bristly hairs which cover it act sort of ﬁlter and strain out the mud from the water which is passing to the gills but these hairs have another use well each one is really sort of slender spear with barbed tip the edges being set with number of sharp little points all directed backward forming capital protection from such creatures the ﬁshes great many of which would be glad to feed upon if it were not their coating of spines you see those twisted little coils of muddy sand scattered about on the mud those are the casts of lugworms which are made in the same way the casts of earthworms seen in our on damp mornings in fact these lugs are just marine earthworms see page 427 and like them eat their way down into the mud swallowing mouthful after mouthful the sake of nourishing particles in it and then voiding the useless remainder perhaps you wonder how it is that the burrows of the lugworms remain open why does the mud close in behind the animal the fact is that the worm is always pouring out from its skin sticky slime which quickly becomes quite hard and ﬁrm and this binds the sandy mud together the worm forces its way down and forms kind of lining to its burrow just like the brickwork with which we line our railway tunnels you would scarcely suspect what interesting and often beautiful worms lie buried in the mud or muddy sand of and salt marshes they occur elsewhere too upon weedy rocks while great many kinds dwell upon or within the bodies or coverings of other animals from whales to periwinkles and crabs most of the belong to the highest class of the tribe called annelids because their bodies are made up of segments little ring in latin is annellus you can easily see by examining one of the angleworms you dig in the garden bait the red lugworm or red thread it is often called is another plain example of this structure digging down by mark we are likely to unearth one or more of the worms which when they are large seem rather terrible their bodies are ﬂat so that when they swim they move through the water like ﬂoating ribbon and they have been found ﬁve or ten feet long and wide your palm such big ones are rare however and we are more likely to have to deal with one two or three feet long and less than an inch broad they are active creatures burrowing into and through the mud in search of other worms upon which they feed and which they seize by thrusting out sticky proboscis there is also smaller one pink in color while the bigger species is yellowish though we may not dig up ribbon we are pretty sure to turn out nereis or worm the ﬁshermen call reddish creature foot or two long looking like centipede there is pair of minute feet on each ring and every foot is feathered with gill this also is ravenous enemy of all other worms or animals it can overcome and 470 471 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https clams limpets starﬁsh and other protected creatures must be thankful their armor when it comes crawling near them its rich green and salmon coat has charm in their eyes you may be sure but the nereis itself must have its fears it is not only hunted by by big active annelid called four and by winkles and but is well liked by various ﬁshes and last misfortune of all it is constantly sought by ﬁshermen bait in spite of all this of all kinds remain immensely numerous all along the coast on calm summer nights they leave their burrows swim up to the surface at high tide and cast out vast numbers of eggs from which presently hatch little larvæ which swim about short time when the few that have survived settle down change to the form and burrow into the mud when we come to explore the rocky places and peer into the still pools left by the among the reefs and boulders we shall make the acquaintance of some other worms that display themselves in such places in natural aquarium iii on the rocky ledges there are practically rocks on our southeastern coast so that we must imagine ourselves now somewhere in new us say on the southern shore of rhode island all along the north side of long island sound about buzzards and narragansett bays and then from boston harbor right up to labrador the shore is rock with many headlands reefs and islets separated by shallow coves or by swift tidal runways this is good the seaside naturalist and one visit to the space left uncovered at low tide will be more than glance at what might easily keep us busy and interested whole summer through the water ebbs away the tops of the ledges and boulders emer ge like the hairy heads of some they are mostly overgrown with long tresses of brown rockweed and green ribbons of ulva which trail wet and shining down their sides step carefully it is all extremely slippery you hear that continual popping under your feet that means that you are crushing the little bladder like swellings strung like big beads on the stems of the rockweed they are ﬁlled with air and keep the long and heavy stems and leaves of the weed aﬂoat you may see if you look down where it is swishing back and forth in the lapping waves these plants must be exceedingly strong to resist the pulling and pounding of the surf in storm and their power to keep aﬂoat by means of these bladders is of assistance not only in enabling them to hold together but to form breakwater which protects the rocks and ledges they cover from being beaten to pieces by the surf underneath and upon these masses of seaweed hide great quantity and variety of small plant and animal life some of which we shall be able to ﬁnd and study though large part of it requires more thorough work than we have time and the aid of microscope but ﬁrst let us look at some of the bare places where there is seaweed here is black rock with white patches of rough little things growing upon it by the hundred they are not mollusks however but see page 407 which english boys call they are small and distant cousins of the crabs the story of these barnacles is very curious one when ﬁrst they hatch from the eggs which older barnacles have cast out into the sea they are not in the least like their parents but are queer little creatures smaller than with six feathery legs by which they paddle about one round black eye and two feelers every two or three days they throw off their skins caterpillars and appear in the new ones which have formed underneath and every time they this they change their shape so that sometimes they are round and sometimes oblong and sometimes almost triangular at last they reach their full size then they cling with their feelers to the ﬁrst rock log or other hard thing they come to and pour out drop or two of very strong cement 472 473 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https hardens around them and fastens them ﬁrmly down after this they never move again but day or two later they change their skins once more and appear perfect now look at one of them carefully through this you see that there is little hole in the top of the shell which is made of several pieces that is the hole through which the animal inside ﬁshes food if you were to watch it when the rocks are thinly covered with water you would see that it kept poking out scoop and then drawing it in again this net really consists of the hairy legs and they wave to and fro in the water they collect the tiny scraps of decaying matter on which the little creature feeds they also bear the gills by which the barnacle refreshes its blood you must be very careful not to knock your hand against these shells when you are hunting about among the rocks their edges are so sharp that they cut almost like knives another sort of barnacle you say you have found there are other strange instance which attaches itself to the bottoms of what you have found is one of the limpets and that is not crustacean but gastropod mollusk it is shaped like tiny rough mountain or rather like volcano you see there is hole in its summit and we call it the keyhole limpet on account of the shape of that hole pick it up oh you ca eh of course not pull and push hard you like you wo be able to move it nor can the heaviest waves wash it of would you like to know why well the reason is that limpet clings to rock by turning the whole lower surface of its body into one big sucker it presses it tightly against the rock and then lifts the middle part the consequence is that chamber is formed in which there is nothing at water not even air and happens when you lift brick with small leather sucker the weight of the atmosphere presses down upon it so strongly that force you can bring to bear will pull it of however limpet is not gripping the rock all the time with such vigor he would literally be tired to death and starved to death too if he did ease up most of the time it is only when he is alarmed by touch that he clamps down if you want to get him free just wait till he loosens up then hit him sudden sharp blow on one side with stick or stone and knock him off then you will be able to examine the soft body and see how he is built limpets are and when the water is still or absent they creep slowly about the rock nibbling the tiny vegetation on its surface another interesting fact in is told on page another kind of limpet is very common on those rocky shores which is shaped somewhat like loose slipper or french sabot this is the slipper or ﬁshermen call it on the lower rocks near the water and hidden in among the wet seaweeds lie many small spiral gastropods which we call periwinkles two of the commonest kinds are littorinas marked with ﬁne lines and colors in various ways another reddish with chestnut bands is named lacuna and you may pick up several kinds of small blackish ones such bittium or of ones rissoa which is prettily mottled while numerous in some places is the or purpura which is interesting because it belongs to the european shores well to ours and because from it the ancients gathered some of their purple dye although another mollusk the murex furnished most of it but in old times the coast people both of old england and new england obtained from this little mollusk an indelible violet ink with which to mark their clothes would you like to see little of this dye very well you can easily so look hold the purpura over this sheet of white paper and give the animal little poke with the head of pin there it has squirted out drop of liquid upon the paper it does not look much like purple dye does it it looks very much more like curdled milk but lay it in the sunshine and notice what happens you see it is turning yellow now blue tinge is creeping it were into the yellow 474 475 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https turning it to green the blue gets stronger and stronger till the green disappears and at last crimson tinge creeps into the blue and turns it to purple another curious thing about the purpura is the way in which it lays its eggs it fastens them down to the surface of the rock by little stalks so that they look like tiny with eggs inside them therefore when these eggs hatch several little purpura come out of each cup all the small periwinkles feed upon the algæ but with the purpura which seems to live mainly on young barnacles we come to lot of mollusks of prey we might say there are several spiral sorts mostly from one to two inches long whitish and heavily ribbed which are sometimes called but the worst one which lives by thousands on the beds of planted oysters scattered all along the shore of long island sound is known to the oystermen the drill or borer it is particularly fond of the ﬂesh of oysters and cares nothing their shells it carries in its mouth drilling instrument see page 419 by which it can bore round hole through the poor oyster armor in this way it destroys many thousands of dollars worth of valuable oysters every year it was pretty certain we should ﬁnd starﬁsh down near mark and here is ﬁne one starﬁshes are among the oddest of one reason because they have so many legs perhaps you did not know they had any legs at all certainly you can see none when you pick up dead specimen on the beach the fact is that starﬁsh keeps its legs inside its body where there are lot of organs protected by its hard limy hide and when it wants to use them it pokes them out through little holes on its under or grooved side and ﬁlls them with water you would like to see its legs doubt very well you shall this starﬁsh is still alive we can easily see that when we pick it up its rays stand stifﬂy out but if it were dead they would be quite soft and ﬂabb y and would hang down so we will put it into shallow pool of clear and see what happens there did you notice that it moved one of its rays see the one in front is being slowly pushed forward now the rays behind are being drawn up and now that they have taken fresh hold the front one is being pushed forward again the starﬁsh is really walking what will it when it comes to stone why walk over it what will it when it comes to rock why climb up it now take the starﬁsh out of the water turn it over on its back there you see on the lower surface of every ray are hundreds of little ﬂeshy objects waving about in the air those are its feet or at least its means of walking and each has sort of cup at the end which acts sucker by means of these the starﬁsh can cling tightly to the surface of stone so by using ﬁrst the little on one or two of its rays and then those on the others the starﬁsh is able to crawl about quite easily the starﬁshes live upon animal mainly other mollusks which they kill in very curious manner when in crawling about they come upon whelk or clam or oyster they creep over it and clasp it in their ﬁve arms in murderous embrace from which there is escape even if the creature can move off its captor clings to it with its hundreds of tiny suckers and rides along with it like that old man of the sea in sindbad story now if you look again at our specimen you will see on its under side small pit in the center of its body closed by ﬁve points this is the mouth and the points are sharp soon the starﬁsh has grip upon its victim the mouth opens and there is gradually pushed out strong membrane which is the creature great loose stomach this envelops the animal shell and all or much of it possible and soon begins actually to digest the ﬂesh when the meal is ﬁnished the starﬁsh draws back its stomach and leaves only the empty shell of its prey these voracious starﬁsh are worse enemy to the cultivated oysters than are the drills and having an abundance of food on the thickly planted beds they become extremely numerous so that it costs the owners of the beds much money each year to gather them off the beds by means of sort of great rake called the tangles otherwise the 476 477 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https would soon be wholly destroyed the men used simply to tear to pieces what they caught and throw them overboard again but they soon learned that this was worse than useless because each half or even single arm would not only go on living but would reproduce all the missing parts so that in trying to kill one starﬁsh they had brought to life two or perhaps even ﬁve which was very discouraging nowadays therefore all captured starﬁshes are brought ashore and left there and often are made use of by being ground up with oyster into an excellent fertilizer what is that object covered all over with spikes it is clinging in little hollow of the rock half hidden in seaweed of the same color ah that is and although it looks so very unlike them it is really kind of ﬁrst cousin to the starﬁshes here is dead one from which the spines have been knocked off just look at it carefully and you will see that it is very much like starﬁsh rolled up into ball see you can trace the ﬁve rays quite easily and if you look at it through strong you will ﬁnd that its surface is pierced in hundreds of places with tiny holes through which it can poke out little sucker just the starﬁshes look again at the shell from which the spines have been knocked away you see that it is covered all over with little pimples now on every one of these pimples spine was fastened by kind of joint the pimple being the ball and the socket lying inside the base of the spine and by means of special muscles the anim al could move the spines about just though it were kind of hedgehog in fact this is the reason why it is called urchin is an old name hedgehog so when crawls about it does so partly with its sucker and partly with its spines well sometimes however these creatures use their sucker quite different purpose they poke them out far they can from among their spines and then take hold of little stones small pieces of broken shell and other bits of rubbish which they ﬁnd at the bottom of the sea and cling to them very tightly the consequence is that you can not see the animal at all it is quite concealed by this curious covering and unless you were to take it out of the water you would never have the least idea what it really was now look at the mouth of this spiky you will ﬁnd it in the very middle of the lower part of the body you see what great teeth it has there are ﬁve of them arranged in circle in the mouth of starﬁsh and they are made in just the same way the front teeth of rat or rabbit that is they never stop growing all through the life of the animal so that fast they are worn away from above they are pushed up from below and thus always keep just the proper length and sharpness are rather few and small along the shores of southern new england but more numerous northward and on rocky bottoms offshore on the offshore bottom there lives also queer sort whose shells are often cast up and are well known to the children these are about the size and shape of one of mother cookies and are covered with stiff brown fur of short spines on one under the little mouth and around it the faint outlines of ﬁve radiating arms each sketched it were by double row of where the almost invisible feet are pushed out these are creeping about at the bottom in myriads where the water is few fathoms deep and storms cast up thousands upon the beaches or into the where very likely we may ﬁnd some in the course of our next visit to the iv between we must start early on our walk today soon the tide falls away from the piece of rocky shore we have in mind so that we may have plenty of time the ﬁeld which we 478 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https left until the last is the richest the seaside naturalist has to explore the sea sinks away it uncovers not only the weedy ledges which we studied the other day but also spaces between them of low rocks and loose stones half sunk in mud and sand there is much to interest the botanist too but he will have to look out himself we have more than enough to to look after the animals many dead shells are lying about showing the various species of which inhabit this shore or the waters of the ofﬁng some of them we already know and others we can never expect to get alive except by dredging such are the scallops which rarely come up far mark in spite of their wandering habits and the jingleshells or goldshells although these like the young oysters to which they are closely related may usually be found clinging to stones where they seem swollen scales or blisters of thin amber or horn there is us examine it we ca pick it off or even pry it off but when we slip slowly beneath it it comes loose and we discover that this queer creature is bivalve mollusk looking and tasting like an oyster and with small ﬂat shell underneath the bulging top one in this undershell is large hole through which passes stout stony stalk which anchors this creature ﬁrmly an oyster is ﬁxed by the cementing of its undershell to whatever it has attached itself when young the jingleshells are extremely numerous all along the coast south of cape cod wherever the water is more than about seventy feet deep especially in long island sound and the oystermen gather them from the beaches and from their dredgings and scatter their shells over the ﬂoor of the sound seats young oysters they are especially useful this purpose because they are so slight and brittle that when often happens two or three minute oyster æ settle down on one of these shells they will they grow break it apart by the strain and then each oyster relieved from the crowding of its mates will form round nicely shaped shell instead of narrow or misshapen one and consequently be more valuable when it comes to be dredged up after couple of years or so and of fered sale this rough space between is ﬁne place crabs we have seen some of these creatures already elsewhere and our book see chapter xxxv has already instructed us to the general characteristics of crustaceans here scrambling about the ledges just under water are big rock and jonah crabs but not so many of them you might see in maine both are eaten when but are not so good the blue crab here too are lively and pugnacious ﬁddlers and some green or stone crabs wonderfully active little creatures which in england are sent to market but on this side of the ocean are used only bait still more comical and interesting is one of the spider which may be called thornback it has little body but very long legs so that big male thornback might cover eighteen inches in the stretch of its legs you see how long his great claws are and how his back is covered all over with tiny hooked spines it is quite easy to understand why the name of thornback was given to him but how is it that all those tufts of seaweed are growing on the upper part of the shell well the answer is very odd one the crab planted them there himself the fact is that when he is lying down at the bottom of pool he does not want to be seen fear that the animals upon which he preys should take alarm and escape before he can catch them so he actually pulls up number of little sprigs of seaweed and plants them on his back one after the other pressing the roots down with his claws till at last they are held quite ﬁrmly by the little hooked spines with which his shell is covered then long he keeps quite still he is perfectly invisible and his victims may even crawl over him without suspecting that they are in any danger stranger still if thornback crab which has covered his back with seaweeds should be placed in tank in which sponges are growing he will soon ﬁnd out that he is not nearly so well hidden he would like to be and will get very uneasy befor long he will discover what the reason is and will actually pull all the sea weed off his shell and plant sponges on it instead 479 480 481 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https too scampering and rattling about among the pebbles are lots of dragging after them the shells in which they have ensconced their soft hind bodies is described on page and under the them over and you will dozens of strange little creatures which you might easily believe were insects but which really are diminutive cousins of the crabs and crayﬁsh named amphipods and isopods and so forth you may ﬁnd under some stone one of the tubes made by certain species composed of grains of sand glued together by stick y threads much like spiders silk these minute crustaceans exist in vast multitudes near the surface of the ocean at certain seasons and form the principal food of the which gulp them down wholesale some of them also are parasitic on ﬁshes but what is the curious little creature clinging ﬂat upon this rock among the weeds it looks like some sort of half an inch long does it ah that is chiton it is really kind of mollusk like the whelk and the periwinkle only instead of having its shell made all in one piece it has eight shelly plates on its back which overlap one another just like the slates on the roof of house just touch it with your ﬁnger there you see it has rolled itself up into ball just like those which you may ﬁnd in the garden it always does this if it is frightened and its shell is so stout and hard that long it is rolled up it is quite safe from nearly all its enemies if you were to hunt about among the rocks quite close to the water edge when the tide is at its lowest you would most likely meet with number of chitons and you would be surprised to ﬁnd how much they vary in color some are ashy gray all over but great many are streaked and spotted with brown and pink and orange and lilac and white but the strangest thing of all about are far larger ones in the warmer parts of the that some of them have nearly twelve thousand eyes scattered about all over their shells but we are lingering too long by the way our real destination is that ﬁne pool over there it is basin among the ledges ﬁlled with quiet left by the retreat of the tide with sandy mud and its edges fringed with feathery seaweeds corallines and hydroids here is capital home the little folk of the sea where there is always fresh clear water but where only part of the time the surges pound and then never with full force furthermore wall of rocks protects the nook and enemies can rarely enter to destroy the peaceful society in warmer parts of the coast in the gulf of mexico or upon the paciﬁc coast or most of all in some of the tropical islands which now belong to the united states such pool would be brilliantly carpeted with sponges and corallines of which you may read on pages 431 to the water of the north atlantic and the winters of its american coast are too cold however to allow any but very few hardy species of these lowly s to grow in our pool but there are quite enough to keep us busy during the hour or two left before the returning tide creeps over the jagged rim of the basin and drives us away here instance is half an oyster looking if it had been bored full of holes with it could hardly have been any boy target though see we can ﬁnd many such fragments there is one under water take it out and you will ﬁnd every one of the hundreds of little pits ﬁlled with yellow spongy material it is real sponge called the because it riddles all sorts of old shells until they fall to pieces this is good thing then they are gradually ground to powder and dissolved in the water and so help to keep it supplied with the lime needed by living animals their shells but other sponges help in this work one is brilliant crimson and spreads velvety mantle over the shell from which rise branches big your ﬁngers we may probably discover among others here the pretty like clusters of yellow or gray goblets about half an inch high on the reefs of the gulf coast of florida you know several sorts of sponges grow to great size and are gathered and prepared trade which furnishes employment to hundreds of men but this clear pool holds more beautiful things than sponges if we are fortunate we may ﬁnd not fancy from its name that it looks anything like the pretty 482 483 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https and white anemones that delight you in the woods in the spring it does indeed look something like or some sorts of chrysanthemum when it is fully expanded yet it is not ﬂower at all but true animal its body is shaped like barrel or sometimes more like tube with large throat leading into big stomach which is held in position in the center of the body by six partitions radiating like the spokes of wheel from the stomach to the tough outer skin between these are other shorter partitions extending inward from the skin but not reaching the stomach this is the type of structure in the polyp family which the represent and the stony are built on the same plan only there the outer wall and the radiating inside partitions become hardened plates of lime the animal grows and form when many grow into solid mass the immense coral reefs described on page the new england coast has several small and one handsome one sometimes big teacup few of which dwell in our pool just come very quietly over to this side and gaze down through the clear water upon that reddish block of stone you not see that large brown tuft quivering and moving like chrysanthemum each petal of which was alive that is the brown but some specimens show much brighter tints ah you notice how that minnow turned and fairly ﬂew he felt touch of one of those waving petals wonder he was in such hurry to escape from its clutches since he knew quite well that the grasp of those arms means death every one of them is set with scores and scores of tiny oval cells made in such way that they spring open at the slightest touch and inside each cell is slender poisoned dart which leaps out soon it is opened so if the minnow had waited few minutes longer hundreds of these little darts would have buried themselves in the soft parts of his body and stung him to death and then the anemone would have swallowed him now just touch the anemone with the tip of your ﬁnger you need not be afraid to so its little poisoned darts are not nearly strong enough to pierce your skin there you see how its arms at once come closing in it seems to be pushing them right down into the very middle of its body now they have entirely disappeared and you can not see them at all the animal looks just like shapeless lump of jelly yes it always does that when it is frightened and also if it is left high and dry when the tide goes out and when it catches victim and swallows it it generally remains closed up at least couple of days now let us tell you another curious thing about the anemone it looks if it were growing out of the rock does it if you try to push it loose you will probably kill it before you succeed yet it can release it sucker grip and move about if it wishes to this is only one of many very interesting things to be learned about these lovely creatures and here is another very beautiful thing which you must not miss one would think the dark rock under the water had blossomed out into small bed of ﬁlmy bluish pinks only what you see is even more delicate and feathery that is patch of true corals and it is most fortunate it was found here it is rarely seen except when brought up in dredge from water several fathoms deep now let us see whether we can not ﬁnd some of the which in feathery beauty are rivals of even the anemones and look down to the very bottom of the pool you see that bunch of long twisted tubes which seem to be fastened to one of those big stones they are made by very common called the serpula or they are quite often found attached to shells to stones this worm never leaves the tube it forms about it out of the limy mucus thrown out of its skin so that it has use feet consequently these have beco simply row of bristles along its sides by which the animal can hitch itself up and down or forward and backward within its case sometimes it may want to draw itself back into its tube very quickly to save its head 484 485 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https bitten off by some ﬁsh or ravenou s worm so along its back it has row of between thirteen and fourteen thousand little hooked teeth with which it can take ﬁrm hold of the lining of its tunnel and if it is suddenly alarmed it just raises these teeth and then jerks itself back into its tunnel with such wonderful speed that you can scarcely see what has become of it now let us lift the bundle of tubes out of the water and examine them little more closely you see that each one is closed just little way below the entrance by kind of scarlet stopper that shows that the worm inside is alive the stopper is shaped just like tiny cork and whenever the serpula retreats into its tube it pulls this odd little stopper in after it and so prevents any of its enemies from getting in and devouring it just gastropods close the aperture of their shells with the operculum if you were to put this bunch of tubes back into the water and watch it carefully an hour or so you would most likely see all the stoppers come out one after another and few moments later you would see bright scarlet tuft projecting out of the mouth of each tube these tufts are the gills by means of which the serpulas breathe but at the slightest alarm the tufts would all disappear and in less than second every tube would be tightly corked up again just before on the gulf coast of florida and throughout the west indies lives larger relative of the serpula called which secretes its tube upon the surface of large heads so that the tube becomes covered by the coral leaving the opening still at the surface this opening says mayer is protected by sharp spine and is closed by the operculum of the worm when it withdraws its gills when expanded these gills resemble beautiful pink or purple about of an inch wide in such pools and in the mud among the stones near mark lie buried several kinds of worms which poke their heads up into the water above them when the tide comes in and expand tufts of pink or crimson or yellow gills and tentacles the latter used to catch minute ﬂoating inly the microscopic larvæ of various mollusks worms also in some cases to drag to them the grains of sand out of which they construct their tubes one of these is the fringed worm cirratulus whose gills are like long threads and another the similar polycirrus whose great cluster of crimson tentacles about the mouth looks like clot of blood on the sand more often turned out by the naturalist spade however is the tufted worm amphitrite which dwells in house made by itself by taking number of grains of sand and sticking them together by means of kind of glue which it pours out of its mouth and which very soon sets and becomes quite hard even though it is under water this glue is so tough and strong that you can take the tube and give it quite smart pull without tearing or hurting it in the least and when the tube is ﬁnished amphitrite makes that little fringe round the entrance by taking number of very tiny grains and fastening them together in the form of threads there is one in this nook of our pool now and you may see the three pairs of red tentacles which with many pale yellow ones the worm has thrust out into the clear water breathing by means of some the gills and with the others capturing the invisible creatures upon which it mainly feeds the tubes of these worms usually run several inches down into the sandy mud at the bottom of the pool and are often carried down under the rocks or big stones so you will not ﬁnd it very easy to dig them up and if you startle amphitrite herself she will always wriggle at once down to the very bottom of her tubular fortress there our four rambles are over and although we have met with great many interesting creatures we have not seen nearly all that there is to be seen either on the beach or in the mud or on the rocks or in the pools which lie among them but all the curiosities of the seashore may be found by those who have patience and know how to use their eyes 486 487 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https wicked waste of life plea to women consistency one of the most puzzling things in life is why almost all our mothers and sisters and aunts and dear teachers continue to trim their hats with feathers they give their boys and girls books about birds and teach love of nature in the schools and sing and march on bird day and pay money to missionaries to convert south sea islanders from wearing feather and then go and buy to deck their own heads this confuses the boys and girls good deal how they ask can mother preach against cruelty and vanity to her children when she continues to load her hat and theirs with feathers every one of which represents crime against the laws of both god and man the reason why lawmakers ﬁnd it so difﬁcult to enforce protective legislation is that the women demand dead birds careless whether of useful species or not matter by what gory slaughter and violated laws obtained ministers to their the law be hanged they will even wear these evidences of cruelty and crime to church and listen unabashed to exhortations and prayers which others think ought to shrivel them with shame recent writer in hampton magazine describes his impressions of scene of this kind in chicago church whose preacher that morning had chosen christian gentleness his theme this writer indulgently believes that the listeners did not know at what cost not in life alone but in hard dollars and cents they and other persons equally careless and equally reckless were securing the transient satisfaction of their immediate desires and he expresses himself equally sure that if they did know they would never again appear in public so savagely adorned we are sorry to be obliged to disagree with him if they not know it is because they not read and listen and few american women gentle or simple are chargeable with negligence in that respect the ofﬁcers of the audubon societies who have been laboring years vigorously they know how tell us there is lack of information but that in general women care and ca be made to care what irds cost either themselves or the country so long they are in style apparently the only way to stop the ruin of our is the general government to prohibit absolutely both import and export of any kind of or feathers except of the ostrich intended or liable to be used in millinery and the states to stamp out dealing in feather trimmings by prohibitive licensing tax appeals to the women are useless the only way is to attack the trade nevertheless let us make one more effort here are four cardinal facts instance relating to the aigrettes or ospreys which you covet showing what they cost 1 aigrettes are produced only by white herons and only during the season therefore 2 the parent birds must be shot in order to obtain the plum es hence 3 the young birds in the nests must starve in consequence of the death of the parents consequently 4 all statements that the plumes are manufactured or are gathered after being molted by the adult birds are false here is picture of how they are got and it can be veriﬁed by photographs notwithstanding the extreme heat and the myriads of mosquitos i determined to revisit the locality during my holidays in order to obtain one picture that of white crane or egret feeding its young when near the place i could see some large patches of white either ﬂoating in the water or reclining on the fallen trees in the vicinity of the egrets rookery this set specu lating to the cause of this unusual sight i drew nearer what spectacle met my sight that made my blood fairly boil with indignation there strewn on the ﬂoating water and also on adjacent logs were at least ﬁfty carcasses of large white and smaller plumed ird of the rookery perhaps birds having been shot off their nests containin g young what holocaust plundered their plumes what monument of human callousness 488 489 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https were ﬁfty birds ruthlessly destroy ed besides their young about two hundred left to die of starvation this last fact was betokened by at least seventy carcass es of the nestlings which had become so weak that their legs had refused to support them and they had fallen from the nests into the water below and had been miserably drowned while in the trees above the remainder of the parentless young ones could be seen staggering in the nests some of them falling with splash into the water their waning strength left them too exhausted to hold up any longer while others simply stretched themselves out on the nest and so expired others again were seen trying in vain to attract the attention of passing egrets which were ﬂying with food in their bills to feed their own young and it was pitiful sight indeed to see these starveli ngs with outstretched necks and gaping bills imploring the passing birds to feed them what sickening sight like gruesome story is given by william finley agent of the national association of audubon societies after he had explored the region about lake malheur oregon where formerly thousands of white herons bred but now none are to be all absolutely exterminated by in florida an agent of this association was lately murdered while trying to defend rookery from every almost every other feather you broken law and in buying it you become voluntary partner in crime the manufacturing milliners and dealers realize this and consequently resort to all sorts of lies and disguises and subterfuges which your buying encourages it sustains the bloody business of the illegal feather some dealers assert that none but imported feathers are now sold by them this is not true but if it were the wearing of them is wrong not only because it enco urages the devastation of other countries but also because it keeps up the general fashion the same may be said in answer to the plea of the milliner that her ornaments were made up of you ca be sure of that and you are setting harmful example here of course remarks reginald kauf fman in the illuminative hampton article already quoted is involved merely question of individual ethics but if the triﬂing life of bird is matter of smal l moment even to the gentler long the eyes of that sex are not outraged by an actual sight of the bloody least matter of very great moment is the fact that the rise in the price of your foodstuf fs the yearly increase in your is the direct result of those feathers in your bonnet those plumes upon your daughter hat difﬁcult the ﬁgures are to get such may be acquired are appalling surely you can not read them and remain unmoved england by importing the bird of paradise at the rate of six thousand year has practically exterminated that species in four months one london house disposed of eight hundred thousand east and west indian skins the united states alone sends to the british isles four hundred thousand every twelve months which helps bring the english grand total up to thirty million birds year and we keep comfortable ﬁgure home consumption in one year single chicago dealer has been known to handle in one consignment gulls and the wings of other birds in all the national audubon association puts our total at about birds year the european continent repeats this and so you have the women of the world with the omission of our south american cousins wearing birds every year legislation is here always powerless in the face of fashionable womankind another point of view is that of good taste single large feather or shapely in themselves beautiful objects and well adapted to decorative be so applied really to adorn lady hat or man that matter very pleasingly and if it is the trophy of the skill of some friend obtained in fair sport it may embody delightful sentiment well it was in this simple wasteful and unobjectio nable manner that feathers were originally employed trimmings but ﬁerce trade competition among milliners catering to the foolish cry novelties regardless of becomingness in any 490 491 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https has developed absurdities of which often make their wearers utterly ridiculous what possible justiﬁcation in art or common sense is there in setting dead anim al on hat if any can be found surely the efﬁgy should be lifelike and not some horrible travesty if ribbons and ﬂowers are not enough ornaments to set off pretty faces why not wind shining about the crow n of the hat or utilize our resplendent moths and beetles trimmings they are elegant in form and color varied preservable and by means costly moreover the general destruction which would follow the entry of such fashion would reduce the insect enemi es of our crops and t women seem to care nothing about that aspect of the case the insects kill the crops remarks kauf fman the birds kill the insects and the most part in order to trim your hats the birds study of the government reports will show that crop losses from insects are rarely less than 10 per cent and sometimes high 50 we may now turn to another phase of our waste of game animals and other useful or beautiful creatures when europeans ﬁrst came to this continent the bison and elk roamed everywhere west of the blue ridge by the middle of the nineteenth century all had disappe ared east of the great plains completely had the salmon which used to throng in our eastern rivers and here few years later both were almost utterly destroyed by wretched hunters the moose elk antelope mountain sheep and goats beaver and many other game and fur animals of north america have also suffered so terribly under relentless persecution that they now are found only in small numbers in very remote places the of which at the beginning of the nineteenth century more than were killed every year has become so scarce that its coat in good condition is now worth to the hunter the horrible stories of the butchery of the and the passenger need not be recited the building up of great cities made market game and ﬁsh and coincident therewith the and the came into existence under these conditions the destruction went on merrily until in the early eighties observant sportsmen and naturalists began to realize that extermination threatened such the the quail the ruffed grouse the the canvasback duck and even the mallard and teal coincident with this great hegira to the woods we are told by shields in late number of collier weekly there appeared on the scene type of man that has become known and recognized everywhere the american this depraved creature developed fondness killing every living thing he could ﬁnd whether edible or not or whether he needed it food or not all he cared was to kill kill kill he loved to stop beautiful animal in its ﬂight and put it to death or to see bird double up in the air and fall with through its body the competition became so strong between these that they got to challenging one another to combats in the ﬁeld and contests were arranged weeks ahead large stakes being deposited on the result the became feature of many rural districts is it any wonder then that decent men came to rebel against this savage slaughter good sportsmen naturalists and laymen became so disgusted with it that they went before their legislatures and demanded that it be stopped laws were accordingly enacted in many states and recently legislation the preservation of the game has become science and few men are devoting their best thought and their best ener gies to it but the and the bid deﬁance to all written and unwritten state employs enough to police all of its territory so the ravaging of the wild went on 492 the project gutenberg ebook of the animal world by theodore wood https the correction of this evil one has contributed more energetically than shields and some other editors of periodicals devoted to and recreat ion they have given the so disgraceful notoriety and have brought down upon his head such scorn from decent sportsmen that he has been lar gely suppressed here too mothers wives and sisters are largely at fault but they may plead ignorance much more plausibly than in the case of their own sins of why should they applaud useless slaughter dictated by vanity and in the men over whom they have inﬂuence is it manly or an admirable thing these ignorant and thoughtless women have still time to repent and force their folks to behave like gentlemen there is still game enough to bring about revival of plenty all reasonable sportsmen of the next generation well this there are laws enough too to protect it but between the ignorance of the legislators and their fear of offending the very against whom the laws are directed who unfortunately have votes they will not appropriate the money necessary to provide rdens and other means of enforcing the laws properly here is where the inﬂuence of every minded woman and patriotic man can be tellingly exerted show the lawmakers that the good opinion of the decent half of the community is better worth having than that of the meaner half and see that your are not in the latter class when you have done this let your boys understand the position they must take on this subject if they wish to be regarded true sportsmen not to say gentlem en their training should begin early little boys are fond of forked stick or crutch with rubber band hurling bean or pebble insist that they not use it knocking over birds all boys also pass through season of collecting specimens when they are enthusiastic toward preparing cabinet of natural history encourage them to so but without taking life or robbing birds nests give them an instead of shotgun show them how they can learn more and get more amusement by watching the bird family in its home than by arranging dead shells on string or in box watch the birds yourself while and then see how you feel about your hat there is scientiﬁc need or excuse nowadays private collections of the skins or eggs of birds and the stopping of all is of the utmost importance the same reasons the stoppage of millinery murder and both are the immediate duty of all parents nor must there be forgotten in considering this matter the disastrous effect of recklessness to waste and suffering on the mind of the the and the cruelty can not be practiced without crushing and blighting the best insects burns says it hardens within and petriﬁes the feeling child that is cruel to animals disdainful of their sufferings when in pursuit of his pleasure can not be trusted to be kind to younger sister weaker companion or valued pet cruelty is vice of the basest and most mark of the savage and criminal let the mother remember this not only in her precepts but in the example she gives her children
