atticus 138 every lover is soldier the age which is ﬁtted war is suited to love well an old man to be soldier is shocking amorousness in an old man is shocking the years which 139 generals require in the valiant soldier the same does the charming fair require in her husband both soldier and lover pass sleepless nights both rest upon the ground the one watches at the door of his mistress but the other at that of his general 140 long marches are the duty of the soldier send the fair far away and the lover will boldly follow her without limit to his endurance over opposing mountains will he go and rivers swollen with rains the accumulating snows will he pace about to plough the waves he will not reproach the stormy east winds nor will he watch constellations favourable scudding over the waves who except either the soldier or the lover will submit to both the chill of the night and the snows mingled with the heavy showers the one is sent spy against the hostile foe the other keeps his eye on his rival though upon an enemy the one lays siege to stubborn cities the other to the threshold of his obdurate mistress the one bursts open gates and the other doors 142 full oft has it answered to attack the enemy when buried in sleep and to slaughter an unarmed multitude with armed hand thus did the ﬁerce troops of the thracian rhesus 143 fall and you captured steeds forsook your lord full oft lovers take advantage of the sleep of husbands and brandish their arms against the slumbering foe to escape the troops of the sentinels and the bands of the patrol is the part both of the soldier and of the lover always in misery mars is wayward and venus is uncertain both the conquered rise again and those fall whom you would say could never possibly be prostrate whoever then has

paramour concealed in his white feathers deceived under the form of ﬁctitious bird such amymone 152 used to wander in the parched ﬁelds of argos when the urn was pressing the locks on the top of her head such were you and i was in dread of both the eagle and the bull with respect to you and whatever form besides love has created of the mighty jove now all fears are gone and the disease of my mind is cured and now longer does that form of yours rivet my eyes you inquire why i am changed it is because you require presents this reason does not allow of your pleasing so long you were disinterested i was in love with your mind together with your person now in my estimation your appearance is affected by this blemish on your disposition love is both child and naked he has years without sordidness and he wears clothes that he may be without concealment why you require the son of venus to be prostituted at price he has fold in his dress 153 in which to conceal that price neither venus is suited cruel arms nor yet the son of venus it beﬁts not such unwarlike divinities to serve pay the courtesan stands hire to any one at certain price and with her submissive body she seeks wretched pelf still

kindred impulse witnesses hired dishonestly 156 sell their perjuries the chest 157 of the commissioned judge 158 is disgracefully open the bribe is dishonourable thing to defend the wretched criminals with tongue that is purchased 159 is disgrace tribunal to make great acquisitions is disgrace woman to increase her patrimonial possessions by the proﬁts of her embraces and to prostitute her beauty lucre thanks are justly due things obtained without purchase there are thanks an intercourse disgracefully bartered he who hires 160 pays all his due the price once paid he longer remains debtor your acquiescence cease ye beauties to bargain pay your favours sordid gains bring good results it was not worth her while to bargain the sabine bracelets 161 in order that the arms should crush the head of the sacred maiden the son pierced 163 with the sword those entrails from which he had sprung and simple necklace 164 was the cause of the punishment but yet it is not unbecoming present to be asked

senators magistrates and knights the emperors were not very scrupulous on whom they conferred the privilege of wearing the gold ring and severus and aurelian gave the right to all roman soldiers vain persons who had the privilege literally covered their ﬁngers with rings so much so that quintilian thinks it necessary to warn the orator not to have them above the middle joint of the ﬁngers the

imparted stimulus to my geuius it has been supposed by some commentators that under this name he meant julia either the daughter or the of the emperor augustus but there seems really to be ground such belief indeed the daughter of augustus had passed middle age when ovid was still in boyhood it is most probable that corinna was ouly an ideal personage existing in the imagination of the poet and that he intended the name to apply to his favourite mistress the time being though he occasionally denies it still at other times he admits that his passion was of the roving kind there are two

poet possibly alludes or else to the asp which was common in the north of egypt and perhaps was looked upon sacred if so it is probable that the word refers to the drowsy effect produced by the sting

fourth book being then dead macer was native of verona and was the intimate friend of virgil ovid and tibullus some suppose that the poet who wrote on natural history was not the same with him who
