shook the reins nearer to night than day and led the light along the slope that down before him lay claudius began to breathe his last and could not make an end of the matter then mercury who had always been much pleased with his wit drew aside one of the three fates and said cruel beldame why you let the poor wretch be tormented after all this torture can not he have rest four and sixty years it is now since he began to pant breath what grudge is this you bear against him and the whole empire let the astrologers tell the truth once since he became emperor they have never let year pass never month without laying him out his burial yet it is wonder if they are wrong and one knows his hour nobody ever believed he was really quite born 1 what has to be done kill him and let better man rule in empty court clotho replied upon my word i did wish to give him another hour or two until he should make roman citizens of the half dozen who are still outsiders he made up his mind you know to

pocket claudius they tell everybody to speed him on his way with cries of joy and solemn litany at once he bubbled up the ghost and there was an end to that shadow of life he was listening to troupe of comedians when he died so you see i have reason to fear those gentry the last words he was heard to speak in this world were these when he had made great noise with that end of him which talked easiest he cried out oh dear oh dear i think i have made mess of myself whether he did or i can not say but certain it is he always did make mess of everything what happened next on earth it is mere waste of time to tell you know it all well enough and there is fear of your ever getting the impression which that public rejoicing made on your memory one gets his own happiness what happened in heaven you shall hear proof please apply to my informant word comes to jupiter that stranger had arrived man well set up pretty grey he seemed to be threatening something he wagged his head ceaselessly he dragged the right foot they asked him what nation he was of he answered something in confused mumbling voice his language they did not understand he was greek and roman nor of any known race on this jupiter bids hercules go and ﬁnd out what country he comes from you see hercules had travelled over the whole world and might be expected to know all the nations in it but hercules the ﬁrst glimpse he got was really much taken aback although not all the monsters in the world could frighten him when he saw this new kind of object with its extraordinary gait and the voice of terrestrial beast but such you might hear in the leviathans of the deep hoarse and inarticulate he thought his thirteenth labour had come upon him when he looked closer the thing seemed to be kind of man up he goes then and says what your greek ﬁnds readiest to his tongue who art thou and what thy people who thy parents where thy home claudius was delighted to ﬁnd literary men up there and began to hope there might be some corner his own historical works so he caps him with another homeric verse explaining that he was caesar breezes wafted from ilion unto the ciconian land but the next verse was more true and less homeric thither come i sacked city slew the people every one he would have taken in poor simple hercules but that our lady of malaria was there who left her temple and came alone with him all the other gods he had left at rome quoth she the fellow tale is nothing but lies i have lived with him all these years and i tell you he was born at l yons you behold gess of marcus 3 i say he was born at the sixteenth milestone from vienne native gaul so of course he took rome good gaul ought to i pledge you my word that in l yons he was born where licinus 4 was king so many years but you that have trudged over more roads than any muleteer that plies hire you must have come across the people of l yons and you must know that it is far cry from xanthus to the rhone at this point claudius ﬂared up and expressed his wrath with big growl he could manage what he said nobody understood matter of fact he was ordering my lady of fever to be taken away and making that sign with his trembling hand which was always steady enough that if nothing else by which he used to decapitate men he had ordered her head to be chopped of all the notice the others took of him they might have been his own od i 17 od ix 39 6 apocolocyntosis project gutenberg https hercules said y just listen to and stop playing the fool you have come to the place where the mice nibble iron 5 out with the truth and look sharp or i knock your quips and quiddities out of you then to make himself all the more awful he strikes an attitude and proceeds in his most tragic vein declare with speed what spot you claim by birth or with this club fall stricken to the earth this club hath ofttimes slaughtered haughty kings why mumble unintelligible things what land what tribe produced that shaking head declare it on my journey when i sped far to the kingdom of the triple king and from the main hesperian did bring the goodly cattle to the argive town there i beheld mountain looking down upon two rivers this the sun espies right opposite each day he doth arise hence mighty rhone thy rapid torrents ﬂow and arar much in doubt which way to go ripples along the banks with shallow roll say is this land the nurse that bred thy soul these lines he delivered with much spirit and bold front all the same he was not quite master of his wits and had some fear of blow from the fool claudius seeing mighty man before him saw things looked serious and understood that here he had not quite the same at rome where one was his equal the gallic cock was worth most on his own dunghill so this is what he was thought to say far could be made out i did hope hercules bravest of all the gods that you would take my part with the rest and if i should need voucher i meant to name you who know so well but call it to mind how it was i used to sit in judgment before your temple whole days together during july and august you know what miseries i endured there in hearing the lawyers plead day and night if you had fallen amongst these you may think yourself very strong but you would have found it worse than the sewers of augeas i drained out more ﬁlth than you did but since i want some pages have fallen out in which hercules must have been persuaded the gods are now discussing what hercules tells them wonder you have forced your way into the senate house bars or bolts can hold against you only say what species of god you want the fellow to be made an epicurean god he can not be they have troubles and cause none stoic then how can he be globular varro says without head or any other projection there is in him something of the stoic god i can see now he has neither heart nor head upon my word if he had asked this boon from saturn he would not have got it though he kept up saturn feast all the year round truly saturnalian prince likely thing he will get it from jove whom he condemned incest far in him lay he killed his law silanus because silanus had sister most charming girl called venus by all the world and he preferred to call her juno why says he i want to know why his own sister read your books stupid you may go at athens the whole way at alexandria because the mice lick meal at rome you say is this creature to mend our crooked ways what goes on in his own closet he knows not 6 and now he searches the regions of the sky wants to be god is it not enough that he has temple in britain that savages worship him and pray to him god so that they may ﬁnd fool 7 to have mercy upon them at last it came into jove head that while strangers were in the house it was not lawful to speak or debate my lords and gentlemen said he i gave you leave to ask questions and you have made regular farmyard 8 of the place be so good to keep8 apocolocyntosis project gutenberg https rules of the house what will this person think of us whoever he is so claudius was led out and the ﬁrst to be asked his opinion was father janus he had been made consul elect the afternoon of the next ﬁrst of july 9 being shrewd man you could ﬁnd on summer day he could see they say before and behind 10 he made an eloquent harangue because his life was passed in the forum but too fast the notary to take down that is why i give full report of it i want to change the words he used he said great deal of the majesty of the gods and how the honour ought not to be given away to every tom dick or harry once said he it was great thing to become god now you have made it farce therefore that you may not think i am speaking against one person instead of the general custom i propose that from this day forward the godhead be given to none of those who eat the fruits of the earth or whom mother earth doth nourish after this bill has been read third time whosoever is made said or portrayed to be god i vote he be delivered over to the bogies and at the next public show be ﬂogged with birch amongst the new gladiators the next to be asked was diespiter son of vica pota he also being consul elect and moneylender by this trade he made living used to sell rights of citizenship in small way hercules trips up to him daintily and tweaks him by the ear so he uttered his opinion in these words inasmuch the blessed claudius is akin to the blessed augustus and also to the blessed augusta his grandmother whom he ordered to be made goddess and whereas he far surpasses all mortal men in wisdom and seeing that it is the public good that there be some one able to join romulus in devouring boiled turnips i propose that from this day forth blessed claudius be god to enjoy that honour with all its appurtenances in full degree any other before him and that note to that ef fect be added to ovid metamorphoses the meeting was divided and it looked though claudius was to win the day hercules saw his iron was in the ﬁre trotted here and trotted there saying deny i make point of the matter i much you again when you like you roll my log and i roll yours one hand washes another then arose the blessed augustus when his turn came and spoke with much eloquence 11 i call you to witness my lords and gentlemen said he that since the day i was made god i have never uttered one word i always mind my own business but now i can keep on the mask longer nor conceal the sorrow which shame makes all the greater is it this i have made peace by land and sea this have i calmed intestine wars this laid ﬁrm foundation of law rome adorned it with buildings and all that my lords words fail there are none can rise to the height of my indignation i must borrow that saying of the eloquent messala corvinus i am ashamed of my authority 12 this man my lords who looks though he could not hurt ﬂy used to chop of f heads easily dog sits down but why should i speak of all those men and such men there is time to lament public disasters when one has so many private sorrows to think of i leave that therefore and say only this even if my sister knows greek i the knee is nearer than the shin 13 this man you see who so many years has been masquerading under my name has done the favour of murdering two julias of mine one by cold steel and one by starvation and one great grandson silanus see jupiter whether he had case against him at least it is your own if you will be fair come tell blessed claudius why of all those you killed both men and women without hearing why you did not hear their side of the case ﬁrst before putting them to death where we ﬁnd that custom it is not done in heaven look at jupiter all these years he has been king and never did more than once to break vulcan leg seizing by the foot he cast from the threshold of the sky and once he fell in rage with his wife and strung her up did he any killing you killed messalina whose i was less than yours i know did you say curse you that is just it not to know was worse than to kill caligula he went on persecuting even when he was dead caligula murdered his father claudius his to boot caligula would not have crassus son called great claudius gave him his name back and took away his head in one family he destroyed crassus 11 illiad i apocolocyntosis project gutenberg https the tristionias assario noble though they were crassus indeed such fool that he might have been emperor is this he you want now to make god look at his body born under the wrath of heaven in ﬁne let him say the three words 14 quickly and he may have slave god who will worship this god who will believe in him while you make gods of such he one will believe you to be gods to be brief my lords if i have lived honourably among you if i have never given plain speech to any avenge my wrongs this is my motion then he read out his amendment which he had committed to writing inasmuch the blessed claudius murdered his father appius silanus his two pompeius magnus and silanus crassus frugi his daughter father like him two eggs in basket scribonia his daughter mother his wife messalina and others too numerous to mention i propose that strong measures be taken against him that he be allowed delay of process that immediate sentence of banishment be passed on him that he be deported from heaven within thirty days and from olympus within thirty hours this motion was passed without further debate not moment was lost mercury screwed his neck and haled him to the lower regions to that bourne from which they say traveller returns 15 they passed downwards along the sacred way mercury asked what was that great concourse of men could it be claudius funeral it was certainly most gor geous spectacle got up regardless of expense clear it was that god was being borne to the grave tootling of ﬂutes roaring of horns an immense brass band of all sorts such din that even claudius could hear it joy and rejoicing on every side the roman people walking about like free men agatho and few pettifoggers were weeping grief and once in way they meant it the barristers were crawling out of their dark corners pale and thin with hardly breath in their bodies though just coming to life again one of them when he saw the pettifoggers putting their heads together and lamenting their sad lot up comes he and says did not i tell you the saturnalia could not last ever when claudius saw his own funeral train he understood that he was dead they were chanting his dir ge in anapaests with much mopping and mouthing pour forth your laments your sorrow declare let the sounds of grief rise high in the air he that is dead had wit most keen was bravest of all that on earth have been racehorses are nothing to his swift feet rebellious parthians he did defeat swift after the persians his light shafts go he well knew how to ﬁt arrow to bow swiftly the striped barbarians ﬂed with one little wound he shot them dead and the britons beyond in their unknown seas brigantians too all these he chained by the neck the romans slaves he spake and the ocean with trembling waves accepted the axe of the roman law weep the man this world never saw one quicker troublesome suit to decide when only one part of the case had been tried he could it indeed and not hear either side who now sit in judgment the whole year round now he that is judge of the shades under ground once ruler of ﬁvescore cities in crete must yield to his better and take back seat mourn mourn pettifoggers ye venal crew and you minor poets woe woe is to you apocolocyntosis project gutenberg https you above all who get rich quick by the rattle of dice and the three card trick claudius was charmed to hear his own praises sung and would have stayed longer to see the show but the talthybius 16 of the gods laid hand on him and led him across the campus martius ﬁrst wrapping his head up close that one might know him until betwixt tiber and the subway he went down to the lower regions 17 his freedman narcissus had gone down before him by short cut ready to welcome his master out he comes to meet him smooth and shining he had just left the bath and says he what make the gods among mortals look alive says mercury go and tell them we are coming away he ﬂew quicker than tongue can tell it is easy going by that road all down hill so although he had touch of the gout in trice they were come to dis door there lay cerberus or horace puts it the monster claudius was triﬂe perturbed it was little white bitch he used to keep pet when he spied this black hound not at all the kind of thing you could wish to meet in the dark in loud voice he cried claudius is coming all marched before him singing the lost is found let us rejoice together 18 here were found silius consul elect juncus the sextus traulus helvius trogus cotta vettius valens fabius roman knights whom narcissus had ordered execution in the midst of this chanting company was mnester the mime whom claudius honour sake had made shorter by head the news was soon blown about that claudius had come to messalina they throng ﬁrst his freedmen polybius myron harpocras amphaeus pheronactus all sent before him by claudius that he might not be unattended anywhere next two prefects justus catonius and rufrius pollio then his friends saturninus lusius and pedo pompeius and lupus and celer asinius these of consular rank last came his brother daughter his sister daughter fathers and the whole family in fact in body they came to meet claudius and when claudius saw them he exclaimed friends everywhere on my word how came you all here to this pedo pompeius answered what cruel man how came we here who but you sent us you the murderer of all the friends that ever you had to court with you i show you where their lordships sit pedo brings him before the judgement seat of aeacus who was holding court under the lex cornelia to try cases of murder and assassination pedo requests the judge to take the prisoner name and produces summons with this char ge senators killed 35 roman knights 221 others the sands of the multitude claudius ﬁnds counsel at length out steps p petronius an old chum of his ﬁnished scholar in the claudian tongue and claims remand not granted pedo pompeius prosecutes with loud outcry the counsel the defence tries to reply but aeacus who is the soul of justice will not have it aeacus hears the case against claudius refuses to hear the other side and passes sentence against him quoting the line he did so be he done by this is justice undeﬁled 19 great silence fell not soul but was stupeﬁed at this new way of managing matters they had never known anything like it before it was new thing to claudius yet he thought it unfair there was long discussion to the punishment he ought to endure some said that sisyphus had done his job of porterage long enough tantalus would be dying of thirst if he were not relieved the drag must be put at last on wretched ixion wheel but it was determined not to let of f any of the old stagers lest claudius should dare to hope any such relief it was agreed that some new punishment must be devised they must devise some new task something senseless to suggest some craving without result then aeacus decreed he should rattle dice ever in box with bottom at once the poor wretch began his fruitless task of hunting the dice which ever slipped from his ﬁngers when he rattled with the box and thought he now had got the little cubes would vanish thro the perforated ii 13 3513 il 14 apocolocyntosis project gutenberg https he would pick up again and once more set the dice but served him the same trick away they went so still he tries and still he fails still searching long he lingers and every time the tricksy things go slipping thro his ﬁngers just so when sisyphus at last once gets there with his boulder he ﬁnds the labour all in vain it rolls down of f his shoulder all on sudden who should turn up but caligula and claims the man slave brings witnesses who said they had seen him being ﬂogged caned ﬁsticuf fed by him he is handed over to caligula and caligula makes him present to aeacus aeacus
