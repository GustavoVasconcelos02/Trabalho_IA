shower of sparks it swept from one point to another burning the dry brushwood already in the east there were skirmishes the prelude to the great war of the nations all europe europe that only yesterday was sceptical and apathetic like dead wood was swept by the flames all men were possessed by the desire battle war was ever on the point of breaking out it was stamped out but it sprang to life again the world felt that it was at the mercy of an accident that might let loose the dogs of war the world lay in wait the feeling of inevitability weighed heavily even upon the most pacifically minded and ideologues sheltered beneath the massive shadows of the cyclops proudhon hymned in war man fairest title of nobility this then was to be the end of the physical and moral resurr ection of

striking variant on la mêlée yet though the voice comes to us over the carnage its message is not marred by the passions of the moment after eighteen months of war we are learning to look about us more calmly and to distinguish amid the ruins those of europe intellectual leaders who have not been swept off their feet by the fury of the tempest almost alone romain rolland has stood the test the two main characteristics which strike us in all that he writes are lucidity and common qualities most needed by every one in thought upon the war but there is another feature of rolland work which contributes to its universal appeal he describes our feelings and sensations in the presence of given situation not what actually passes befor our eyes he describes the effects and causes of things but not the things themselves through his work the agence internationale des prisonniers guerr to which one of the articles now collected is largely devoted he is moreover in position to observe every phase of the great battle between ideals and between nations which fills him with such anguish and indignation and with his matchless insight and sympathy he gives permanent form to our vague feelings in these noble and inspiring essays it will not however surprise the vast public who have read to find that while so many have capitulated to the madness of the terrible year through which we have passed rolland has remained firm and has surpassed himself he was prepared the extract placed at the beginning of this volume shows he was one of the few who realized only too well the horror he was powerless to prevent yet he made every effort to open the eyes of europe and especially of the young so many of whom had learned to look up to him leader to these young men one of the finest essays in the present collection is primarily jeunesse hér oique du monde eighteen months have passed and they still endure the terrible ordeal the young men of germany and france whom he had striven so hard to bring together on whose aspirations and failings is critical commentary the movements and tendencies of society were there given dramatic embodiment permeated rolland by the life struggle between good and bad love and hatred which makes life worth living all is set down with the clear analysis of feeling natural to musical critic but in spite of his burning words on the destruction of rheims rolland is clear from his other critical and biographical writings is more interested in men than in their achievements and the men of today interest him most passionately young men he has said not bother about the old peop le make of our bodies and go forward and above all it is the permanent things in life with which he is concerned lowes dickinson puts it rolland is one of the many who believe though their voice the moment may be silenced that the spiritual forces that are important and ought to prevail are the international ones that not war is the right destiny of nations and that all that is valuable in each people may be maintained in and by friendly intercourse with the others the war between these two ideals is the greater war that lies behind the present conflict hundreds and thousands of generous youths have gone to battle in the belief that they are going to that will end war that they are fighting against militarism in the cause of peace whether indeed it is that they will have risked or lost their lives only the event can show the forces against such ideals are powerful but rolland is not dismayed come friends let us make stand can we not resist this contagion whatever its nature and virulence moral epidemic or cosmic force and he appeals not only in the name of humanity but in the name of that france which he loves so la vraie france of which jaurès wrote in the untranslatable words which rolland has quoted qui pas résumée dans une époque et dans un jour ni dans le jour y des siècles ni dans le jour la france tout entière dans la

rolland has written the significance of the present volume is not less apparent to english readers some of the articles and letters now collected have already appeared in english the most part in the pages of the cambridge magazine from which they have been widely quoted in the press help in rendering the translations adequately possible i may also take this opportunity of acknowledging my special indebtedness to roger fry 1 who has just issued through the omega workshops striking translation of some of the most recent french poetry inspired by the war to james wood who has himself done part of the translation particularly pro aris and to bennett of caius college whose version of above the battle has already been quoted by the archbishop of canterbury and others the most part the articles

ignorance which separate individuals and peoples like all the men of my time i have been brought up on these thoughts i have tried in my turn to share the bread of life with my younger or less fortunate brothers when the war came i did not think it my duty to deny these thoughts because the hour had come to put them to the test i have been insulted i knew that i should be and i went forward but i did not know that i should be insulted without even hearing several months one in france could know my writings except through scraps of phrases arbitrarily extracted and mutilated by my enemies it is shameful record nearly year this has gone on certain socialist or syndicalist papers may have succeeded here and there in getting some fragments through 2 but it was only in the month of june 1915 that the first time my chief article the one which was the object of the most violent criticism above the battle dating from september 1914 could be published in full almost in full thanks to the malevolent zeal of maladroit pamphleteer to whom i am indebted bringing my words before the french public the first time frenchman does not judge his adversary unheard whoever does so judges and

he belongs to the whole of all national hatreds and preserving the calm ness of his soul on those heights wher we feel the happiness and the misfortunes of other peoples our own i myself have labored all my life to bring together the minds of our two nations and the atrocities of this impious war in which to the ruin of european civilization they are involved will never lead to soil my spirit with hatred whatever pain then your germany may give whatever reasons i may have to stigmatize criminal german policy and the means it employs i not attach responsibility it to the people which is burdened with it and is used its blind instrument it is not that i regard you war fatality frenchman does not believe in fatality fatality is the excuse of souls without will war springs from the weakness and stupidity of nations one can not feel resentment against them it one can only pity them i not reproach you with our miseries yours will be less if france is ruined germany will be ruined too i did not even raise my voice when i saw your armies violating the neutrality of noble belgium this flagrant breach of honor which incurs the contempt of every upright conscience is quite in the political tradition of your prussian kings it did not surprise but when i see the fury with which you are treating that magnanimous nation whose only crime has been to defend its independence and the cause of justice to the last you germans yourselves did in 1813 that is too much the world is revolted by it keep these savageries us frenchmen your true enemies but to wreak them against your victims against this small unhappy innocent belgian people how shameful is this and not content to fling yourselves on living belgium you wage war on the dead on the glories of past ages you bombard malines you burn rubens and louvain is now more than heap of with its treasures of art and of science the sacred town what are you then hauptmann and by what name you want us to call you now since you repudiate the title of barbarians are you the grandsons of goethe or of attila are you making war on enemies or on the human spirit kill men if you like but respect masterpieces they are the patrimony of the human race you like all the rest of us are its depositories in pillaging it you you show yourselves unworthy of our great heritage unworthy to take your place in that little european army which is

hauptmann in the name of our europe of which you have hitherto been one of the most illustrious champions in the name of that civilization which the greatest of men have striven all down the ages in the name of the very honor of your germanic race gerhart hauptmann i abjure you i challenge you you and the intellectuals of germany amongst whom i reckon so many friends to protest with all your energy against this crime which is recoiling upon you if you fail to this you will prove one of two things either that you approve what has been in that case may the opinion of mankind crush else that you are powerless to raise protest against the huns who command you if this be so by what title can you still claim you have claimed that you fight the cause of liberty and human progress you are giving the world proof that incapable of defending the liberty of the world you are even incapable of defending your own and that the best of germany is helpless beneath vile despotism which mutilates masterpieces and murders the spirit of man i am expecting an answer from you hauptmann an answer that may be an act the opinion of europe awaits it i think about it at such time silence itself is an act journal genève wednesday 2 ii pro aris 5 among the many crimes of this infamous war which are all odious to us why have we chosen protest the crimes against things and not against men the destruction of works and not of lives many are surprised by this and have even reproached us if we have not much pity they the bodies and hearts of the thousands of victims who are crucified yet over the armies which fall there flies the vision of their love and of la patrie to which they sacrifice these lives which are passing away passes the holy ark of the art and thought of centuries borne on their shoulders the bearers can change may the ark be saved to the élite of the world falls the task of guarding it and since the common treasure is threatened may they rise to protect it i am glad to think that in the latin countries this sacred duty has always been regarded paramount our france which bleeds with so many other wounds has suffered nothing more cruel than the attack against her parthenon the cathedral of rheims our lady of france letters which i have received from sorely tried families and from soldiers who two months have borne every hardship show and i am proud of it them and my people that there was burde n heavier them to bear it is because we put spirit above flesh very different is the case of the german intellectuals who to my reproaches the sacrilegious acts of their devastating armies have all replied with one voice perish every rather than one german soldier piece of architecture like rheims is much more than one life it is centuries vibrate like symphony in this organ of stone it is their memories of joy of glory and of grief their meditations ironies dreams it is the tree of the race whose roots plunge to the profoundest depths of its soil and whose branches stretch with sublime élan towards the sky it is still more its beauty which soars above the struggles of nations is the harmonious response made by the human race to the riddle of the world

responsible the crimes of few the drama which unfolds itself before our eyes and whose almost certain dénouement will be the crushing of the german hegemony is enough us what brings it home to us most nearly is that not one of those who constitute the moral and intellectual élite of hundred noble spirits and those thousands of brave hearts of which great nation was ever one really suspects the crimes of his government the atrocitie s committed in flanders in the north and in the east of france during the two or three first weeks of the war or one can safely wager the voluntary devastations of the towns of belgium and the ruin of rheims if they came to look at the reality i know that many of them would weep with grief and shame and of all the shortcomings of prussian imperialism the worst and the vilest is to have concealed its crimes from its people by depriving them of the means of protesting against those crimes it has involved them ever in the responsibility it has abused their magnificent devotion the intellectuals however are also guilty if one admits that the brave men who in every count ry tamely feed upon the news which their papers and their leaders give them nourishment allow themselves to be duped one can not pardon those whose duty it is to seek truth in the midst of error and to know the value of interested witnesses and passionate hallucinations before bursting into the midst of this furious debate upon which was staked the destruction of nations and of the treasures of the spirit their first duty duty of loyalty much of common sense should have been to consider the problems from both sides by blind loyalty and culpable trustfulness they have rushed head foremost into the net which their imperialism had spread they believed that their first duty was with their eyes closed to defend the honor of their state against all accusation they did not see that the noblest means of defending it was to disavow its faults and to cleanse their country of them i have awaited this virile disavowal from the proudest spirits of germany disavowal which would have been ennobling instea d of humiliating the letter which i wrote to one of them the day after the brutal voice of wolff agency pompously proclaimed that there remained of louvain more than heap of ashes was received by the entire élite of germany in spirit of enmity they did not understand that i offered them the chance of releasing germany from the fetters of those crimes which its empire was forging in its name what did i ask of them what did i ask of you all finer spirits of germany express at least courageous regret the excesses committed and to dare to remind unbridled power that even the fatherland can not save itself through crime and that above its rights are those of the human spirit i only asked one single free voice none spoke i heard only the clamor of herds the pack of intellectuals giving tongue on the track whereon the hunter loosed them and that insolent manifesto in which without the slightest effort to justify its crimes you have unanimously declared that they not exist and your theologians your pastors your have stated further that you are very just and that you thank god having made you thus race of pharisees what chastisement from on high shall scour ge your sacrilegious pride you not suspect the evil which you have done to your own people the megalomania menace to the world of an ostwald or an chamberlain 6 the criminal determination of intellectuals not to wish to see the truth will have cost germany more than ten defeats how clumsy you are i believe that of all your faults maladr is the worst you have not said one word since the beginning of this war which has not been more fatal you than all the speeches of your adversaries it is you who have furnished the proof or the argument of the worst accusations that have been brought against you just your official agencies under the stupid illusion of terrorizing us have been the first to launch emphatic recitals of your most sinister devastations it is you who when the most impartial of your adversaries were obliged in fairness to limit the responsibility of these acts to few of your leaders and armies have angrily claimed your share it is you who the day after the destruction of rheims which in your inmost hearts should have dismayed the best amongst you have boasted of it in imbecile pride instead of trying to 26 27 28 29 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https yourselves 7 it is you wretched creatures you representatives of the spirit who have not ceased to extol force and to despise the weak if you did not know that the wheel of fortune turns that this force one day will weigh afresh upon you in past ages when your great men at least retained the consolation of not having yielded to it the sovereignty of the spirit and the sacred rights of right what reproaches what remorse are you heaping up the future blind who are leading into the ditch your nation which follows you like the stumbling blind men of brueghel what poor ar guments you have opposed to us two months war is war say you that is to say without common measure with the rest of things above morals and reason and all the limits of ordinary life kind of supernat ural state before which one can only bow without discussion germany is germany that is to say without common measure with the rest of nations the laws which apply to others not apply to her and the rights which she arrogates to herself to violate right appertain to her alone thus she can without crime tear up written promises betray sworn oaths violate the neutrality of peoples which she has pledged herself to defend but she claims in return the right to find in the nations which she outrages chivalrous adversaries and that they should not be so that they should dare to defend themselves by all the means and the arms that remain to them she proclaims crime one recognizes there indeed the intere sted teaching of your prussian masters great minds of germany i not doubt your sincerity but you are longer capable of seeing the truth prussian imperialism has crushed down over your eyes and consc ience its spiked helmet necessity knows law here is the eleventh commandment the message that you bring to the universe today sons of kant we have heard it more than once in history it is the famous doctrine of public safety mother of heroisms and crimes every nation has recourse to it in the hour of danger but the greatest are those who defend against it their immortal soul fifteen years have passed since the famous trial which saw single innocent man opposed to the force of the state fifteen years have passed since we french affronted and shattered the idol of public safety when it threatened our péguy says the eternal safety of france listen to him whom you have killed listen to hero of the french conscience writers who have the keeping of the

death to be or not to be you say that is not enough to be the great germany to be the great france worthy of their past and respecting one another even while fighting that is what i wish i should blush victory if my france bought it at the price which you will pay your temporary success even while the battles are being fought upon the plains of belgium and amongst the chalky slopes of champagne another war is taking place upon the field of the spirit and often victory below means defeat above the conquest of belgium malines louvain and rheims the carillons of flanders will sound

remembers and waits he knows that even if she has never proved strong enough to bear victory without wavering it is in her hours of trouble that she reforms herself and her greatest geniuses are sons of sorrow september 1914 since these lines were written i have watched the birth of the anxiety which little by little is making its way into the consciences of the good people of germany first secret doubt kept under by stubborn effort to believe the bad arguments collected by their government to oppose fabricated to prove that belgium had renounced her neutrality herself false allegations in vain repudiated four times by the french government by the commander by the cardinal and the archbishop and by the mayor of rheims the french of using the cathedral of rheims military purposes lacking arguments their system of defense is at times disconcerting in its naïveté is it possible they say that we should be accused of wishing to destroy artistic monuments we the people above all others who venerate art in whom is instilled this respect from infancy who have the greatest number of text books and historical collections of art and the longest list of lectures on æsthetics is it possible to accuse of the most barbarous actions the most humane the most affectionate and the most homely of peoples the idea never strikes them that germany is not constituted by single race of men and that besides the obedient masses who are born to obey to respect the the is the race which commands which believes itself above all laws and which makes and unmakes them in the name of force and necessity not it is this evil marriage of idealism and german force which leads to these disasters the idealism proves to be woman woman captive who like so many worthy german wives worships her lord and master and refuses even to think that he could ever be wrong it is however necessary the salvation of germany that she should one day countenance the thought of divorce or that the wife should have the courage to make her voice heard in the household i already know several who are beginning to champion the rights of the spirit against force many german voice has reached us lately in letters protesting against war and deploring with us the injustices which we deplore i will not give their names in order not to compromise them not very long ago i told the fair 8 which obstructed paris that it was not france i say today to the german fair you are not the true germany there exists another germany juster and more human whose ambition is not to dominate the world by force and guile but to

understanding though it will not suppress the conflict may perhaps suppress our hatred and it is hatred more than anything else that i regard my enemy however much i may feel that the motives

country that the ardor of patriotic faith is everywhere the same and that each of the nations engaged in this mighty struggle believes itself to be the champion of liberty against barbarism but liberty and barbarism not mean the same thing to both sides barbarous despotism the worst enemy to liberty is exemplified us frenchmen englishmen men of the west in prussian imperialism and i venture to think that the register of its methods is plainly set forth in the devastated route from liège to senlis passing by way of louvain malines and rheims germany the monster ungeheuer the aged wundt

better by this means we shall be able to weigh the german dange r and the russian danger in the balance and thus show which of the two seems the more threatening to us of the actual events of the present war between germany and russia i will say nothing all the information we have comes from russian or german sources equally unreliable to judge by them it would appear that the same ferocity exists in both camps the germans in kalish were worthy companions of the cossacks in grodtken and is of the german spirit and of the russian spirit that i wish to speak here this is the important

all relations how much i love the germany of the past and all that i owe to it not less than you yourselves i am the son of beethoven of leibnitz and of goethe but what i owe to the germany of today

which i owe to that nation well to themselves even if the contempt prussian imperialism were not innate in latin i should have learned it from them twenty years ago tolstoi expre ssed his contempt

my german friends you are either strangely ignorant of the state of mind of the nations which surround you or you think us extreme ly simple and your imperialism beneath its veneer of civilization seems to less ferocious than czarism towards everything that ventures to oppose its avaricious desire universal dominion but wher eas immense and mysterious russia overflowing with young and

awful fate this spirit were triumphant i should leave europe ever to live here would be intolerable to here then are some extracts from the interesting letter which i have received from representative of those little nationalities which are being disputed between russia and germany they desire to maintain their independence but find themselves obliged to choose between these two nations and choose

to thank you your article above the although by my education i am more akin to the civilizations of germany and russia than to the civilization of france yet i respect the french spirit more i am convinced more than ever today that it will furnish the greatly needed solution of the problems of national rights and liberty in your article you quote the words of one of your friends soldier and writer who says that the french are fighting not only to defend their own country but to save the liberty of the world you can hardly imagine how such words in the hearts of oppressed nations what streams of sympathy are today conver ging from all corners of europe upon france what hopes depend upon your victory and yet many doubts have been expressed with regard to these french and english assertions because both nations have allied themselves with russia whose policy is contrary to the ideas of right and liberty and germany herself maintains that it is precisely those ideas which she is fighting against russia it would be interesting to discover what german writers and professors really mean when they speak of holy war against russia they wish to assist russian revolutionaries to dethrone the czar revolutionary party would refuse indignantly to accept assistance from prussian militarism they wish to set free the neighboring countries such poland which are oppressed by russia by incorporating them with the german empire is well known that the poles who are german subjects have suffered much more ignoble treatment than the russian poles though even they have every reason to complain the baltic provinces of russia alone remain and here the germans have centuries had their pioneers among the large landowners and the merchants in the bigger towns these doubt russian subjects but of german nationality would welcome the german armies with enthusiasm but they form only caste of nobles and of the wealthy classes numbering at most few thousands whereas the bulk of the population the lettish and esthonian nations would regard the absorption of these provinces into germany the worst of calamities we know well what german domination means i am lett and can speak with authority i know the deepest feelings and hopes of my own countrymen 63 64 65 66 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https letts are akin to the lithuanians they inhabit courland livonia and part of the province of vitebsk their intellectual center is riga there are colonies of them in all the principal towns of russia last year the annales des nationalités of paris devoted two numbers to these two sister nations owing to the geographical situation of their country which is only too desirable they had the misfortune to be under the yoke of the germans before they were under the yoke of the russians to understand how much they suffered under the former it will be sufficient to say that in comparison with the germans we think of the russians our liberators by sheer force the germans kept us centuries in state equivalent to slavery only fifty years ago the russian government set us free from this bondage but at the same time it committed the grave injustice of leaving all our land in the hands of german proprietors nevertheless within the last twenty or thirty years we have succeeded in reclaiming from the germans part at least of our land and in reaching considerable level of culture thanks to which we are considered together with the esthonians and the finns the most advanced people in the russian empire german papers often accuse us of ingratitude and reproach us with our lack of appreciation of the advantages of the culture which they boast of having brought us we listen to such accusations with bitter smile and in writing the word kulturträger bearer of civilization add an exclamation mark afterwards the behavior of the germans has brought the expression into contempt we have acquired our cultur in spite of their opposition and against their will even today it is the german representatives in the russian duma who veto the occasional suggestions on the part of the government to make reforms in the baltic provinces these provinces are administered in manner that differs and differs the worse from that adopted in the other provinces of russia we still submit to laws and regulations which longer exist in other parts of which were made in the feudal ages and have been rigorously maintained amongst us thanks to the exertions of the big german landowners who are always sure of hearing at the imperial court of petersbur formerly when we were striving in vain to reconcile our sympathy and admiration german thought and art with the narrow haughty and cruel spirit of its representatives amongst us we explained it all by saying that the germans in our provinces were of peculiar type and had little in common with other germans but the crimes of which they have been guilty in belgium and in france show us our mistake german s are the same everywhere in the work of conquest and without humanitarian scruples in germany in russia there are two distinct one provoked by the ideas of pangermanism and panslavism is to seek national glory on the field of battle and in the oppression of the personalities of other nations the other is to achieve the same end in the peaceful realms of thought and artistic creation just the culture of which goethe was typical has nothing in common with prussian militarism so tolstoi may be considered the representative of that other russia which is so different from the one represented by the russian government of today certainly the gulf between these two tendencies is less deep in germany than in russia and this is due to the immense size of russia which contains vast numbers of poor and ignorant human beings whom the russian government oppresses with the utmost brutality but it is entirely unjust always to allude to the russians barbarians and the germans who invariably make use of this word when they speak of russia have less right than any one to so one who knows the intellectual world of germany and russia will venture to say that the former is much superior to the latter are simply different and i would add that the one fact which makes us feel more drawn to the intellectual world of russia than to that of the germany of today is that it would never be capable of justifying and approving the brutal conduct of its government the german intellectuals are doing now it has often been constrained to keep silence but it has never raised its voice in defense of guilty government let not my testimony in favor of the russians lead any one to believe that i am idealizing them or that my people the letts have enjoyed any special privileges under their government on the contrary i have suffered more at their hands than at the hands of the germans and my nation knows only too well how heavy is the hand of the russian 67 68 69 70 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https and how suffocating the atmosphere of panslavism in 1906 it was the lett peasant and intellectual classes who enjoyed most frequently the privilege of being flogged it was amongst these classes that the greatest number of unfortunates were shot hanged or imprisoned life and since that dreadful year there are to be found in all the principal towns of western europ colonies of letts formed of refugees who succeeded in escaping from the atrocities of the punitive expedition sent by the russian government against my country but this fact is significant at the head of the majority of the military bands commissioned to punish the country were german officers who had asked this employment and showed so great zeal in shooting down men and setting fire to houses that they went even beyond the intentions of the russian government in those days the places might count themselves fortunate which were visited by dragoons commanded by officers of russian nationality wher russian officers would have ordered the knout german officers habitually inflicted sentence of death if my nation had ever to choose between german and russian government it would choose the latter the lesser of two evils i see in the lett newspapers that the reservists of my country left the war with enthusiasm i not imagine that this enthusiasm is due to the thought that they are fighting the glory of nation which by every means in its power seeks to hinder our national development by forbidding instructi on in our native tongue in primary schools by attempting to colonize our land with russian peasants by compelling our own people to emigrate to siberia and america by excluding all letts from any share in government employment etc this enthusiasm nevertheless exists and it is because the war is being waged against germany and because the letts know that the germans have long been aiming at the possess ion of the baltic provinces to prevent this we are prepared to make any sacrifice we who love our national civilization and know well what panslavism and pangermanism mean are of opinion that of the two panslavism is less fatal to the civilizations of small nations this is really due to the character of the two races german oppression is always systematic hence always efficacious in addition to this their arrogant contempt everything that is not themselves the calm and calculated method in which they carry out their system of persecution wher ever they dominate all this makes them intolerable russians are less logical by natur their minds are not so regulated and they are more inclined to obey the dictates of their hearts this reason they are less to be feared oppressors the blows which they strike are often extremely cruel and painful but they can repent from time to time their manners are rougher and more brutal i speak here more especially of civil and military officials but on the whole they are more humane than the germans who often conceal feelings of fierce savagery under the mask of perfect courtesy in the year 1906 when there were executions in russia on large scale there were many cases of suicide amongst russian officers who could not reconcile their profession of soldiers with that of hangman the officers of german nationality on the other hand carried out their or ders with enjoyment nevertheless russian domination though preferable to german is still very oppressive i hear the news of russian victories with mingled feelings rejoicing in so far they are victories the allies yet dreading the triumph of russia after the defeats of the war when the russian government was weakened it conceded certain liberal measures and then revoked them almost entirely its strength returned what have we to expect from victory czarism especially we who are not russians but savage revival of the crushing ideals of panslavism this is the agonized question which the nations subject to russia are asking now i read in your article that the turn of czarism will come after that of prussianism in what sense is this to be understood is it your opinion that another war will presently break out against czarism or will it be struck down by the blows of an internal revolution is it even possible that france and england obtained the promise of reform in the internal politics of russia before allying thems elves with her and is the proclamation to the 71 72 73 74 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https evidence of this will it have any real effect after the war and those other nations oppressed by finns the letts the lithuanians the esthonians the armenians the jews they too have justice done them these questions are probably devoid of any political significance yet without perceiving in what manner france and england can set us free we direct our hopes towards them we believe that in some way or other they will take care in future that their russian ally shall show herself worthy of them and of the ideas which they are fighting lest the blood of those who have died in the cause of freedom go to feed the strength of the oppressors thus sir i have ventured uninvited to set forth rather fully to you the hopes and fears of nation which has developed itself on narrow strip of land between the two abysses of pangermanism and panslavism whilst ardently desiring the destruction of the former we have everything to fear from the latter yet we not aspire to political independence we seek only the possibility of developing freely our intellectual artistic and economic powers without the perpetual menace of being absorbed by russia or germany we believe that in virtue of the civilization we have acquired in the face of obstacles we are worthy of the liberties and rights of man we are convinced that nation we have qualities which will fit us to play valuable part in the great symphony of civilized peoples journal genève october

minds work ceaselessly in german science the conquest of the truth but i see on the one hand these good people so so tractable with their eyes shut ignorant of the facts and unwilling to recognize anything but what it is the pleasure of their government that they shall know and on the other the clearest minds of germany historians and savants trained the criticism of texts basing their conv iction on documents which all emanate from one alone of the parties concerned and by way of peremptory proof referring us to the affirmations of their emperor and of their chancellor like scholars

kind and of every color whose testimony demands the attention of an impartial judge but they so much know of their existence and does the master allow his class to handle the manuals of his enemies

today blush es at her former sentimentality i carefully refrain from appealing to her pity by whinings they call them about the destruction of louvain and rheims war is war granted it is natural that it drags in its train thousands of prisoners of ficers and men the moment i shall say only word about these in order to comfort far possible the families who are searching them and are so anxious about their fate on both sides hateful rumors circulate only too easily rumors given currenc y by an unscrupulous press rumors which would have us believe that the most elemen tary laws of humanity are trampled under foot by the enemy only the other day an austr ian friend wrote to maddened by the lies of some paper or other to beg to help the german wounded in france who are left without any aid and have i not heard or read the same unworthy fears expressed by frenchmen regards their wounded who are said to be maltreated in germany but it is all both sides and those of us whose task it is to receive the true information from either camp must affirm the contrary speaking generally in so many thousands of cases one can not of course be sure that there will not here and there be individual exceptions this war whose actual conduct has provoked degree of harshness which our knowledge of previous wars in the west would not have allowed us to expect is by contrast less cruel to all and are put out of the battle line the letters that we receive and documents already an interesting account which appeared in the neue zürcher zeitung of october 18th written by schneeli who had just been visiting the hospitals and prisoners camps in show that in that country efforts are being made to reconcile the ideals of humanity with the exigencies of war they make it clear that there is difference between the care bestowed by the germans on their own wounded and those of the enemy and that friendly relations exist between the prisoners and their guards who all share the same food i could wish that similar inquiry might be made and published on the camp s where german prisoners are concentrated in france in the meantime accounts which reach from individuals disclose similar situation 18 and there is plenty of reliable evidence that in germany and france alike the wounded of both countries are living in terms of friendship there are even soldiers who refuse to have their wounds dressed or receive their rations before their comrades the enemy have received similar attention and who 79 80 81 82 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https if it is not perhaps in the ranks of the contending armies that the feelings of national hatred are least violent there one learns to appreciate the courage of one adversaries since the same sufferings are common to all and since where all energy is directed towards action there is none left personal animosity it is amongst those who are not actively engaged that there is developed the harsh and implacable brand of hatred of which certain intellectuals provide terrible examples the moral situation of the military prisoner is therefore not so overwhelming might be imagined and his lot sad it is is less to be pitied than that of another class of prisoners of whom i shall speak later the feeling of duty accomplished the memory of the struggle glorifies his misfortune in his own eyes and even in those of the enemy he is not totally abandoned to the foe international conventions protect him the red cross watches over him and it is possible to discover where he is and to come to his assistance in this work the admirable agence internationale des prisonniers guerr most providentially established some two months after the commencement of the war has caused the name of geneva to be known and blessed in the most remote corners of france and germany it only needs like providence itself to gain the of those over whose interests it watches that is to say of the states concerned which have been somewhat slow in supplying the lists we need under the ægis of the international committee of the red cross with gustave ador president and max dollfus director some 300 voluntary workers drawn from all classes of society are assisting in its charitable work more than letters day pass through its hands it daily transmits about letters between prisoners and their families and is respo nsible the safe dispatch of some francs on an average the precise information which it is able to communicate was very meager at the start but soon increased until thousand cases could be dealt with in the course of single day and this number rapidly increased with the arrival of more complete lists from the governments concerned this renewal of intercourse between prisoner and his family is not the only beneficial result of our organization its peaceful work its impartial knowledge of the actual facts in the belligerent countries contribute to modify the hatred which wild stories have exasperated and to reveal what remains of humanity in the most envenomed enemy it can also draw the attention of the different governments or at least of the gener al public to cases where speedy understanding would be in the interest of both instance in the exchange of men who are so seriously wounded that they will be quite unable to take further part in the war and whom it is useless and inhuman to keep languishing far from their friends finally it can effectively direct public generosity which often hesitates want of guidance it can instance point out to neutral countries who are so ungrudging in their anxiety to aid the sufferings of the combatants where help is most urgently or the wounded prisoners convalescents leaving the hospital without linen or boots and with claims on the enemy furthe r support 19 instead of showering gifts which doubt are never superfluous on the armies who can and should be supported by the peoples whom they are fighting neutrals might well reserve the greater part of their generosity those who are most destitute those whose need is the greatest they are feeble broken and alone but there is another class of prisoners on whom i would like interest to be specially concentrated their situation is far more precarious unprotected they are by any international convention these are the civil prisoners they are one of the innovations of this unbridled war which seems to have set itself to violate all the rights of humanity in former wars it was only question of few hostages arrested here and there guarantee of good faith the pledge of some conquered town never until now had one heard of populations taken bodily into captivity on the model of ancient custom actively revived since the begin ning of this war such contingency not having been foreseen conventions existed to regulate the situation in the laws of war if the 83 84 85 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https have any meaning and it would have been awkward to formulate fresh laws in the midst of the struggle it seemed more simple to overlook them it has been though these unfortunates did not exist but they exist and in thousands their number seems about equal on both sides which of the belligerents took the initiative in these captures at present certainty is impossible it seems clear that in the second half of july germany ordered the arrest of number of alsatian civilians to this france replied the day after her mobilization by declaring prisoners germans and austrians then to be found on her territory the casting of this vast net was followed by similar action in germany and austria though perhaps with less result the conquest of belgium and the invasion of the north of france brought about redoubling of these measures aggravated by violence the germans on retiring after their defeat on the marne methodically made clean sweep in the towns and villages of picardy and flanders of all persons capable of bearing men at douai at amiens summoned before the citadel on some apparently harmless pretext and carried of f without even the possibility of returning change of clothes in many cases the captures had not even the excuse of military utility in the village of sompuis marne on september 10th the saxons seized helpless village priest of scarcely able to walk and five old men of ages from sixty to seventy one of whom was lame and took them away on foot elsewhere women and children are taken happy if they can remain together here husband mad with grief searches his wife and son aged three who have disappeared since the germans passed through quièvrechain nord there it is mother and her children taken by the french near guebwiller the children were sent back but not the mother french captain wounded by the bursting of shell saw his wife also wounded by german bullets at nomêny since when she has disappeared taken he does not know where an old peasant woman of is taken away from her husband near vents meuse by company of germans child of sixteen is seized at its mother house at mulhouse such action shows an utter lack of human feeling and is almost more absurd than cruel it really appears though people had been deliberately separated from all who were dearest to them and of those who have so disappeared trace remains by which they can at present be found i am not speaking of belgium there the silence is of the grave of what is taking place there nothing has been heard in the outer world three months are the villages and towns still in existence i have before letters from parents in some cases belonging to neutral nations begging news of their children of twelve or eight years of age detained in belgium since hostilities broke out i have even found in the lists of these vanished prisoners of citizens of four or two years of age are we to understand that they too could have been mobilized we see the anguish of the survivors imagine the distress of those who have disappeared deprived of money or the means of obtaining any from their families what misery is revealed in the first letters received from such families interned in france or germany mother whose little boy is ill although rich can not procure any money another with two children requests us to warn her family that if after the war nothing more is heard of her it will mean that she has died of hunger these cries of misery seemed in the noise of battle to fall on deaf ears the first two months the red cross itself absorbed in its immense task reserved all its help the military prisoners and the governments seemed to show superb disdain their unfortunate citizens of what use are such can not serve yet these are the most innocent victims of this war they have not taken part in it and nothing had prepared them such calamities fortunately man of generous sympathies he will not forgive publishing his name ferrière was touched by the misfortunes of these outcasts of the war with tenacity patient it was passionate he set himself to construct in the swarming hive of red cross workers special department to deal with their distress refusing to be 86 87 88 89 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https by the innumerable difficulties and the remote chances of success he persevered limiting himself at first to drawing up lists of the missing and trying to inspire confidence in their anxious friends he then attempted by every means in his power to discover the place of internment and to communications between relations and friends what joy when one can announce to family that the son or the father has been found every one of us at our i too had the honor of sharing in the though he were member of that family and luck would have it the first letter of this kind which i had to write was to comfort some good people in my own little town in the nivernais great progress has already been made the most pressing needs have obtained hearing the governments have agreed to liberate women children under seven teen and men over sixty repatriation began on october 23rd through the bureau of berne created by the federal council it remains if not to deliver the others we can not count on this before the end of the war at any rate to put them in communication with their families in such cases in many others more can be expected from the charitable efforts of private individuals than from governments the friends with whom we communicated in germany or austria in france have replied with enthusiasm all showing generous desire to take part in our work it is such questions transcending national pride which reveal the underlying fellowship of the nations which are tearing each other to pieces and the sacrilegious folly of war how friends and enemies are drawn together in the face of common suf fering which the ef forts of all humanity would hardly suf fice to alleviate when after three months of fratricidal struggle one has felt the calming influence of this wide human sympathy and turns once more to the field of strife the rasping cries of hate in the press inspire only horror and pity what object have they in view they wish to punish crimes and are crime in themse lves murderous words are the seeds of future murder in the diseased organism of fevered europe everything vibrates and reverberates without end every word every action arouses reprisals him who fans hatred hatred flares up to consume heroes of officialdom bullies of the press the blows which you deal very often reach your own people little though you think soldiers your prisoners delivered into the hands of the enemy they answer the harm which you have done and you escape the danger we can not stop the war but we can make it less bitter there are medicines the body we need medicines the soul to dress the wounds of hatred and vengeance by which the world is being poisoned we who that be our task and the red cross pursues its work of mercy in the midst of the combat like the bees of holy writ that made their honey in the jaws of the lion let us try to support its efforts let our thoughts follow the ambulances that gather up the wounded on the field of battle may la misèr lay on the brow of raging europe her stern but succoring hand may she open the eyes of these peoples blinded by pride and show them that they are but poor human flocks

these figures already invested and history has not yet completed their story the heroism of this people who without murmur sacrificed everything honor has burst like thunderclap upon us at time when the spirit of victorious germany was enthroning in the world conception of political realism resting stolidly on force and it was liberation of the oppressed idealism of the west and that the signal should have been given by this little nation seemed miracle men call the sudden appearance of hidden reality miracle it is the shock of danger which makes us best understand the character of individuals and of nations what discoveries this war has caused us to make in those around us even among those nearest and dearest to us what heroic hearts and savage beasts the inner soul not new soul reveals itself in this fearful hour belgium has seen the hidden genius of her race emer ge the sterling qualities that she has displayed during the last three months evoke admiration it should not surprise any one who in the pages of history has felt coursing through the ages the vigorous sap of her people small in numbers and in territory but one of the greatest in europe in virtue of her

song but one knows where he sang his last vii letter to m y critics 21 november 17 there has reached after much delay at geneva where i am engaged on the international work of prisoners of war the echo of attacks against in certain newspapers roused by the articles that i have published in the journal genève or 94 95 96 97 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https by two or three passages arbitrarily chosen from those articles they themselves are scarcely known to anybody in france my best reply will be to collect what i have written and publish it in paris i would not add word of explanation there is not line that i did not think it my right and my duty to set down moreover i think that there is better work to at this moment than to defend oneself there are others to defend the thousands of victims who are fighting in france time devoted to polemics is like theft from these unfortunates from these prisoners and families whose hands seeking each other across space we are trying to unite at geneva but not content with attacking personally they have attacked ideas and cause which i believe to be that of the true france and since my friends expect to defend these thoughts which are also theirs i profit by the hospitality which is offered to reply distinctly and frankly in good french i have published four articles letter to gerhart hauptmann written the day after the devastation of louvain above the battle the lesser of two evils and inter arma caritas in these four articles i have stated that of all the imperialisms which are the scour ge of the world prussian military imperialism is the worst i have declared that it is the enemy of european liberty the enemy of western civilization the enemy of germany herself and that it must be destroyed on this point i imagine we are agreed to what my critics take exception without entering into the discussion of certain points of detail such the appeal made by the allies to the forces of asia and africa of which i disapprove and still disapprove because i see in it near and grave danger europe and the allies themselves and because this danger is already materializing in threats of disturbance in the world of is taken essentially on two grounds my refusal to include the german people and its military and intellectual rulers in the same denunciation the esteem and friendship which i have the individuals in the country with which we are at war i will reply first of all without ambiguity to this second reproach yes i have german friends i have french italian and english friends and friends of every race they are my wealth i am proud of it and keep it when one has had the good fortune to meet in this world loyal souls with whom one shares one most intimate thoughts and with whom one has formed bonds of brotherly union such bonds are sacred and not to be broken asunder in the hour of trial he would be coward who timidly ceased to own them in order to obey the insolent summons of public opinion which has right over the heart does the love of country demand this unkindness of thought which is associated with the name cornélienne cornéille himself has given the answer vous nommé je ne vous connais plus vous connais encor et ce qui tue certain letters which i shall reproduce later will show the grief sometimes almost tragic that such friendships mean in these moments thanks to them we have at least been able to defend ourselves against hatred which is more murderous than war since it is an infection produced by its wounds and it does much harm to those whom it possesses to those against whom it is directed this poison i see with apprehension spreading at the present moment amon gst the victim populations the cruelties and ravages committed by the german armies have brought to birth desire reprisals this when once in existence is not the press to exasperate such desire runs the risk of leading to dangerous not only the conquered but above all the conquerors france has in this war the chance of playing the nobler part the rarest chance that the world has even seen german wrote to few weeks ago france has won in this war prodigious moral triumph the sympathies of the whole world are drawn towards her and most 98 99 100 101 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https of all germany herself has secret leaning towards her enemy all should wish that this moral triumph may be hers to the end and that she may remain to the end just straightforward and humane i could never distinguish the cause of france from that of humanity it is just because i am french that i leave to our prussian enemies the motto oderint dum i wish france to be loved i wish her to be victorious not only by force not only by right that would be difficult enough but by that large and generous heart which is hers i wish her to be strong enough to fight without hatred and to regard even those against whom she is forced to fight misguided brothers who must be pitied when they have been rendered harmless our soldiers know it well and i say nothing here of letters from the front which tell us of compassion and kindness between the combatants but the civilians who are outside the combat who not fight but talk who write and embroil themselves in factitious and lunatic agitation and are never exhausted these are delivered over to the winds of feverish violence and there is the danger they form opinion the only opinion that can be expressed all others are forbidden it is these that i write not those who are fighting they have need of us and when i hear the publicists trying to rouse the energies of the nation by all the stimulants at their disposal this one object the total crushing of the enemy nation i think it my duty to rise in opposition to what i believe to be at once moral and political error you make war against state not against people it would be monstrous to hold million men responsible the acts of some some hundreds here in french switzerland so passionately in sympathy with france so eager both in its sympathies and in the duty of restraining them i have been able three months by reading german letters and pamphlets to examine closely the conscience of the german nation and i have been able thus to take account of good many facts which escape the greater part of the french people the first the most striking the most ignored is that there is not in germany whole any real hatred of franc all the hatred is turned against england the especial pathos of the situation lies in the fact that the french spirit only really began to exercise an attraction upon germany some two or three years ago germany was beginning to discover the true france the france of work and of faith the new generations the young classes that they have just led to the abattoir of ypres and dixmude numbered the purest souls the greatest idealists those most possessed by the dream of universal brotherhood if i say that many among them the war has been laceration horror failure renunciation of every ideal an abdication of the spirit one of them wrote on the eve of his i say that the death of péguy has been mourned by many young germans one would believe but belief will be necessity the day i publish the documents which i have collected it is somewhat better understood in france how this german nation enveloped in the network of lies woven by its government and abandoning herself thereto with blind and obstinate loyalty is profoundly convinced that she was attacked hemmed in by the jealousy of the world and that she must defend herself at all costs or die it is among the chivalrous traditions of france to render homage to the courage of an adversary one owes it to that adversary to recognize that in default of other virtues the spirit of sacrifice is in the present instance almost boundless it would be great mistake to force it to extremes instead of driving this blind people to magnificent and desperate defense let us try to open their eyes it is not impos sible an alsatian patriot to whom one could not impute indulgence germany bucher of strasbour g told not long since that even though the german is full of haughty prejudices carefully fostered by his teachers he is at any rate always amenable to discussion and his docile spirit is accessible to arguments an example i would instance the secret evolution that i see in progress in the thought of certain germans numbe rs of german letters that i have read this month begin to utter agonized questionings to the legitimacy of the proceedings of germany in belgium i have seen this anxiety growing little by little in consciences which at first reposed in the conviction of their right truth is slowly dawning what will happen if its light conquers and spreads carry truth in your hands let it be our strongest weapon let us like the soldiers of the revolution whose hearts live again in our troops fight not 102 103 104 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https our enemies but them in saving the world let us save them too france does not break old chains in order to rivet new your thoughts are fixed on victory i think of the peace which will follow however insistently the most militarist among you may talk venturing did an article to hold out the delightful promise of perpetual war which will last after this war indefinitely 22 it will come to an end lack of combatants there must come day when you will stretch out the hand of friendship you and your neighbors across the rhine if it were only to come to an agreement the sake of your own business you will have to supportable and humane relations so set to work in such manner not to make them impossible not break down all the bridges since it will ever be necessary to cross the river not destroy the future good open clean wound will heal but not poison it let us be on our guard against hatred if we prepare war in peace according to the wisdom of nations we should also prepare peace in war it is task which seems to not unworthy of those among us who find themselves outside the strugg le and who through the life of the spirit have wider relations with the little lay church which today more than the other preserves its faith in the unity of human thought and believes that all men are sons of the same father in any case if such faith merits insult the insults constitute an honor that we will claim ours before the tribunal of posterity viii the idols more than forty centuries it has been the effort of great minds who have attained liberty to extend this blessing to others to liberate humanity and to teach men to see reality without fear or error to look themselves in the face without false pride or false humility and to recognize their weakne ss and their strength that they may know their true position in the universe they have illumined the path with the brightness of their lives and their example like the star of the magi that mankind may have light their efforts have failed more than forty centuries humanity has remained in not say to masters such are of the order of the flesh of which i am not speaking here and their chains break sooner or later but to the phantoms of their own minds such servitude comes from within we grow faint in the endeavor to cut the bonds which bind mankind who straightway tie them again to be more firmly enthralled of every liberator men make master every ideal which ought to liberate is transformed into clumsy idol the history of humanity is the history of idols and of their successive reigns and humanity grows older the power of the idol seems to wax greater and more destructive at first the divinities were of wood of stone or of metal those at any rate were not proof against the axe or against fire others followed that material force could reach they were graven in the invisible mind yet all aspired to material dominion and to secure them that dominion the peoples of the world have poured out their best blood idols of religions and of nationality the idol of liberty whose reign was established in europe by the armies of the at the point of the bayonet the masters have changed the slaves are still the same our century has made the acquaintance of two new species the idol of race at first the outcome of noble ideas became in the laboratories of spectacled savants the moloch which germany herself hurled against franc in 1870 and which her enemies now wish to use against the germany of today the latest on the scene is that authentic product of german science fraternally allied to the labors of industry of commerce and of the firm of idol of kultur surrounded by its levites the thinkers of germany 105 106 107 108 109 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https common feature of the cult of all idols is the adaptation of an ideal to the evil instincts of mankind man cultivates the vices which are profitable to him but feels the necessity of legitimizing them being unwilling to sacrifice them he must idealize them that is why the problem at which he has never ceased to labor throughout the centuries has been to harmonize his ideals with his own mediocrity he has always succee ded the crowd has difficulty here it sets side by side its virtues and its vices its heroism and its meanness the force of its passions and the rapid course of the days which carry it along cause it to get its lack of logic but the intelligent few can not satisfy themselves with so little effort not that they are is often said less readily swayed by passion this is grave error the richer life becomes the more does it offer passion to devour and history sufficiently shows the terrifying paroxysms to which the lives of religious leaders and revolutionaries have attained but these toilers in the spirit love careful work and are repelled by popular modes of thought which perpetually break through the meshes of reasoning they have to make more closely woven net in which instinct and idea cost what it may combine to form stouter tissue they thus achieve monstrous give an intellectual any ideal and any evil passion and he will always succeed in harmonizing the twain the love of god and the love of mankind have been invoked in order to burn kill and pillage the fraternity of 1793 was sister to the holy guillotine we have in our time seen churchmen seeking and finding in the gospels the justification of banking and of war since the outbreak of the war clergyman of würtember g established the fact that neither christ nor john the baptist nor the apostles desir ed to suppr ess militarism 23 clever intellectual is conjuror in ideas nothing in my up my the great trick is to extract from any given idea its precise from the sermon on the mount or like professor ostwald the military dictatorship of the kaiser from the dream of an intellectual internationalism such conjurors these things are but child play let us expose them by examining the words of this ostwald who has appeared during the last few months the baptist of the gospel of the spiked helmet here is the idol to begin kultur made in germany with capital k rectiligne et quatr pointes comme un chevel frise miguel unamuno wrote to all around are little gods the child ren of its loins kulturstaat kulturbund kulturimperium i am now it is the voice of ostwald 24 going to explain to you the great secret of germany we or rather the germanic race have discover ed the factor of organization other peoples still live under the régime of individualism while we are under that of organization the stage of or ganization is mor advanced stage of civilization it is surely clear that like those missionaries who in order to carry the christian faith to heathen peoples secure the of squadron and landing party which straightway establish in the idolatrous country commercial stores protected by ring of cannon german intelligence can not without selfishness keep her treasures to herself she is obliged to share them germany wishes to organize europe europe has hitherto not been organized with us everything tends to elicit from each individual the maximal output in the direction most favorable society that us is liberty in its highest we may well pause to marvel at this way of talking about human culture though it were question of asparagus and artichokes of this happiness and these advantages this maximal output this culture this liberty of artichokes subjected to judicious forcing process professor ostwald does not wish to deprive the other peoples of europe they are so unenlightened not to acquiesce with enthusiasm war will make them participate in the form of this organization in our higher civilization 110 111 112 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https the who is also in his leisure hours politician and strategist sketches in bold outline the picture of the victories of germany and remodeled united states of europe under the paternal sceptre of his mailed kaiser england crushed france disarmed and russia dismembered his colleague haeckel completes this joyous exposé by dividing belgium the british empire and the north of perrette of the fable before her pitcher broke unfortunately neither haeckel nor ostwald tells us if their plan the establishment of this higher civilization included the destruction of the halle of ypres of the library at louvain of the cathedral at rheims after all these conquests divisions and devastations let us not overlook this wonderful sentence of which ostwald certainly did not realize the sinister buffoonery worthy of molière y know that i am pacifist however far the high priests of cult may allow their emotion to carry them their profession of faith still retains certain diplomatic reserve which does not hamper their followers thus the kulturmenschen but the zeal of their levites must frequently disturb the serenity of moses and and its intemperate frankness i not know what they think of the article of thomas mann which appeared in the november number of the neue rundschau gedanken im kriege but i know what certain french intellectuals will think of it germany could not offer them more terrible weapon against herself in an access of delirious pride and exasperated fanaticism mann employs his envenomed pen to justify the worst accusations that have been made against germany while an ostwald endeavors to identif y the cause of kultur with that of civilization mann proclaims they have nothing in common the present war is that of kultur of germany against civilization and pushing this outrageous boast of pride to the point of madness he defines civilization reason vernunft aufklärung gentleness sittigung sänftigung spirit geist auflösung and kultur spiritual organization of the world which does not exclude bloody savagery kultur is the sublimation of the demoniacal die sublimierung des dämonischen it is above morality above reason and above science while ostwald and haeckel see in militarism merely an arm or instrument of which kultur makes use to secure victory thomas mann affirms that kultur and militarism are ideal is the same their aim the same their principle the same their enemy is peace is spirit ja der geist ist zivil ist bürgerlich he finally dares to inscribe on his own and his country banner the words law is the friend of the weak it would reduce the world to level war brings out strength gesetz ist der fr eund des schwachen möchte gern die w elt verflachen aber der krieg lässt die kraft erscheinen in this criminal glorification of violenc thomas mann himself has been surpassed ostwald preached the victory of kultur if necessary by force mann proved that kultur is force some one was needed to cast aside the last veil of reserve and say force alone all else be silent we have read extrac ts from the cynical article in which maximilian harden treating the desperate efforts of his government to excuse the violation of belgian neutrality feeble lies dared to write why on earth all this fuss might creates our right did powerful man ever submit himself to the crazy pr etensions or to the judgment of band of weaklings what testimony to the madness into which german intelligence has been precipitated by pride and struggle and to the mora l anarchy of this empire whose organization is imposing only to the eyes of those who not see farther than the façade who can not see the weakness of government which gags its socialist press and yet tolerates such an insulting contradiction this who does not see that such words defame germany before the whole world centuries to come these miserable intellectuals imagine that with their display of infuriated nietzche ism and bismarckism they are acting heroically and impressing the world they merely disgust it they wish to be believed people are 113 114 115 116 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https too ready to believe them the whole of germany will be made responsible the delirium of few writers germany will one day realize she has had more deadly enemy than her own intellectuals i write here without prejudice i am certainly not proud of our french intellectuals the idol of race or of civilization or of latinity which they so greatly abuse does not satisfy i not like any even that of humanity but at any rate those to which my country bows down are less dangerous they are not aggressive and moreover there remains even in the most fanatical of our intellectuals basis of native common sense of which the germans of whom i have just spoken seem to have lost all trace but it must be admitted that on neither side have they brought honor to the cause of reason which they have not been able to protect against the winds of violence and folly there is saying of emerson which is applicable to their failure nothing is mor rar in any man than an act of his their acts and their writings have come to them from others from outside from public opinion blind and menacing i not wish to condemn those who have been obliged to remain silent either because they are in the armies or because the censorship which rules in countries involved in war has imposed silence upon them but the weakness with which the leaders of thought have everywhere abdicated to the collective madness has certainly proved their lack of character certain somewhat paradoxical passages in my own writings have caused at times to be styled an an absurd charge to bring against one who has given his life to the worship of thought but it is true that intellectualism has often appeared to mere caricature of mutilated deformed and petrified powerless not only to dominate the drama of life but even to understand it and the events of have proved more in the right than i wished to be the intellectual lives too much in the realm of shadows of ideas ideas have existence in themselves but only through the hopes or experiences which can fill them they are either summaries or hypotheses frames what has been or will be convenient or necessary formulæ one can not live and act without them but the evil is that people make them into oppressive realities one contributes more to this than the intellectual whose trade it is to handle them who biased by his profession is always tempted to subordinate reality to them let there supervene collective passion which completes his blindness and it will be cast in the form of the idea which can best serve its purpose it transfers its to that idea and the idea magnifies and glorifies it in turn nothing is more in man than phantom which his own mind has created phantom in which are combined the madness of his heart and the madness of his head hence the intellectuals in the present crisis have not been overcome by the warlike contagion less than others but they have themselves contributed to spreading it i would add it is their punishment that they are victims of the contagion longer period whilst simple folk constantly submit to the test of action and of experience and modify their ideas without conscious regret the intellectual finds himself bound in the net of his own creation and every word that he writes draws the bonds tighter hence while we see that in the soldiers of all armies the fire of hate is rapidly dying down and that they already fraternize from trench to trench the writers redouble their furious arguments we can easily prophesy that when the remembrance of this senseless war has passed away among the people its bitterness will still be smouldering in the hearts of the intellectuals who shall break the idols who shall open the eyes of their fanatical followers who shall make them understand that god of their minds religious or secular has the right to force himself on other human he who seems the most to

immediate end of the war by peace at any price on the one hand it declares itself it has formed presumptuous idea of its strength it has naïve confidence in vague peace formulæ nor even in defined

ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https after the european war had broken out several groups of intellectuals belonging to the warring nations have advocated the justice of their country cause in manifestoes and pamphlets which they have scattered in great numbers throughout the neutral states 25 and this still goes on side by side with the war of the sword less vehement war is carried on with the pen those writings have also reached us the undersigned all subjects of neutral state we have read them with the greatest interest they enable us to form clear opinion not only of the frame of mind brought about by the outbreak of the war among the intellectuals of the warring nations but also of the opinions they hold about the causes and the nature of the present war it has not surprised us neutrals to see that the spokesmen of the opposing nations are equally convinced of the justice of their cause neither has it surprised us that those spokesmen evince such strong inclination to advocate their rights before the neutral states indeed in such terrible struggle it is psychologic necessity all the nations concerned that they should believe implicitly in the justice of their cause they must ardently desire to testify to their faith before others only an unshakable confidence in the absolute justice of their cause can keep them from wavering or despairing during the gigantic struggle but we have perceived with great sorrow that the greater part of those writings are absolutely lacking in the slightest effort to be just towards opponents that the meanest and most malicious motives are ascribed to them we respect the conviction of every one of the warring nations that they are fighting just cause even if we should have formed an opinion about the origin of the war we should yet not think the present fit moment to oppose different opinions or arguments to each other this should be the work of the future when scientific research will be able to consider all the facts quietly when national passions will have subsided and the nations will listen with more composure to the verdict of history yet we think it our duty and we consider it privilege given to us neutrals to utter serious warning against the systematic rousing of lasting bitterness between the now warring parties though fully aware that the late events have irritated the feeling of nationality to the utmost yet we believe that patriotism should not prevent any one from doing justice to the character of one enemy that faith in the virtues of one own nation need not be coupled with the idea that all vices are inherent in the opposing nation that confidence in the justice of one own cause should not make one forget that the other side cherishes that conviction with the same ener gy besides one should forget that the question what nations will be enemies depends on political relations which vary according to unexpected circumstances today enemy may be tomorrow friend the tone in which of late not only the papers to which we have referred above but also the newspaper press of the warring nations has written about the enemy threatens to arouse and to perpetuate the bitterest hatred to the evils directly resulting from the war will be added the regrettable consequence that between the belligerent nations in art science and all other labors of peace will be delayed some time nay even made quite impossible yet the time will come after this war when the nations will have to resume some form of intercourse social well spiritual the fewer fierce accusations have been breathed on either side the less one nation has attacked the character of the other in short the less lasting bitterness has been roused so much the easier will it be afterwards to take up again the broken threads of international intercourse 131 132 133 134 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https rousing of hatred and bitterness is also an impediment in the way that leads our thoughts towards peace every one who in word or writing rails at the enemy or excites national passions is responsible the longer duration of this horrible war therefore we the undersigned appeal to all those of the same mind especially among those belonging to the warring nations to this purpose that in word and writing everything be avoided that may rouse lasting animosity we especially address this appeal to those who influence public opinion in their own country to men of science and to artists to those who long ago have realized that in all civilized countries there

spreading hatred and violence abroad that even if they wished they could not bring it back again into control the damage is irreparable it is possible that the neutral countries of europe and the

must expect from this too tardy intervention in any case i see another outlet our activity let the war be what it can longer intervene but at least we must try to make the scour ge productive of

freunde nicht diese töne in which he implored the artists and thinkers of europe to save what little peace might yet be saved and not to join with their pens in destroying the future of europe since then he has written some beautiful poems one of which an invocation to peace is inspired with deep feeling and classical simplicity and will find its way to many an oppressed heart jeder hat gehabt keiner hat geschätzt jeden hat der süsse quell gelabt wie klingt der name friede jetzt klingt so fern und zag klingt so tränenschwer keiner weiss und kennt den tag jeder sehnt ihn vol verlangen her each one possessed it but one prized it like cool spring it refreshed us all what sound the word peace has us now distant it sounds and fearful and heavy with tears one knows or can name the day which all sigh with such longing the attitude of the younger reviews is curious whereas the older traditional reviews those which correspond to our revue des deux mondes or our revue paris are more or less affected by military instance the neue rundschau which printed thomas mann notorious vagaries on culture and civilization gedanken im kriege of the younger ones af fect haughty detachment from actual events that impassive publication blätter für die kunst over which broods the invisible personality of stefan geor ge published at the end of 1914 volume of poems of 156 pages which did not contain single line referring to the war note at the end affirms that the points of view of the various authors have not changed on account of recent events and anticipates the objection that this is not the time poetry by the saying of jean paul period has so much need of poetry the one which thinks it can without it die aktion vibrating audacious berlin review with an point of view totally different from the calm impersonality of blätter für die kunst stated in its issue of august 15 1914 that it would not concern itself with politics but would contain only literature and art and if it finds room in its literary columns the war poems sent from the field of battle by the military doctors wilhelm klemm and hans kock it is in 157 158 159 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain

hasse at the criminal poets who stir up hatred with their false stories and at professor haeckel the dilettantism of this review is extreme its weekly issues contain translations from the french of andré gide péguy and léon bloy and reproductions of the works of daumier delacroix cézanne matisse and la fresnaye cubism flourishes in this berlin review the issue of october 24th is devoted to péguy and contains frontispiece egon schiele portrait of the man who is honored by franz pfemfert the editor the purest and most vigorous moral force in french literature of today let us hasten to add however that is often the case on the other side of the rhine they are carried away by their zeal in deploring his death of one of their countrymen and in proclaiming themselves his heirs but the pride which admires is at least superior to the pride which disparages the most important of these young reviews is die weissen blätter important on account of the variety of questions it deals with and the value and numb er of its contributors well the of its schickele an alsatian by birth he belongs to those who feel most acutely the bitterness of the present struggle after an interval of three months die weissen blätter which almost corresponds to our nouvelle revue française reappeared in january last with the following declaration akin to that of the revue des nations at berne it seems good to us to begin the work of reconstruction in the midst of the war and to aid in preparing the victory of the spirit the community of europe is at present appar ently destr oyed is it not the duty of all of us who are not bearing arms to live from today onwar ds accor ding to the dictates of our conscience it will be the duty of every german when once the war is over by the side of these disinterested manifestoes about actual politics appear lengthy historical novels tycho brahé by max brod and satirical comedies by carl sternheim who continues to scour ge the upper classes of german society and the capitalists die weissen blätter is open to all questions of the day but in spite of the actual differences which must necessarily exist between german and french review we can not but point out the frankly hostile attitude of these writers to all the excesses of chauvinism the articles of max scheler europe and the war show an impartial attitude which is entirely praiseworthy the review opens its columns to the loyal annette kolb who the daughter of german father and of french mother suffers keenly in this conflict between the parts of her nature and has lately raised tempest in dresden where in public lecture she had the courage to admit her fidelity to both sides and to express her regret that germany should fail to understand france in the february number under the title ganz niedrich hängen there appeared violent repudiation of the krieg mit dem maul the war of tongues if journalists hope to inspir courage by insulting the enemy they are refuse such stimu lants we dare to maintain our opinion that the humblest volunteer of the enemy who from an unreasoned but exalted sentiment of patriotism fires upon us from an ambush knowing well what he risks is much superior to those journalists who profit by the public feeling of the day and under cover of sounding wor ds of patriotism not fight the enemy but spit upon of all these young writers who are striving to preserve the integrity of their minds against the force of national passions the one whose personality has been most exalted by this tempest the most eloquent courageous and decided of all is wilhelm herzog he is the editor of the forum at munich and like our own péguy when he began to publish his cahiers la quinzaine he fills almost the whole of his review with his own burning articles the enthusiastic biographer of von kleist he sees and judges the events of his own time with the eyes of that indomitable spirit the german censor attempts in vain to silence him and to forbid the publication of the lectures of spitteler and of annette kolb his indignation and cries of vengeful irony spread even to us he attacks bitterly the intellectuals who fancy they are all ajaxes because they bray the loudest those politicians of the school of haeckel who make new division of the world those patriotic bards who insult other nations he attacks thomas mann mercilessly scoffs at 160 161

germany grünwald dürer bach and mozart amongst others have always been persecuted humiliated and calumniated 34 in an article entitled der neue geist 35 after having scoffed at the banality that has reappeared in the german theaters and the literary mediocrity of patriotic productions he asked where this new spirit may be found and this gives him an oppo rtunity to demolish ostwald and lasson

he knows that he is enriched thereby made str onger mor tender mor humane 36 and he quotes the words of old meister eckehart suffering is the fastest steed that will bear you to at the close of this summary review of the young writers of the war place must be found those whom the war has crush counted amongst the best ernst stadler was an enthusiastic admirer of french art and of the french spirit he translated francis jammes and on the eve of his death in november he was writing to stefan zweig from the trenches about the poems of verlaine which he was translating the unfortunate geor ge trakl the poet of melancholy was made lieutenant of sanitary column in galicia and the sight of so much suffering drove him to despair and death and there are many hidden tragedies still unrevealed when they are made known humanity will tremble in contemplating its handiwork i reflected doubtless many of my french readers have also done in reading through these german writings inspired by the through which from time to time there passes mighty breath of revolt and our young writers are not writing literature instead of books they give us deeds and their letters and in ing some of their letters i thought that ours had chosen the better part it is not now to point out the position that this heroic correspondence will occupy not only in our history but also in our literature into it the flower of our youth has put all its life its faith and its genius and some of those letters i would give many of the finest lines of the noblest poems whatever be the result of this war and the opinion to its value later it will be recognized that france has written on paper and often blotted with blood some of its sublimest pages assuredly this war touches us more nearly than it does our adversaries who of us would have the heart to write play or novel whilst his country is in danger and his brothers dying but i will make comparisons between the two nations the present the essential thing is to show that even in germany there are certain finer minds who are fighting against the spirit which we spirit of grasping imperialism and inhum an pride of military caste and the megalomania of pedants they are but have 164 165 166 167 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https about we ought to redouble our efforts on that account to vanquish the common enemy why then should we trouble to make these generous but feeble voices heard because their merit is the greater being so little heeded because it is the duty of those who are fighting justice to render justice in their turn to all those men even when they dwell in country in whic h the state represents the violation of right by faustr echt who are defending with us the spirit of liberty journal genève april 19 xv the m urder of the élite the phrase is not today 37 but the fact is never in any period have we seen humanity throwing into the bloody arena all its intellectual and moral reserves its priests its thinkers its scholars its artists the whole future of the its geniuses food cannon great thing doubtless when the struggle is great when people fights an eternal cause the fervor of which fires the whole nation from the smallest to the greatest when it fuses all the egoisms purifies desire and out of many souls makes one unanim ous soul but if the cause be suspect or if it is tainted we judge that of our adversaries to be what will be the situation of moral élite which has preserved the sad and lofty privilege of perceiving at least part of the truth and which must nevertheless fight and die and kill faith which it doubts those passionate natures that are intoxicated by fighting or are voluntarily blinded by the necessities of action are not troubled by these questions them the enemy is single mass nothing else exists them but this they have to break it it is their function and their duty and to each his special duty but if minorities not exist such men they exist us who since we are not fighting have the libert y and the duty to see every aspect of the we who form part of the eternal minority the minority which has been is and always will be eternally oppressed it is us to hear and to proclaim these moral sufferings plenty of others repeat or invent the jubilant echoes of the struggle may other voices be raised to give the tragic accents of the fight and its sacred horror i shall take my examples from the enemy camp several reasons because the german cause being from the first tainted with injustice the sufferings of the few who are just and the still fewer who have spiritual perceptions are greater there than elsewhere because these evidences appear openly in publications whose boldness the german censorship has not perceived because i bow with respect to the heroic discipline of silence which france in fighting imposes on her sufferings would to god that this silence were not broken by those who trying to deny these sufferings profane the grandeur of the sacrifice by the revolting levity of their silly jests in newspape rs which are without either gravity or dignity i have shown in the last chapter that part of the intellectual youth of germany was far from sharing the of its elders i cited certain energetic reproofs delivered by these young writers to the theorists of imperialism and these writers are not

who not set out in any way except the group of stefan geor ge to write select wish to write all i stated too that the boldest review of all wilhelm herzog forum was read in the german trenches and received approbation thence 168 169 170 171 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https what is more astonishing this spirit of criticism has possessed some of the combatants and even made its appearance among german officers in the november december number of the arte published in berlin vienna and leipzig by alfred fried there occurs an appeal to the germanic peoples addressed at the end of october by baron marschall von biberstein landrat of prussia and captain in the 1st foot guards reserve this article was written in trench north of arras where on the 11th of november biberstein was killed he expresses unreservedly his horror of the war and his ardent desire that it may be the last that is the conviction of those at the front who are witnesses of the unspeakab le horrors of modern warfar even more praiseworthy is biberstein frankness when he decides to begin confession and mea culpa the sins of germany the war has opened my eyes he says to our terrible unlovableness unbeliebtheit everything has its cause we must have given cause this hatred and even in part have justified it let us hope that it will not be the least of the advantages of this war that germany will turn round on herself will search out and recognize her faults and correct unfortunately even this article is spoiled by germanic pride which desiring world peace sets out to impose it on the world herein it recalls in some respects the bellicose pacifism of the too celebrated ostwald but another officer of whom i spoke in my last chapter the poet fritz von unruh first lieutenant of uhlans on the western front has written dramatic scenes in verse and prose these have appeared recently under the title befor the decision vor der entscheidung it is dramatic poem in which the author has noted his own impressions and his moral transformations the hero who like himself is an officer of uhlan s passes through various centers of the war and remains everywhere stranger his soul is detached from murderous passions he sees the abominable reality until his sufferings from it amount to agony the two scenes reproduced by the neue zürcher zeitung show us muddy and bloodstained trench where german soldiers like beasts in slaughter house die or await death with bitter officers getting drunk on champagne around 42mm mortar laughing and getting excited till they fall beneath the weight of sleep and fatigue from the first scene i take these terrible words of one of those who wait in the trenches under fire of the machine guns dreissigjæhriger man of thirty in my village they are drink to each victory they slaughter us like butcher they say it war when it is over they are fools they will feast us three years but the first cripple wo be grey headed before they will laugh at his white hairs and the uhlan possessed by horror in the midst of the massacre falls on his knees and prays thou who gavest life and takest shall i recognize thee in these trenches strewn with mutilated bodies i find thee not does the piercing cry of these thousands suffocated in the terrible embrace of death reach not up to thee or is it lost in frozen space whom does thy springtime blossom whom is the splendor of thy suns whom god i ask it of thee in the name of all those whose mouths are closed by courage and by fear in face of the horror of thy darkness what

are perhaps the most striking pages from the point of view of artistic quality and power of thought i will only give two extracts from these letters which are likely to be of special interest to french readers the first describes us with an unusual frankness the moral condition of the german army 172 173 174 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https without care his own life who is there among us that is that we all know too well our own worth and our own possibilities we are in the flower of our age force is in our arms and in our souls and one willingly dies one is brave tapfer in the usual sense of the word or at least such are very rare it is just because bravery is so rare in life it is just that that we expend so much religion poetry and thought and this begins already at school in celebrating the highest fate death one fatherland until it attains its climax in the false heroism which makes such sensation about us in newspapers and speeches and which is so also in the true heroism of small number who risk themselves and lead on the others we our duty we what we ought but it is passive virtue when i read in the papers the scribblings of those who have bad conscience because they are safely in the i read this talk which makes every soldier into hero i feel hurt heroism is rare growth and you can not build on it citizen army to keep such an army together the men must respect their superiors and even fear them more than the enemy and the superiors must be conscientious their duty well know their business thoroughly decide rapidly and have control of their nerves when we read the praises which those behind the line write of us we blush thank god robust shame is not dead in us ah my dear friends those who are here speak so complacently of death of disease of sacrifice and of victory those who behind the line ring the bells make speeches and write newspapers the men here accustom themselves best they may to the bitter necessity of suffering and of death if fate wills but they know and see that many noble sacrifices innumerable innumerable sacrifices have already been made and that already long while we shall have had more than enough of destruction on our side well the other it is precisely when one has to look suffering in the face i have that tie begins to be formed that unites one to those over there on the other side and one that unites you too with them my friends yes surely you feel it too you if i come back from here which i scarcely hope any more my dearest duty will be to soak myself in the study and the thoughts of those who have been our enemies i wish to reconstruct my nature on wider basis and i believe that it will be easier after this war than after any other to be human being the second fragment is the account of touching encounter with french prisoner yesterday evening i was strangely touched i happened to see convoy of prisoners and i talked to one of them colleague of mine professor of classical philology in the college of such an intelligent man and with such fine military bearing like all his fellows although they had just been through terrible experience of fire it was proof to of the senselessness of the war i thought how much one would have liked to be the friend of these men who are so near us in their education their mode of life the circle of their thought and their interest we started talking about book on rousseau and we began to dispute like old philologists how much we are alike in force and worth and how little truth there is in what our papers tell us of the shaken and exhausted conditions of the french troops true or rather untrue what the french newspapers write about us my french colleague showed in his remarks such balanced mind and such understanding and admiration of german thought to think that we were made so clearly to be friends and that we had to be separated i was altogether overcome and sat down crushed by it i thought and thought and could not escape my mood by any sophistry end end to war which nearly six months now has swallowed in its gulf men fortunes and happiness and this feeling is the same with us with the other side it is always the same picture we the same thing we suffer the same thing we are the same thing and it is precisely this reason that we are so bitterly at enmity the same accent of troubled anguish together with despair which at moments nearly reaches to madness and at others breathes religious fervor are seen in the letters of german soldier to teacher in german switzerland we have known of these at the prisoners agency three or four months and they were published in et vie of april 15th 39 they have been passed over in silence so we shall persist in calling attention to them they thoroughly deserve it in these letters which cover from the second fortnight of august to the end of december we see from the 25th of august onwards the evidence of desire peace among the german soldiers we all even those who were hottest the fight at the beginning want nothing now but peace our officers just much ourselves convinced we are of the necessity to conquer warlike enthusiasm does

one almost hears the voice of tolstoi what are all the torments of war compared to the thoughts that obsess us night and day when i am on some hill from which my view commands the plain this is the idea which ceaselessly tortures down there in the valley the war rages those brown lines which furrow the landscape are full of men who are facing one another enemies and up there on the hill opposite you there is perhaps man who like you is contemplating the woods and the blue sky and perhaps ruminating the same thoughts you his enemy this continual proximity might make one mad and one is tempted to envy one comrades who can kill time in sleeping and playing cards december 17th the desire peace is intense in every one at least in all those who are at the front and who are obliged to assassinate and be assassinated the newspapers say that it hardly possible to restrain the warlike ardor of the fighters they or unconsciously our chaplains in their sermons dispute the legend that our military ardor is slackening you can hardly believe how such annoys us let them be silent and let them not talk about things of which they can know nothing or better still let them come not almoners who keep to the rear but into the rifle in hand perhaps then they will get to know of the inner changes which take place in so many of us according to these chaplains any one who is without warlike enthusiasm is not man such our age demands to it seems that we are greater heroes than the others we who without being upheld by warlike enthusiasm accomplish faithfully our duty while hating war with our whole souls they talk of holy war i know of holy war i only know of one war which is the sum of all that is inhuman impious and bestial in man it is god chastisement and call to repentance the people that throws itself into war or lets itself be drawn into it god sends men through this hell so that they may learn to love heaven the german people this war seems to to be punishment and call to repentance most of all our german church i have friends who suffer at the idea of being unable to anything the fatherland let them stay at home with calm conscience all depends on their peaceful work but let the war enthusiasts come perhaps they will learn to keep silent why publish these pages i shall be asked by some people in france what good is it when once war is let loose to arouse pity our adversaries at the risk of blunting the ardor of the combatants answer because it is the truth and because the truth substantiates our judgment the judgment of the whole world

still more deeply their masters from the depths of the battlefie ld these voices of sacrificed minority rise up vengeful condemnation of the oppressors to the accusations drawn up against predato ry

bad shepherds who let loose this war have led and constrained into murder and madness to sacrifice one body is not the worst suffering but also to sacrifice to deny to kill one own soul who die at least just cause and who full of sap and loaded with faith fall like ripe fruit how sweet is your lot beside this torture but we shall so act that these sufferings shall not be vain let the conscience

past and present spread out on the good soil of france matured beneath our western skies the mysterious chance which combines elements and forces will not easily produce noble spirit like his second time jaurès is type almost unique in modern times of the great political orator who is also great thinker and who combines vast culture with penetrating observation and moral grandeur with energetic activity we must go back to antiquity to find one who like him could stir the crowd and give pleasure to the few pour out his overflowing genius not only in his speeches and social treatises but also in his philosophical and historical works 40 and leave on all things the impress of his personality the furrow of his robust labor the seeds of his progressive mind i have listened to him often in the chamber at socialist congresses at meetings held on behalf of oppressed nations he even did the honor of presenting my danton to the people of paris again i see his full face calm and happy like that of kindly bearded ogre his small eyes bright and smiling eyes quick to follow the flight of ideas to observe human nature i see him pacing up and down the platform walking with heav y steps like bear his arms crossed behind his back and turning sharply to hurl at the crowd in his monotonous metallic voice words like the call of trumpet which reached the farthest seats in the vast amphitheatre and went straight to the heart making the soul of the whole multitude leap in one united emotion what beauty there was in the sight of these proletarian masses stirred by the visions which jaurès evoked from distant horizons imbibing the thought of greece through the voice of their tribune of all this man gifts the most fundame ntal was to be essentially the man of single profession or class or party or complete harmonious and free man his nature could be the slave of nothing the highest manifestations of life flowed together and met in him his intelligence demanded unity 41 his heart was full of passion liberty 42 and this twofold instinct protected him alike from party despotism and anarchy his spirit sought to encompass all things not in order to violence to them but to bring them into harmony above all he had the power of seeing the human element in all things and this universal sympathy was equally averse to narrow negation and fanatical affirmation all intolerance inspired him with horror 43 he had put himself at the head of great revolutionary party but it was with the desire of saving the great work of democratic revolution from the sickening and brutal odor of blood murder and hatred which still clings to the memory of the revolution in his own name and in the name of his party he demanded with regard to all doctrines respect the human personality and the spirit which is manifested in each the mere feeling of the moral antagonism which exists between man and man even when there is open conflict the sense of the invisible barriers which render human brotherhood impossible was painful to him he could not read those words of cardinal newman in which he speaks of the gulf of damnation which even in this life is fixed between men without having sort of nightmare he saw the abyss ready to gape beneath the feet of fragile and unhappy human beings who think themselves bound together by community of sympathy and suffering sadness of this thought obsessed him to fill in this abyss of misunderstanding was his herein lay the originality of his standpoint that although he was the spokesman of the most advanced parties he became the continual mediator between conflicting ideas he sought to unite them all in 182 183 184 185 the project gutenberg ebook of above the battle by romain rolland https service of progress and of the comm on good in philosophy he united idealism and history the past and the politics the love of his own country and respect other countries 44 he refrained from denouncing that which has been in the name of that which is to be many have done and far from condemning he upheld the theories of all those who had been fighters in past centuries to whatever party they might have belonged we reverence the past he said not in vain have blazed the hearths of all the generations of it is we who are advancing who are fighting new ideal it is we who are the true inheritors of the hearth of our ancestors we have taken the flame thereof you have preserved only the ashes january 1909 in his introduction to socialiste la révolution in which he attempts to reconcile plutarch michelet and karl marx he writes we hail with equal respect all men of heroic will history even when conceived study of economic forms will never dispense with individual valor and nobility the moral level of society tomorrow will be determined by the standard of morality of conscience today so that to offer the examples of all the heroic fighters who the past century have been inspired by an ideal and held death in sublime contempt is to revolutionary work in everything he touches he achieves generous synthesis of life he imposes his grand panoramic conception of the universe the sense of the manifold and moving unity of all things this admirable equilibrium of countless elements presupposes in the man who achieves it magnificent health of body and of mind mastery of his whole being and jaurès possessed this mastery and because of it he was the pilot of european democracy how clear and far reaching was his foresight in years to come when the record of the war of today is set down he will appear therein terrible witness was there anything he did not foresee one needs only to read through his speeches during the last ten years 45 it is yet too early in the midst of the conflict to quote freely his predictions concerning the coming retribution let us recall only his agonized presentim ent ever since the year 1905 of the monstrous war which was imminent 46 his consciousness of the antagonism now muffled now acute but always profound and terrible between germany and england november 18 1909 47 his denunciation of the secret dealings of european finance and diplomacy dealings which are encouraged by the torpor of public spirit his cry of alarm at the sensational lies of the press actuated by the rotten system of capitalism sowing panic and hatred and playing cynically with the lives of millions of men through mere financial considerations or delirious pride his contemptuous words those whom he calls the jockeys of his country his clear perception of all responsibilities 48 his foreknowledge of the domesticat ed attitude which would be adopted in case of war by the party of germany to whom he showed in mirror at the amsterdam congress in 1904 their haughty weakness their lack of revolutionary tradition their want of parliamentary strength their formidable powerlessness 49 of the attitude which certain leaders of french socialism too and amongst others jules guesde would maintain in the conflict between the great states of europe 50 and looking even beyond the war his premonition of the consequences near and remote national and international of this conflict of nations how would he have acted had he lived the proletariat of europe looked to him guidance and had faith in huysmans has said so in the speech delivered at his grave in the name of the workers international 51 there can be doubt that when he had fought against the war until all hope of preventing it was gone he would have yielded loyally to the common duty of national defense and taken part in it with all his might he had announced this point of view at the congress in stuttgart in 1907 in full agreement therein with vandervelde and bebel if whatever the circumstances nation were to refuse from the outset to defen d itself it would be entirely at the mercy of the governments of violence barbarism and reaction unity of mankind which was the result of the absorption of conquered

his human ideals and watching with untiring eyes every opportunity of reconstructing the shattered unity certainly he would not have allowed the vessel of socialism to drift his feeble successors have done he has passed from us but the reflecti on of his luminous genius his kindness in the bitter struggle his indestructible optimism even in the midst of disaster shine above the carnage of europe over which the dusk is gathering like the splendor of the setting sun there is one page which he wrote which can not be read without immortal page in which he represents the noble herakles resting after his labors on the maternal earth there are hours he says when in feeling the earth beneath our feet we expe rience joy deep and tranquil the earth herself how often on my journey along footpaths and across fields i have realized suddenly that it was indeed the earth on which i trod that i belonged to her she belonged to then without thinking i went more slowly because it was not worth while to hasten across her surface because i was conscious of her and possessed her at each step i took and my soul was moving within her depths how many times at the fall of day i lay by the side of ditch my eyes turne d towards the faint blue of the eastern sky i have suddenly realized that the earth was speeding on her journey hastening from the fatigues of the day and the limited horizons which the sun illumines and rushing with prodigious force towards the serenity of night and unlimited horizons and bearing with her i felt in my body in my soul and in the earth herself in my body the thrill of this journey and strange sweetness in those blue spaces which opened out before us without shock without fold without murmur oh how much deeper and more intense is this kinship of our flesh with the earth than the vague and wandering kinship of our eyes with the starry heavens how much less beautiful the night with its stars would be to us did we not feel ourselves at the same time bound to the earth he has returned to the earth which belonged to him that earth to which he belonged they have again taken posse ssion of each other and his spirit is even now warming and humanizing her beneath
