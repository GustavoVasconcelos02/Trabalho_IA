in summer when the trumpeter gadfly sounded his horn inviting all the insects in the forest to the butterfly s ball and the grasshopper s feast the sun shone brightly the air was mild and soft and the scent of the wild flowers delicious so that not one of the insects thought of staying at home butterflies beetles bees wasps snails grasshoppe rs ants all put on their best coats and frocks all put on their sweetest smiles and all hurried off in little bands to the ball talking and laughing and humming and buzzing by the way if they were the happiest creatures in the wide world even the old beetle that had been run over by and squeez ed nearly to death got out of bed when he heard what was going on and limped along with the rest though he had been confined to the house six months before one or two butterflies that were never known to go out except in the very finest weather even then carefully wrapped up to venture they were long in making up their minds about it one thought it looked very little like rain another feared that the light breez might give them cold howev er they put on great many cloaks and went from all directions they came and assembled on smooth grassy spot under an old where the revels were to take place some crawled slowly along the ground some bounded quickly over hill and dale some came running and tumbling jumping and hitting against things in their haste some came swiftly through the air and alighted so suddenly to tumble head over heels others flew quietly to the scene and flutte red lightly about admiring the gay compan y they were about to the butterﬂy ball by ballantyne https there came the beetle so blind and so black who carried the emmet his friend on his back and there came the gnat and the dr agonfly too and all their relations green or ange and blue the black beetle was the first to make his appear ance he carried his dear friend the emmet on his back and sad journey they had of it to be sure being very blind the beetle was constantly falling over twigs knocking his shins against the edges of leaves and tumbling into ditches so that the poor emmet had many terrible falls and once the great beetle fell on the top of him and crushed him good deal but it was very pleasant to see how cheerful they were under all this on getting up after fall the beetle always laughed so boisterously that the tears ran down his cheeks and his black sides nearly cracked while the little emmet said gaily ah my friend accidents will happen not hurt i hope come get along once more and then he jumped up on his friend s back again and way they went merrily ev er gnat and dragonfly with great many of their relations arrived about the same time with the beetle they looked quite charming in their brilliant dresses the colours of which were chiefly green orange and blue large fly with very light waistcoat and hat stuck on one side of his head said that the butterﬂy ball by ballantyne https were lovely and that miss gnat was quite killing this was an odd thing to say but mr meant by it that she was very beautiful indeed it was said that he fell in love with miss gnat he danced with nobody else during the whole afternoon and there came the moth with her plumage of down and the hornet with jack et of y ellow and brown who with him the w asp his companion did they promised that ev ening to la y by their sting the moth was sound asleep when the gadfly blew his trumpet she had sat up too late the night before and owing to having indulged this bad habit had overslept herself the following the butterﬂy ball by ballantyne https er she tried by her activity to make up lost time she saw the other insects hurrying past her house in crowds so she threw on her clothes fast possible the moth was prettily dressed in soft garment of down and she was modest creature every one loved her on leaving home she observ ed the wasp and the hornet passing they were dressed in rich suits of brown and yellow at sight of them she was little frightened and endea voured to run back to her house until they should pass by but they caught sight of her and immediately gave chase scream ing out loudly oh dear mrs moth pray don t be alarmed we have laid by our stings y and won t hurt they soon caught her although she ran fast she could so the wasp and the hornet each offered her an arm and obliged her to walk between them while they danced along shouting and singing and winking waggishly to the friends they passed on the road the poor moth blushed very much at being seen by all her friends in the compan y of two such wild creatures caterpillar and beetle besides one or two other insects that chanced to be near laugh ed very heartily on seeing what had happened but the moth soon recovered her spirits and when they arrived at the she was walking along with sprightly step first talking to the hornet and then chatting to the wasp if they were her dearest friends then the sly little dormouse peeped out of his hole and led to the feast his blind cousin the mole and the snail with her horns peeping out from her shell came fatigued with the distance the length of an the butterﬂy ball by ballantyne https come along you lazy fellow cried the little dormouse knocking with his cane at the door of ay ay cousin shouted the mole i ll be there in minute so the dormouse stood impatiently tapping his boots till the mole should be ready the dormouse was dressed in the height of fashion and thoug ht himself rather handsome fellow some people said that he was conceited and indeed spider that was near at hand plainly told him so but whether this was true or not there is doubt that he was very kind little fellow because he came to lead his poor blind cousin to the feast what time you have been old boy he said the mole appeared dusting the earth off his coat and white hat the mole answered that he had been very busy all morning making new tunnel between his and he then took his friend s arm and away they went over the green meadows where the cowslips and buttercups grew making the grass look if it were dotted all over with gold sometimes the two friends stopped by the way to rest under buttercup and sip little morning dew but seeing every one hastening past them while they wasted their time the dormouse jumped up again and cast sly look at his blind friend he asked him what he thought of the fine view don t mak jokes about m y being blind said the mole pretending to be angry just at that moment they both r an into spider s web oh how stupid of cried the dormouse i wasn t lookin g before at the you might well be without eyes if you don t use them said the mole they cleared away the threads of the net and making low bow to the spider went on their w ay now all this time the snail had been slowly creeping over the stones and winding round the blades of grass and flowers that strewed her path to the place of meeting but she was so long of getting there that the guests began to be impatient and said that perhaps she was not coming at all she lived under the next tree and had only about four feet to walk but she was so very the butterﬂy ball by ballantyne https that she took long long time to it and at last the grasshopper whispered to the butterfly that she should go and meet her away went the butterfly on her gaudy wings and alighting by the snail s side began to urge her to make haste during the butterfly s absence the wasp who was always making spiteful remarks said that it was shameful in the snail to keep them waiting but the who was walking up and down conversing with midge turned round and said remember you wasp that you have not brought your sting with you y so pray not give way to your spiteful nature the poor snail has to carry her house on her back so we should not be angry at her slowness some of the other insects said that this was excuse the snail because she knew that she walked very slowly and should therefore have set out sooner come come cried young frog jumping forward fightin g y ladies and gentlemen w have come here to be happ y and here comes the snail at last he spoke the butterfly flew towards them and the snail crawled in took off her bonnet put on her spectacles and sat down while the waiters bustled about placed stools the guests and brought in the the butterﬂy ball by ballantyne https mushroom the table and on it w spread leaf which their made the viands were v arious to each of their taste and the bee brought the honey to sweeten the feast it was perhaps the strangest that ever was seen there were such multitude of odd creatures of all shapes and sizes and colours some of whom were by nature bitter enemies and would have fought and killed each other had they met in the woods while taking walk but were quite civil and polite to one another now that they met guests in mrs butterfly s bower indeed many of them wished that they could be such good friends at all times they were then all the party had now arrived and there was great deal of talking and buzzing and humming and jesting they sat round the table and feasted on the good things placed before them the table was mushroom covered with of leaf and on it were placed all the delicious dishes of the woods the dormouse brought good deal of wheat oats and barley the squirrel brought bagful of nuts the brought quantit y of fine honey in the comb which was declared to be most excellent in short every one brought something or other so that when all was spread out beside the good things supplied by mrs butterfly and mr grasshopper it the butterﬂy ball by ballantyne https grandest feast that ever was heard of such fun there was to be sure and such multitude of v oices talking all at once my dear cried the butterfly across the table to the grasshopper i hope you are attending to your friends there see that you give them enough to eat and plenty of to drink yes yes my love replied the grasshopper well he could laughing at the jokes of bloated old spider that sat beside him then the grasshopper called to the butterfly to send him slice of wheat but the noise prevented his being heard he jumped over the table at one bound helped himself and bounded back again two or three young crickets and five or six midges sat at little side mushroom they made more noise than all the grownup people put together and the lady butterfly looked round at them with smile once or twice quite deligh ted to see them so happy and to hear their merry voices ringing through the woods with steps more majestic the snail did adv ance and he promised the gaz ers minuet dance but they all laughed so loudly he pulled in his head and went in his own little chamber to bed after dinner the ball began and it was the strangest ball that ever was seen the trumpeter gadfly and number of his relations besides several grasshoppers and bees were the chief musicians they wanted bass very much at first but the offered his services although he confessed that he was accustomed to sing alone then the gentlemen drew on their gloves flattened their wings pulled up their collars and coiled away their tails while the ladies tightened their the butterﬂy ball by ballantyne https their feathers and put out their feelers oh how they did dance reels were nothing to it the greatest difficult y was to keep the grasshoppers in order they became so excited that they sprang quite out of sight every moment and so lost their partners and ran against everybody in searching them then the who sang bass got little too much of the dew and sang so loudly that he quite drowned all the other players so mrs butterfly put her claws in her ears and running up to him said oh dear mr frog pray not sing quite so the poor was almost weeping with joy at the merry scene before him but he blushed very green on hearing this and said he had forgotten what he was doing but would try to be more careful howev er in five minutes more he was worse than ever so they sent few hundred bees to sing treble beside him and try to keep him in order in the middle of all this there was sudden stop and snail stepping forward offered to dance minuet this was receiv ed with such roar of laughter that the poor snail half frightened half angry drew in his horns and went to bed on the spot and the dance was begun anew by this time the gnats and midges and some of the other flies had left the ground and retired to enjoy cool dance in the air two or three spiders mounted up into the oak and fastened threads to some of the branches by which they dropped suddenly down among the dancers and seizing their partners round the waist carried them screaming in among the leaves so the fun and the noise became louder and louder on the ground under the bushes among the branches of the trees and in the air the dancers bounded skipped laughed sang shouted and flew in way that had never been seen or heard of before the merry old became quite absurd he sang and roared like lion took up all the young insects in his arms and hugged them tumbled over the other musicians and in short did so many wild things that they were at length obliged to tie him to paddock where they left him to enjo y himself then ev ening ga ve way to the shadows of night their w atchman the glow came out with his light so home let us hasten while y et we can see w atchman is w aiting y or the sun went down at last but still the dancers continued their sport under the old when suddenly clear beautiful light streamed across the turf it was the butterﬂy ball by ballantyne https g s light how charming exclaimed the butterfly it is such sweet subdued light rather too much subdued growled the blundering black beetle he tripped over twig and pulled his partner down with him couldn t you shine little brighter the shook his head couldn t give you another ray to save my life he said but if you send few of my friends they will be happy to come and help doubt good suggestion said the black beetle assisting his partner to rise oh m y poor frock cried the gazing sadly at long rent in the skirt never mind let s have at it again cried the beetle seizing her round the waist and blundering on again in furious gallop of his own in vention whom shall i send the s relations muttered the butterfly to herself send the snail said lively young cricket who had devoted himself to doing mischief during the whole ev ening peace little goose replied the butterfly tapping the cricket on the nose with her fan and hastening towards the grasshopper who was still enthr alled and convulsed b y the bloated old spider the butterﬂy ball by ballantyne https whom should we send my dear said the grasshopper in reply to the butterfly s question the fly footman to be sure and pray tell him to be smart about it i ve been run down en times already by the dancers since the sun set one lamp is too little our that blind mole has there he comes again look out he spoke the mole came bearing down towards them in furious portuguese waltz with horrified dr agonfly struggling in his arms the grasshopper made bound to get out of the way but at that moment the lively young cricket laid hold of his leg and held him fast the consequence was that the mole tumbled over him fell on the top of the bloated spider and hit his head so violently on the breast of the that he stopped his noise immediately this sudden stoppage of the bass brought the other musicians to stand and matter of course stopped the dancing abruptly the exception of deaf squirrel who had failed to find partner and who went on revolving slowly by himself if nothing had happened dear exclaimed ev erybody ex cept the squirrel what has happened oh nothing worth mentioning said the grasshopper getting up with limp you young r ascal what tak oh sobbed the young cricket pointing with look of surprise at the spider what sight he might well say so the bloated old spider had been flattened out by the weight of the mole to nearly twice her size and was apparently quite dead in great concern the host and hostess r an to r aise her are y hurt dear ask ed the butterfly anxiously hurt exclaimed the gr asshopper pushing her aside don t you see she s burst oh i m so sorry exclaimed the mole wringing his the butterﬂy ball by ballantyne https that moment there was shout of eager expectation the spider was seen to move the butterfly knelt at her side and bending down said tenderly tell dear has he burst y answered the spider faintly i m only let some of y y sides immediately dozen of the young crickets surrounded the old lady and pressed her sides with all their might this had the effect of raising her back little and enabling her to draw good long breath which speedily raised her up to her original siz there i m all right now she said in cheerful voice i m used to accidents of that sort and they never leave any bad effects beyond little stiffness of the lungs come grasshopper i ll finish that story get on with your dancing good people nobody inquires after croak ed the rubbing his chest i had idea mole s head w so hard have some said the butterfly gracefully handing him filled with the precious liquid it has been gathered on the scottish hills by native bee who has just arriv ed laden with heather the accepted the goblet and dr ained it to the bottom it is strong he said coughing and smacking his lips oo y observ ed the scotch bee it s got the credit bein wee thing nipp under the influence of the dew the began to sing bass lustily the other musicians chimed in the dancers seized each other by waist and by tail and wing those that happened to have waists or and the ball was about to go on when the gr asshopper stop your money or y our life added the liv ely young crick et silence pert monk ey us wait few moments my friends here come our lamps she spoke soft light was seen in the far distance gleaming upon the stems of the trees and steadily adv ancing your relations mr i presume said the butterfly in sweet silvery voice it is so very kind of you to send them and so obliging in them to come really i can not find words to express m y gratitude the countenance of the glow lighted up with pleasure at these words the drew near they appeared like great galaxy of minute if mass of the had been cut off and hurled down to earth there were several hundreds of them they approached the whole forest lighted up and when at last they desce nded upon the scene of the ball and ranged themselv es in circle round the gay party it seemed if the sun himself the butterﬂy ball by ballantyne https again to give them the radiance was softer and more mysteriously tender than that of the sun strong light has always an enlivening effect on creatures whether human or otherwise it cheered up the guests of mrs butterfly so much that they gave vent to an irresistible cheer called the music and went on to dancing with more zest and energy than ever insomuch that the attendant smiled to each other and nodded their heads now it happened that every time the smiled their light increased the lively young cricket observ ed this and began to wonder whether their light would increase still more if they were to laugh i ll try to find out said he going up to small apparently young and requesting her to step aside with him moment the little immediate ly became other words and went with him little w ay into the woods now said the liv ely young crick et stopping can y laugh what said the little glow smiling and of course lighting up yes that s it smile away but it harder i want you to laugh outright can t you laugh oh y es when there is an ything to laugh at well it now but i can t please then i ll mak so saying the young cricket seized the little round the waist and tickled her of course she laughed at first and to the cricket s delight her face became wonderfully bright moment but suddenly it became dim he hurt her and she began to cry you rascal exclaimed an angry voice the grasshopper gave the cricket kick that sent him head over heels into the grass i felt sure you were after mischief and i w right oh please don t kick him pleaded the little he didn t mean to hurt matter get up sir and beg her pardon the young cricket got up at once and did what he was bid he really did not mean mischief and was sorry he had hurt her and little miss rewarded him with smile so radiant that it illuminated the spot where they stood quite brilliantly and sparkled through her tears with r ainbow hues now i would laugh to please y if i could said miss glow again the butterﬂy ball by ballantyne https oh never mind my dear i ll make you and all your kindred laugh before the ball is over said the lively young cricket hurrying away and going straight up to the scotch bee who w clad in tartan plaid and kilt bee said the crick et can y dance the highland fling ay she can that i could show y better fling than the highland one said the crick et ho could y ye must be v erra cliver wull ye let her see t yes if you ll dance the highland fling first will you it if mrs butterfly asks you the scotch bee agreed of course the cricket had difficult y in persuading the hostess to ask him the musicians could not play reel but this mattered not the bee could hum to himself great was the delight and surprise of the compan y when they beheld the scotch bee twirling his legs snapping his fingers and humming the reel of tulloch while the tartans fluttered round him like shreds of shattered r ainbow the dance waxed more and more furious and the plaudits of the compan y grew louder when suddenly the lively young cricket ran in between the bee s legs tripped him up and sent him sprawling on the grass wild shout of laughter burst from the compan and the brightened up few moments if it had been set on fire that s the fling i spok of cried the crick et leaping up and running way the scotch bee sprang up drew his dirk and gave chase but mr grasshopper caught him b y the arm and dr agged him off ho this way don t sheathe your dirk i have haggis ready you to sheathe it in come along give your arm to that bloated old spider there she ll k eep y in spirits the bee was mollified he gave his arm to the spider then all the compan y went off to sup in neighbouring glade shall we describe the supper we think not it was beyond description delightful just it was finished the moon rose from behind cloud so the compan y knew that it w time to go home before going away they all assembled at the foot of the oak and shook claws with lady butterfly and mr grasshopper saying that they were charmed with the delightful ev ening they had spent and that they hoped to be soon in vited again in few minutes they were all gone the sounds of their laughing voices they returned home died gradually away and the shadows of night spread over
