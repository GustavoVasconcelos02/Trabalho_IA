then conversed with he went on with thousand incoherent circumstances which in his imagination must needs please but they had the quite contrary effect the ﬂattery with which he began in telling how well i wore was not disagreeable but his indiscreet mention of set of acquaintance we had outlived recalled ten thousand things to my memory which made reﬂect upon my present condition with regret had he indeed been so kind after long absence to felicitate upon an indolent and easy old age and mentioned how much he and i had to thank who at our time of day could walk ﬁrmly eat heartily and converse cheerfully he had kept up my pleasure in myself but of all mankind there are none so shocking these injudicious civil people they ordinarily begin upon something that they know must be satisfaction but then fear of the imputation of ﬂattery they follow it with the last thing in the world of which you would be reminded it is this that perplexes civil persons the reason that there is such general outcry among us against ﬂatterers is that there are so very few good ones it is the nicest art in this life and is part of eloquen ce which does not want the preparation that is necessary to all other parts of it that your audience should be your praise from an enemy is the most pleasing of all commendations it is generally to be observed that the person most agreeable to man constancy is he that has shining qualities but is certain degree above great imperfections whom he can live with his inferior and who will either overlook or not observe his little defects such an easy companion this either now and then throws out little ﬂattery or lets man silently ﬂatter himself in his superiority to him if you take notice there is hardly rich man in the world who has not such led friend of small consideration who is darling his insigniﬁcancy it is great ease to have one in our own shape species below us and who without being listed in our service is by nature of our retinue these

rich or those whom they call people at their ease are your persons of consequence i have known some of them by the help of little cunning make delicious ﬂatterers they know the course of the town and the general characters of persons by this means they will sometimes tell the most agreeable falsehoods imaginable they will acquaint you that such one of quite contrary party said that tho you were engaged in different interests yet he had the greatest respect your good sense and address when one of these has little cunning he passes his time in the utmost satisfaction to himself and his friends his position is never to report or speak displeasing thing to his friend letting him go on in an error he knows advice against them is the ofﬁce of persons of greater talents and less discretion the latin word ﬂatterer assentator implies more than person that barely consents and indeed such one if man were able to purchase or maintain him can not be bought too dear such one never contradicts you but gains upon you not by fulsome way of commending you in broad terms but liking whatever you propose or utter at the same time is ready to beg your pardon and gainsay you if you chance to speak ill of yourself an old lady is very seldom without such companion this who can recite the names of all her lovers and the matches refused by her in the days when she minded such she is pleased to call them tho she so much approves the mention of them it is to be noted that woman ﬂatterer is generally elder than herself her years serving to recommend her patroness age and to add weight to her complaisance in all other particulars we gentlemen of small fortunes are extremely necessitous in this particular i have indeed one who smokes with often but his parts are so low that all the incense he does is to ﬁll his pipe with and to be out at just many whiffs i take this is all the praise or assent that he is capable of yet there are more hours when i would rather be in his company than that of the brightest man i know it would be hard matter to give an account of this inclination to be ﬂattered but if we go to the bottom of it we shall ﬁnd that the pleasure in it is something like that of receiving money which lay out every man thinks he has an estate of reputation and is glad to see one that will bring any of it home to him it is matter how dirty bag it is conveyed to him in or by how clownish messenger so the money is good all that we want to be pleased with ﬂattery is to believe that the man is sincere who gives it us it is by this one accident that absurd creatures often outrun the most skilfu l in this art their want of ability is here an advantage and their bluntness it is the seeming effect of sincerity is the best cover to artiﬁce it is indeed the greatest of injuries to ﬂatter any but the unhappy or such are displeased with themselves some inﬁrmity in this latter case we have member of our club that when sir jeffrey falls asleep wakens him with snoring

were affected with them and whereas serious spirits might perhaps have been disgusted at the sight of some odd occurences in life yet the very same occurrences shall please them in told story where the disagreeable parts of the images are concealed and those only which are pleasing exhibited to the fancy is therefore not an art but what we call knack it doth not so much subsist upon wit upon humor and i will add that it is not perfect without proper gesticulations of the body which naturally attend such merry emotions of the mind i know very well that certain gravity of countenance sets some stories off to advantage where the hearer is to be surprized in the end but this is by means general rule it is frequently convenient to aid and assist by cheerful looks and whimsical agitations i will go yet further and afﬁrm that the success of story very often depends upon the make of the body and the formation of the features of him who relates it i have been of this opinion ever since i criticized upon the chin of dick dewlap i very often had the weakness to repine at the prosperity of his conceits which made him pass wit with the widow at the and the ordinary mechanics that frequent it nor could i myself forbear laughing at them most heartily tho upon examination i thought most of them very ﬂat and insipid i found after some time that the merit of his wit was founded upon the shaking of fat paunch and the tossing up of pair of rosy jowls poor dick had ﬁt of sickness which robbed him of his fat and his fame at once and it was full three months before he regained his reputation which rose in proportion to his ﬂoridity he is now very jolly and ingenious and hath good constitution wit those who are thus adorned with the gifts of nature are apt to show their parts with too much ostentation i would therefore advise all the professors of this art never to tell stories but they seem to grow out of the of the conversation or they serve to illustrate or enliven it stories that are very common are generally irksome but may be aptly introduced provided they be only hinted at and mentioned by way of allusion those that are altogether new should never be ushered in without short and pertinent character of the chief persons concerned because by that means you may make the company acquainted with them and it is certain rule that slight and trivial accounts of those who are familiar to us administer more mirth than the brightest points of wit in unknown characters little circumstance in the complexion of dress of the man you are talking of sets his image before the hearer if it be chosen aptly the story thus i remember tom lizard after having made his sisters merry with an account of formal old man way of complimenting owned very frankly that his story would not have been worth one farthing if he had made the hat of him whom he represented one inch narrowe besides the marking distinct characters and selecting pertinent circumstances it is likewise necessary to leave off in time and end smartly so that there is kind of drama in the forming of story and the manner of conducting and pointing it is the same in an epigram it is miserable thing after one hath raised the expectation of the company by humorous characters and pretty conceit to pursue the matter too far there is retreating and how poor is it to end his relation by saying that all iii sir roger and the widow 2 in my ﬁrst description of the company in which i pass most of my time it may be remembered that i mentioned great afﬂiction which my friend sir roger had met

land should be settled upon one who has used so ill the perverse widow did and yet i am sure i could not see sprig of any bough of this whol walk of trees but i should reﬂect upon her and her severity she has certainly the ﬁnest hand of any woman in the world you are to know this was the place wherein i used to muse upon her and by that custom i can never come into it but the same tender sentiments revive in my mind if i had actually walked with that beautiful creature under these shades i have been fool enough to carve her name on the bark of several of these trees so unhappy is the condition of men in love to attempt the removing of their passion by the methods which serve only to imprint it deeper she has certainly the ﬁnest hand of any woman in the world here followed profound silence and i was not displeased to observe my friend falling so naturally into discourse which i had ever before taken notice he industriously avoided after very long pause he entered upon an account of this great circumstance in his life with an air which i thought raised my idea of him above what i had ever had before and gave the picture of that cheerful mind of his before it received that stroke which has ever since af fected his words and actions but he went on follows i came to my estate in my year and resolved to follow the steps of the most worthy of my ancestors who have inhabited this spot of earth before in all the methods of hospitality and good neighb orhood the sake of my fame and in country sports and recreations the sake of my health in my year i was obliged to serve sherif f of the county and in my servants ofﬁcers and whole equipage indulged the pleasure of young man who did not think ill of his own person in taking that public occasion of showing my ﬁgure and behavior to advantage you may easily imagine to yourself what appearance i made who am pretty tall rode well and was very well drest at the head of whole county with music before feather in my hat and my horse well bitted i can assure you i was not little pleased with the kind looks and glances i had from all the balconies and windows i rode to the hall where the assizes were held but when i came there beautiful creature in widow habit sat in court to hear the event of cause concerning her dower this commanding creature who was born the destruction of all who behold her put on such resignation in her countenance and bore the whispers of all around the court with such pretty uneasiness i warrant you and then recovered herself from one eye to another until she was perfectly confused by meeting something so wistful in all she encountered that at last with murrain to her she cast her bewitching eye upon i sooner met it but i bowed like great surprized booby and knowing her cause was to be the ﬁrst which came on i cried like great captivated calf i was way the defendant witnesses this sudden partiality made all the county immediately see the sherif f also was become slave to the ﬁne widow during the time her cause was upon trial she behaved herself i warrant you with such deep attention to her business took opportunities to have little billets handed to her counsel then would be in such pretty confusion occasioned you must know by acting before so much company that not only i but the whole court was prejudiced in her favor and all that the next heir to her husband had to urge was thought so groundless and frivolous that when it came to her counsel to reply there was not half so much said every one besides in the court thought he could have ur ged to her advantage you must understand sir this perverse woman is one of those unaccountable creatures that secretly rejoice in the admiration of men but indulge themselves in further consequences hence it is that she has ever had train of admirers and she removes from her slaves in town to those in the country according to the seasons of the year she is reading lady and far gone in the pleasur es of friendship she is always accompanied by conﬁdant who is witness to her daily protestations against our sex and consequently bar to her ﬁrst steps toward love upon the strength of her own maxims and declarations 11 12

mine has distinguished above the rest and has been known to declare sir roger coverley was the tamest and most humane of all the brutes in the country i was told she said so by one who thought he rallied but upon the strength of this slender encouragement of being thought least detestable i made new liveries new paired my coach horses sent them all to town to be bitted and taught to throw their legs well and move all together before i pretended to cross the country and wait upon her soon i thought my retinue suitable to the character of my fortune and youth i set out from hence to make my addre sses the particular skill of this lady has ever been to inﬂame your wishes and yet command respect to make her mistress of this art she has greater share of knowledge wit and good sense than is usual even among men of merit then she is beautiful beyond the race of women if you will not let her go on with certain artiﬁce with her eyes and the skill of beauty she will arm herself with her real charms and strike you with admiration instead of desire it is certain that if you were to behold the whole woman there is that dignity in her aspect that composure in her motion that complacency in her manner that if her form makes you hope her merit makes you fear but then again she is such desperate scholar that country gentleman can approach her without being jest i was going to tell you when i came to her house i was admitted to her presence with great civility at the same time she placed herself to be ﬁrst seen by in such an attitude i think you call the posture of picture that she discovered new charms and i at last came toward her with such an awe made speechless this she sooner observed but she made her advantage of it and began discourse to concerning love and honor they both are followed by pretenders and the real votaries to them when she discust these points in discourse which i verily believe was learned the best philosopher in europe could possibly make she asked whether she was so happy to fall in with my sentiments on these important particulars her conﬁdant sat by her and upon my being in the last confusion and silence this malicious aid of hers turning to her says i am very glad to observe sir roger pauses upon this subject and seems resolved to deliver all his sentiments upon the matter when he pleases to speak they both kept their countenances and after i had sat half an hour meditating how to behave before such profound casuists i rose up and took my leave chance has since that time thrown very often in her way and she often directed discourse to which i not understand this barbarity has kept ever at distance from the most beautiful object my eyes ever beheld it is thus also she deals with all mankind and you must make love to her you would conquer the sphinx by posing her but were she like other women and that there were any talking to her how constant must the pleasure of that man be who could converse with after all you may be sure her heart is ﬁxt on some one or other and yet i have been credibly informed but who can believe half that is said after she had done speaking to she put her hand to her bosom and adjusted her tucker then she cast her eyes little down upon my beholding her too earnestly they say she sings excellently her voice in her ordinary speech has something in it inexpressibly sweet you must know i dined with her at public table the day after i ﬁrst saw her and she helped to some tansy in the eye of all the gentlemen in the country she has certainly the ﬁnest hand of any woman in the world i can assure you sir were you to behold her you would be in the same condition her speech is music her form is angelic but i ﬁnd i grow irregular while i am talking of her but indeed it would be stupidity to be unconcerned at such perfection oh the excellent creature she is inimitable to all women she is inaccessible to all men i found my friend begin to rave and insensibly led him toward the house that we might be joined by some other company and am convinced that the widow is the secret cause of all that inconsistency which appears in some parts of my friend discourse tho he has so much

dress and how the persons of one age differ from those of another merely by that only one may observe also that the general fashion of one age has been followed by one particular set of people in

in secret bounties many years after the sum he aimed at his own use was attained yet he did not slacken his industry but to decent old age spent the life and fortune which was superﬂuous to himself in

she could learn many things that were laudable but also because i looked upon her imitation of him an infallible sign that she entirely loved him this is an observation that i never knew fail tho i

there were several written papers our curiosity was immediately raised so that we went to the place where the sexton had been at work and found great concourse of people about the grave among the rest there was an old woman who told us the person buried there was lady whose name i not think ﬁt to mention tho there is nothing in the story but what tends very much to her honor this lady lived several years an exemplary pattern of conjugal love and dying soon after her husband who every way answered her character in virtue and affection made it her request that all the letters which she had received from him both before and after her marriage should be buried in the cofﬁn with her these i found upon examination were the papers before us several of them had suffered so much by time that i

one and less of the other than is commonly supposed our want of time and the shortness of human life are some of the principal commonplace complaints which we prefer against the established order of things they are the grumblings of the vulgar and the pathetic lamentations of the philosopher but they are impertinent and impious in both the man of business despises the man of pleasure squandering his time away the man of pleasure pities or laughs at the man of business the same thing and yet both concur superciliously and absurdly to ﬁnd fault with the supreme being having given them so little time the philosopher who misspends it very often much the others joins in the same cry and authorizes this impiety theophrastus thought it extremely hard to die at ninety and to go out of the world

otherwise is shocking presumption it is to presume that the syste m of the universe would have been more wisely contrived if creatures of our low rank among intellectual natures had been called to the councils of the most high or that the creator ought to mend his work by the advice of the creature that life which seems to our love so short when we compare it with the ideas we frame of eternity or even with the duration of some other beings will appear sufﬁcient upon less partial view to all the ends of the creation and of just proportion in the successive course of generations the term itself is long we render it short and the want we complain of ﬂows from our profusion not from our poverty let us leave the men of pleasure and of business who are often candid enough to own that they throw away their time and thereby to confess that they complain of the supreme being other reason than this that he has not proportioned his bounty to their extravagance let us consider the scholar and philosopher who far from owning that he throws any time away reproves others doing it that solemn mortal who abstains from the pleasures and declines the business of the world that he may dedicate his whole time to the search of truth and the improvement of knowledge when such one complains of the shortness of human life in general or of his remaining share in particular might not man more

imperfect and undetermined they were at ﬁrst but let ask you again and deceive neither yourself nor have you in the course of these forty years once examined the ﬁrst principles and the fundamental facts on which all those questions depend with an absolute indifference of judgment and with scrupulous exactness with the same care that you have employed in examining the various consequences drawn from them and the heterodox opinions about them have you not taken them granted in the whole course of your studies or if you have looked now and then on the state of the proofs brought to maintain

communicate my thoug hts to you and i practised in those days much business and pleasure allowed time to the rules that seemed to necessary to be observed in the study of history they were very different from those which writers on the same subject have recommended and which are commonly practised but i confess to your lordship that this neither gave then nor has given since any distrust of them i not affect singularity on the contrary i think that due deference is to be paid to received opinions and that due compliance with received customs is to be held tho both the one and the other

without any regard therefore to the opinion and practise even of the learned world i am very willing to tell you mine but it is hard to recover thread of thought long ago laid aside and impossible to prove some things and explain others without the assistance of many books which i have not here your lordship must be content with such an imperfect sketch i am able to send you in this letter the motives that carry men to the study of history are different some intend if such they may be said to study nothing more than amusement and read the life of aristides or phocion of epaminondas or scipio alexander or cæsar just they play game at cards or they would read the story of the seven champions others there are whose motive to this study is nothing better and who have the further disadvantage of becoming nuisance very often to society in proportion to the progress they make the former not improve their reading to any good purpose the latter pervert it to very bad one and grow in impertinence they increase in learnin i think i have known most of the ﬁrst kind in england and most of the last in france the persons i mean are those who read to talk to shine in conversation and to impose in company who having few ideas to vend of their own growth store their minds with crude unruminated facts and sentences and hope to supply by bare memory the want of imagination and judgment but these are in the two lowest forms the next i shall mention are in one little higher in the form of those who grow neither wiser nor better by study themselves but who enable others to study with greater ease and to purposes more useful who make fair copies of foul manuscripts give the signiﬁcation of hard words and take great deal of other grammatical pains the obligation to these men would be great indeed if they were in general able to anything better and submitted to this drudgery the sake of the public some of them it must be owned with gratitude have done but not later i think than about the time of the resurrection of letters when works of importance are pressing generals themselves may take up the pickax and the spade but in the ordinary course of things when that pressing necessity is over such tools are left in the hands destined to use them the hands of common soldiers and peasants i approve therefore very much the devotion of studious man at christ church

means god has given them to acquire it and littleton exerted all the genius he had when he made dictionary tho stephens did not they deserve encouragement however while they continue to compile and

chronology and history that we owe to the immense labors of scaliger bochart petav ius an usher and even marsham the same materials are common to them all but these materials are few and there is moral impossibility that they should ever have more they have combined these into every form that can be given to them they have supposed they have guessed they have joined disjointed passages of

make these my instructions more easily intelligible to ordinary readers if i discoursed of these matters in the style in which ladies learned in economics dictate to their pupils the improvement of

here endeavor the beneﬁt of my countrymen to make it manifest that epic poems may be made without genius nay without learning or much reading this must necessarily be of great use to all those poets who confess they never read and of whom the world is convinced they never learn what molière observes of making dinner that any man can it with money and if profest cook can not without he has his art nothing the same may be said of making is easily brought about by him that has genius but the skill lies in doing it without one in pursuance of this end i shall present the reader with plain and certain receipt by which even sonneteers and ladies may be qualiﬁed this grand performance i know it will be objected that one of the chief qualiﬁcations of an epic poet is to be knowing in all arts and sciences but this ought not to discourage those that have learning long indexes and dictionaries may be had which are the compe ndium of all knowledge besides since it is an established rule that none of the terms of those arts and sciences are to be made use of one may venture to afﬁrm our poet can not impertinently offend in this point the learning which will be more particularly necessary to him is the ancient geography of towns mountains and rivers this let him take culverius value fourpence another quality required is complete skill in languages to this i answer that it is notorious

them all may be comprised in that short latin proverb noscitur socio which i think is thus exprest in english you may know him by the company he keeps to say the truth some of that atrociou s wickedness in jones of which we have just mentioned three examples might perhaps be derived from the encouragement he had received from this fellow who in two or three instances had been what the law calls an accessory after the fact the whole duck and great part of the apples were converted to the use of the gamekeeper and his family tho jones alone was discovered the poor lad bore not only the whole smart but the whole blame both which fell again to his lot on the following occasion contiguous to allworthy estate was the manor of one of those gentlemen who are called preservers of the game this species of men from the great severity with which they revenge the death of hare or partridge might be thought to cultivate the same superstition with the bannians in india many of whom we are told dedicate their whole lives to the preservation and protection of certain animals was it not that our english bannians while they preserve them from other enemies will most unmercifully slaughter whole themselves so that they stand clearly acquitted of any such heathenish superstition i have indeed much better opinion of this kind of men than is entertained by some i take them to answer the order of nature and the good purposes which they were ordained in more ample manner than many others now horace tells us that there are set of human beings fruges consumer nati born to consume the fruits of the earth so i make manner of doubt but that there are others feras consumer nati born to consume the beasts of the ﬁeld or it is commonly called the game and none i believe will deny but that those squires fulﬁl this end of their creation little jones went one day with the gamekeeper when happening to spring covey of partridges near the border of that manor over which fortune to fulﬁl the wise purposes of nature had planted one of the the birds ﬂew into it and were marked it is called by the two sportsmen in some furze bushes about two or three hundred paces beyond mr allworthy dominions allworthy had given the fellow strict orders on pain of forfeiting his place never to trespass on any of his neighbors more on those who were less rigid in this matter than on the lord of the manor with regard to others indeed these orders had not been always very scrupulously kept but the disposition of the gentleman with whom the partridges had taken sanctuary was well known the gamekeeper had never yet attempted to invade his territories nor had he done it now had not the younger sportsman who was excessively eager to pursue the ﬂying game him but jones being very importunate the other who was himself keen enough after the sport yield ed to his persuasions entered the manor and shot one of the partridges 77 78 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x great britain and ireland ii by various https gentleman himself was at that time on horseback at little distance from them and hearing the gun go off he immediately made toward the place and discovered poor tom the gamekeeper had leapt into the thickest part of the where he had happily concealed himself the gentleman having searched the lad and found the partridge upon him denounced great vengeance swearing he would acquaint allworthy he was good his word he rode immediately to his house and complained of the trespass on his manor in high terms and bitter language if his house had been broken open and the most valuable furniture stolen out of it he added that some other person was in his company tho he could not discover him that two guns had been dischar ged almost in the same instant and says he we have found only this partridge but the lord knows what mischief they have done at his return home tom was presently convened before allworthy he owned the fact and alleged other excuse but what was really true that the covey was originally sprung in mr allworthy own manor tom was then interrogated who was with him which allworthy declared he was resolved to know acquainting the culprit with the circumstance of the two guns which had been deposed by the squire and both his servants but tom stoutly persisted in asserting that he was alone yet to say the truth he hesitated little at ﬁrst which would have conﬁrmed allworthy belief had what the squire and his servants said wanted any further conﬁrmation the gamekeeper being suspected person was now sent and the question put to him but he relying on the promise which tom had made him to take all upon himself very resolutely denied being in company with the young gentleman or indeed having seen him the whole afternoon allworthy then turned toward tom with more than usual anger in his countenance and advised him to confess who was with him repeating that he was resolved to know the lad however still maintained his resolution and was dismissed with much wrath by allworthy who told him he should have the next morning to consider of it when he should be questioned by another person and in another manner poor jones spent very melancholy night and the more so he was without his usual companion master bliﬁl was gone abroad on visit with his mother fear of the punishment he was to suffer was on this occasion his least evil his chief anxiety being lest his constancy should fail him and he should be brought to betray the gamekeeper whose ruin he knew must now be the consequence nor did the gamekeeper pass his time much better he had the same apprehensions with the youth whose honor he had likewise much tenderer regard than his skin in the morning when tom attended the reverend thwackum the person to whom allworthy had committed the instruction of the two boys he had the same questions put to him by that gentleman which he had been asked the evening before to which he returned the same answers the consequence of this was so severe whipping that it possibly fell little short of the torture with which confessions are in some countries extorted from criminals tom bore his punishment with great resolution and tho his master asked him between every stroke whether he would not confess he was contented to be ﬂayed rather than betray his friend or break the promise he had made the gamekeeper was now relieved from his anxiety and allworthy himself began to be concerned at tom sufferings besides that thwackum being highly enraged that he was not able to make the boy say what he himself pleased had carried his severity much beyond the good man intention this latter began now to suspect that the squire had been mistaken which his extreme eagerness and anger seemed to make probable 79 80 81 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x great britain and ireland ii by various https what the servants had said in conﬁrmation of their master account he laid great stress upon that now cruelty and injustice were two ideas of which allworthy could by means support the consciousness single moment he sent tom and after many kind and friendly exhortations said i am convinced my dear child that my suspicions have wronged you i am sorry that you have been so severely punished on this account and at last gave him little horse to make him amends again repeating his sorrow what had passed tom guilt now ﬂew in his face more than any severity could make it he could more easily bear the lashes of thwackum than the generosity of allworthy the tears burst from his eyes and he fell upon his knees crying oh sir you are too good to indeed you are indeed i deserve it and at that very instant from the fulness of his heart had almost betrayed the secret but the good genius of the gamekeeper suggested to him what might be the consequence to the poor fellow and this consideration sealed his lips thwackum did all he could to dissuade allworthy from showing any compassion or kindness to the boy saying he had persisted in untruth and gave some hints that second whipping might probably bring the matter to light but allworthy absolutely refused to consent to the experiment he said the boy had suffered enough already concealing the truth even if he was guilty seeing that he could have motive but mistaken point of honor so doing honor cried thwackum with some warmth mere stubbornness and obstinacy can honor teach any one to tell lie or can any honor exist independent of religion this discourse happened at table when dinner was just ended and there were present allworthy thwackum and third gentleman ii partridge sees garrick at the pla y 19 jones having spent three

entertainment in the criticisms of partrid ge from whom he expected the simple dictates of nature unimproved indeed but likewise unadulterated by art in the ﬁrst row then of the ﬁrst gallery did jones miller her youngest daughter and partridge take their places partridge immediately declared it was the ﬁnest place he had ever been in when the ﬁrst music was played he said it was wonde r how so many ﬁddlers could play at one time without putting one another out while the fellow was lighting the upper candles he cried out to miller look look madam the very picture of the man in the end of the common prayer book before the gunpowder service nor could he help observing with sigh when all the candles were lighted that here were candles enough burned in one night to keep an honest poor family whole twelvemonth soon the play which was hamlet prince of denmark began partridge was all attention nor did he break silence till the entrance of the ghost upon which he asked jones what man that was in the stran ge dress something said he like what i have seen in the picture sure it is not armor is it jones answered that is the ghost to 82 83 84 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the

partridge he was suffered to continue till the scene between the ghost and hamlet when partridge gave that credit to garrick which he had denied to jones and fell into so violent trembling that his knees knocked against each other jones asked him what was the matter and whether he was afraid of the warrior upon the stage la sir said he i perceive now it is what you told i am not afraid of anything i know it is but play and if it was really ghost it could one harm at such distance and in so much company and yet if i was frightened i am not the only person why who cries jones dost thou take to be such coward here besides thyself nay you may call coward if you will but if that little man there upon the stage is not frightened i never saw any man frightened in my life ay ay go along with you ay to be sure who fool then will you lud have mercy upon such foolhardiness whatever happens it is good enough you follow you i follow the devil soon nay perhaps it is the they say he can put on what likeness he pleases oh here he is again farther you have gone far enough already farther than i have gone all the king dominions jones offered to speak but partridge cried hush hush dear sir you hear him and during the whole speech of the ghost he sat with his eyes ﬁxt partly on the ghost and partly on hamlet and with his mouth open the same passions which succeeded each other in hamlet succeeding likewise in him when the scene was over jones said why partridge you exceed my expectations you enjoy the play more than i conceived possible nay sir answered partridge if you are not afraid of the devil i ca help it but to be sure it is natural to be surprized at such things tho i know there is nothing in them not that it was the ghost that surprized neither i should have known that to have been only man in strange dress but when i saw the little man so frightened himself it was that which took hold of and dost thou imagine then partridge cries jones that he was really frightened nay sir said partridge did not you yourself observe afterward when he found it was his own father spirit and how he was murdered in the garden how his fear forsook him by degrees and he was struck dumb with sorrow it were just i should have been had it been my own case but hush la what noise is that there he is again well to be certain tho i know there is nothing at all in it i am glad i am not down yonder where those men are then turning his eyes again upon hamlet ay you may draw your sword what signiﬁes sword against the power of the devil during the second act partridge made very few remarks he greatly admired the ﬁneness of the dresses nor could he help observ ing upon the king countenance well said he how people may be deceived by faces nulla ﬁdes fronti is i ﬁnd true saying who would think by looking in the king face that he had ever committed murder he then inquired after the ghost but jones who intended he should be surprized gave him other satisfaction than that he might possibly see him again soon and in ﬂash of ﬁre partridge sat in fearful expectation of this and now when the ghost made his next appearance partridge cried out there sir now what say you now is he frightened now or much frightened you think and to be sure nobody can help some fears i would not be in so bad condition what his name squire hamlet is there all the world bless what become of the spirit i am living soul i thought i saw him sink into the earth indeed you saw right answered jones well well cries partridge i know it is only play and besides if there was anything in all this madam miller would not laugh so to you sir you would not be afraid i believe if the devil was here in person there wonder you are in such passion shake the vile wicked wretch to pieces if she was my own mother i would serve her so to be sure all duty to mother is forfeited by such wicked y go about your business i hate the sight of you 85 86 87 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world

understand till jones explained it to him but he sooner entered into the spirit of it than he began to bless himself that he had never committed murder then turning to miller he asked her if she did

chair than he sits upon wonder he run away your sake i never trust an innocent face again the scene next engaged the attention of partridge who exprest much surprize at the number of skulls thrown upon the stage to which jones answered that it was one of the most famous buria about town wonder then cries partridge that the place is haunted but i never saw in my life worse i had sexton when i was clerk that should have dug three graves while he is digging one the fellow handles spade if it was the ﬁrst time he had ever had one in his hand ay ay you may sing you had rather sing than work i believe upon hamlet taking up the skull he cried out well it is strange to see how fearless some men are i never could bring myself to touch anything belonging to dead man on any account he seemed frightened enough too at the ghost i thought nemo omnibus horis little more worth remembering occurred during the play at the end of which jones asked him which of the players he had liked best to this he answered with some appearance of indignation at the question the king without doubt indeed partridge says miller you are not of the same opinion with the town they are all agreed that hamlet is acted by the best player who ever was on the stage he the best player cries partridge with contemptuous sneer why i could act well he himself i am sure if i had seen ghost i should have looked in the very same manner and done just he did and then to be sure in that scene you called it between him and his mother where you told he acted so ﬁne why lord help any man that is any good man that had

judgment that he had he wrote and profest to write merely the people and when he pleased others he contented himself he spent time in struggles to rouse latent powers he never attempted to make that better which was already good not often to mend what he must have known to be faulty he wrote he tells us with very little considerati on when occasion or necessity called upon him he poured out what the present moment happened to supply and when once it had passed the press ejected it from his mind when he had pecuniary interest he had further solicitude pope was not content to satisfy he desired to excel and therefore always endeavored to his best he did not court the candor but dared the judgment of his reader and expecting indulgence from others he showed none to himself he examined lines and words with minute and punctilious observation and retouched every part with indefatigable diligence till he had left nothing to be given this reason he kept his pieces very long in his hands while

criticism received many improvements after its ﬁrst appearance it will seldom be found that he altered without adding clearness elegance or vigor pope had perhaps the judgment of dryden but dryden

time study with better means of information his mind has larger range and he collects his images and illustrations from more extensive circumference of science dryd en knew more of man in his general nature and pope in his local manners the notions of dryden were formed by comprehensive speculation and those of pope by minute attention there is more dignity in the knowledge of dryden and more certainty in that of pope poetry was not the sole praise of either both excelled likewise in prose but pope did not borrow his prose from his predecessor the style of dryden is capricious and varied that of pope is cautious and uniform dryden obeys the motions of his own mind pope constrains his mind to his own rules of composition dryden is sometimes vehement and rapid pope is always smooth uniform and gentle dryden page is natural ﬁeld rising into inequalities and diversiﬁed by the varied exuberance of abundant vegetation pope is velvet lawn shaven by the scythe and leveled by the roller of genius that power which constitute s poet that quality without which judgment is cold and knowledge is inert that energy which collects combines ampl iﬁes and animates the superiority must with some hesitation be allowed to dryden it is not to be inferred that of this poetical vigor pope had only little because dryden had more every other writer since milton must give place to pope and even of dryden it must be said that if he has brighter paragraphs he has not better poems dryden performances were always hasty either excited by some external occasion or extorted by domestic

habitations of literature but without much satisfaction to the judicious inquirer some have imagined that the garret is generally chosen by the wits most easily rented and concluded that man rejoices in his aerial abode but on the days of payment others suspect that garret is chieﬂy convenient it is remoter than any other part of the house from the outer door which is often observed to be infested by visitants who talk incessantly of beer or linen or coat and repeat the same sounds every morning and sometimes again in the afternoon without any variation except that they grow daily more importunate and clamorous and raise their voices in time from mournful murmurs to raging vociferations this eternal monotony is always detestable to man whose chief pleasure is to enlar ge his knowledge and vary his ideas others talk of freedom from noise and abstraction from common business or amusements and some yet more visionary tell us that the faculties are enlar ged by open prospects

reserved to make illustrious by its discovery and you by its promulgation it is universally known that the faculties of the mind are invigorated or weaken ed by the state of the body and that the body is in great measure regulated by the various compressions of the ambient element the effects of the air in the production or cure of corporeal maladies have been acknowledged from the time of hippocrates but man has yet sufﬁciently considered how far it may inﬂuence the operations of the genius tho every day affords instances of local understanding of wits and reasoners whose faculties are adapted to some single spot and who when they are removed to any other place sink at once into silence and stupidity i have discovered by long series of observa tions that invention and elocution suffer great impediments from dense and impure vapors and that the tenuity of defecated air at proper distance from the surface of the earth accelerates the fancy and sets at liberty those

unanimous consent of posterity the unusual length of her administration and the strong features of her character were able to overcome all prejudices and obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives and her admirers somewhat of their panegyrics have at last in spite of political factions and what is more of religious animosities produced uniform judgment with regard to her conduct her

less rigorous less imperious more sincere more indulgent to her people would have been requisite to form perfect character by the force of her mind she controlled all her more active and stronger qualities and prevented them from running into excess her heroism was exempt from temerity her frugality from avarice her friendship from partiality her active temper from turbulency and vain ambition she guarded not herself with equal care or equal success from lesser inﬁrmities rivalship of beauty the desire of admiration the jealousy of love and the sallies of anger her singular talents

her vigor to make deep impressions on their states her own greatness meanwhile remained untouched and unimpaired the wise ministers and brave warriors who ﬂourished under her reign share the praise of her success but instead of lessening the applause due to her they make great addition to it they owed all of them their advancement to her choice they were supported by her constancy and with all their abilities they were never able to acquire any undue ascendant over her in her family in her court in her kingdom she remained equally mistress the force of the tender passions was great over her

ii the defea t of the armada 30 the lizard was the ﬁrst land made by the armada about sunset and the spaniards took it the ramhead near plymouth they bore out to sea with an intention of returning next day and attacking the english navy they were descried by fleming scottish pirate who was roving in those seas and who immediately set sail to inform the english admiral of their approach another fortunate event which contributed extremely to the safety of the ﬂeet efﬁngham 31 had just time to get out of port when he saw the spanish armada coming full sail towa rd him disposed in the form of crescent and stretching the distance of seven miles from the extremity of one division to that of the other the writers of that age raise their style by pompous description of this spectacle the most magniﬁcent that had ever appeared upon the ocean infusing equal terror and admiration into the minds of all beholders the lofty masts the swelling sails and the towering prows of the spanish galleons seem impossible to be justly painte d but by assuming the colors of poetry and an eloquent historian of italy in imitation of camden has asserted that the armada tho the ships bore every sail yet advanced with slow motion if the ocean groaned with supporting and the winds were tired with impelling so enormous weight the truth however is that the largest of the spanish vessels would scarcely pass third rates in the present navy of england yet were they so ill framed or so ill governed that they were quite unwieldy and could not sail upon wind nor tack on occasion nor be managed in stormy weather by the seamen neither the mechanics of shipbuilding nor the experience of mariners had attained so great perfection could serve the security and government of such bulky vessels and the english who had already had experience how unserviceable they commonly were beheld without dismay their tremendous appearance efﬁngham gave orders not to come to close ﬁght with the spaniards where the size of the ships he inspected and the numbers of the soldiers would be disadvantage to the english but to cannonade them at distance and to wait the opportunity which winds currents or various accidents must afford him of intercepting some scattered vessels of the enemy nor was it long before the event answered expectation great ship of biscay on board of which was considerable part of the spanish money took ﬁre by accident and while all hands were employed in extinguishing the ﬂames she fell behind the rest of the armada the great galleon of andalusia was detained by the springing of her mast and both these vessels were taken after some resistance by sir francis drake the armada advanced up the channel the english hung upon its rear and still infested it with skirmishes each trial abated the conﬁd ence of the spaniards and added courage to the english and the latter soon found that even in close ﬁght the size of the spanish ships was advantage to them their bulk exposed them the more to the ﬁre of the enemy while their cannon placed too high shot over the heads of the english the alarm having now reached the coast of england the nobility and gentry hastened out with their vessels from every harbor and reenforced the admiral the earls of oxford northumberland 113 114 115 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x great britain and ireland ii by various https cumberland sir thomas cecil sir robert cecil sir walter raleigh sir thomas vavasor sir thomas gerrard sir charles blount with many others distinguished themselves by this generous and disinterested service of their country the english ﬂeet after the conjunction of those ships amounted to hundred and forty sail the armada had now reached calais and cast anchor before that place in expectation that the duke of parma who had gotten intelligence of their approach would put to sea and join his forces to them the english admiral practised here successful stratagem upon the spaniards he took eight of his smaller ships and ﬁlling them with all combustible materials sent them one after another into the midst of the enemy the spaniards fancied that they were ﬁreships of the same contrivance with famous vessel which had lately done so much execution in the schelde near antwerp and they immediately cut their cables and took to ﬂight with the greatest disorder and precipitation the english fell upon them next morning while in confusion and besides doing great damage to other ships they took or destroyed about twelve of the enemy by this time it was become apparent that the intention which these preparat ions were made by the spaniards was entirely frustrated the vessels provided by the duke of parma were made transporting soldie rs not ﬁghting and that general when urged to leave the harbor positively refused to expose his ﬂourishing army to such apparent hazard while the english not only were able to keep the sea but seemed even to triumph over their enemy the spanish admiral found in many recounters that while he lost so considerable part of his own navy he had destroyed only one small vessel of the english and he foresaw that by continuing so unequal combat he must draw inevitable destruction on all the remainder he prepared therefore to return homeward but the wind was contrary to his passage through the channel he resolved to sail northward and making the tour of the island reach the spanish harbors by the ocean the english ﬂeet followed him during some time and had not their ammunition fallen short by the negligence of the ofﬁcers in supplying them they had obliged the whole armada to surrender at discretion the duke of medina 32 had once taken that resolution but was diverted from it by the advice of his confessor this conclusion of the enterprise would have been more glorious to the english but the event proved almost equally fatal to the spaniards violent tempest overtook the armada after it passed the orkneys the ships had already lost their anchors and were obliged to keep to sea the mariners unaccustomed to such hardships and not able to govern such unwieldy vessels yielded to the fury of the storm and allowed their ships to drive either on the wester n isles of scotland or on the coast of ireland where they were miserably wrecked not half of the navy returned to spain and the seamen well soldiers who remained were so overcome with hardships and fatigue and so dispirited by their discomﬁture that they ﬁlled all spain with accounts of the desperate valor of the english and of the tempestuous violence of that ocean which surrounds them iii the first principles of government nothing appears more surprizing to those who consider human affairs with philosophical eye than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few and the implicit submission with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of their rulers when we inquire by what means this wonder is effected we shall ﬁnd that force is always on the side of the governed the governors have nothing to support them but opinion it is therefore on opinion only that government is founded and this maxim extends to the most despotic and most military governments well to the most free and most popular the soldan of egypt or the emperor of rome might 116 117 118 the project gutenberg

but he must at least have led his mamelukes or prætorian bands like men by their opinions opinion is of two kinds to wit opinion of interest and opinion of right by opinion of interest i chieﬂy understand the sense of the general advantage which is reaped from government together with the persuasion that the particular government which is established is equally advantageous with any other that could easily be settled when this opinion prevails among the generality of state or among those who have the force in their hands it will give great security to any government right is of two kinds right to power and right to property what prevalence opinion of the ﬁrst kind has over mankind may easily be understood by observing the attachment which all nations have to their ancient government and even to those names which have had the sanction of antiquity antiquity always begets the opinion of right and whatever disadvantageous sentiments we may entertain of mankind they are always found to be prodigal both of blood and treasure in the maintenance of public justice there is indeed particular in which at ﬁrst sight there may appear greater contradiction in the frame of the human mind than the present when men act in faction they are apt without shame or remorse to neglect all the ties of honor and morality in order to serve their party and yet when faction is forme d upon point of right or principle there is occasion where men discover greater obstinacy and more determined sense of justice and equity the same social disposition of mankind is the cause of these contradictory appearances it is sufﬁciently understood that the opinion of right to property is of moment in all matters of government noted author has made property the foundatio n of all government and most of our politica l writers seem inclined to follow him in that particular this is carrying the matter too far but still it must be owned that the opinion of right to property has great inﬂuence in this subject upon these three opinions therefore of public interest of right to power and of right to property are all governments founded and all authority of the few over the many there are indeed other principles which add force to these and determine limit or alter their fear and affection but still we may assert that these other principles can have inﬂuence alone but suppose the antecedent inﬂuence of those opinions above mentioned they are therefore to be esteemed the secondary not the original principles of government ﬁrst to by which i mean the expectation of particular rewards distinct from the general protection which we receive from government it is evident that the magistrate authority must be antece dently established at least be hoped in order to produce this expectation the prosp ect of reward may augment his authority with regard to some particular persons but can never give birth to it with regard to the public men naturally look the greatest favors from their friends and acquaintance and therefore the hopes of any considerable number of the state would never center in any particular set of men if these men had other title to magistracy and had separate inﬂuence over the opinions of mankind the same observation may be extended to the other two principles of fear and affection man would have any reason to fear the fury of tyrant if he had authority over any but from fear since single man his bodily force can reach but small way and all the further power he possesses must be founded either on our own opinion or on the presumed opinion of others and tho affection to wisdom and virtue in sovereign extends very far and has great inﬂuence yet he must antecedently be supposed invested with public character otherwise the public esteem will serve him in stead nor will his virtue have any inﬂuence beyond narrow sphere government may endure several ages tho the balance of power and the balance of property not coincide this chieﬂy happens where any rank or order of the state has acquired large share in the property but from the original constitution of the 119 120 121 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x great britain and ireland ii by various https has share in the power under what pretense would any individual of that order assume authority in public affairs men are commonly much attached to their ancient government it is not to be expected that the public would ever favor such usurpations but where the original constitution allows any share of power tho small to an order of men who possess large share of the property it is easy them gradually to stretch their authority and bring the balance of power to coincide with that of property this has been the case with the house of commons in england most writers that have treated of the british government have supposed that the lower house represents all the comm ons of great britain its weight in the scale is proportioned to the property and power of all whom it represents but this princ iple must not be received absolutely true tho the people are apt to attach themselves more to the house of commons than to any other member of the constitution the house being chosen by them their representatives and the public guardians of their liberty yet are there instances where the house even when in opposition to the crown has not been followed by the people we may particularly observe of the tory house of commons in the reign of king william were the members obliged to receive instructions from their constituents like the dutch deputies this would entirely alter the case and if such immense power and riches those of all the commons of great britain were brought into the scale it is not easy to conceive that the crown could either inﬂuence that multitude of people or withstand that balance of property it is true the crown has great inﬂuence over the collective body in the elections of members but were this inﬂuence which at present is only exerted once in seven years to be employed in bringing over the people to every vote it would soon be wasted and skill popularity or revenue could support it i must therefore be of opinion that an alteration in this particular would introduce total alteration in our government and would soon reduce it to pure perhaps to republic of inconvenient form tho the people collected in body like the roman tribes be quite unﬁt government yet when dispersed in small bodies they are more susceptible both of reason and order the force of popular currents and tides is in great measure broken and the public interest may be pursued with some method and const ancy but it is needless to reason any further concerning form of government

chimneys and loves to haunt those stacks where there is constant doubt the sake of warmth not that it can subsist in the immediate shaft where there is ﬁre but prefers one adjoining to that of the kitchen and disregards the perpetual smoke of the funnel i have often observed with some degree of wonder five or six feet more down the chimney does this little bird begin to form her nest about the middle of may which consists like that of the of crust or shell composed of dirt or mud mixt with short pieces of straw to render it tough and permanent with this difference that whereas the shell of

rapacious birds and particularly from owls which frequently fall down chimneys perhaps in attempting to get at these nestlings the swallow lays from four to six white eggs dotted with red specks and brings out her ﬁrst brood about the last week in june or the ﬁrst week in july the progressive method by which the young are introduced into life is very amusing ﬁrst they emer ge from the shaft with

to him by the vote of the people themselves so too among the ancient germans the ancestors of our saxon forefathers they had their dukes well kings with an independent power over the military the kings had over the civil state the dukes were elective the kings hereditary so only can be consistently understood that passage of tacitus reges ex nobilitate duces ex virtute sumunt in constituting their kings the family or blood royal was regarded in choosing their dukes or leaders warlike merit just cæsar relates of their ancestors in his time that whenever they went to war by way either of

nothing is left to arbitrary discretion the king by his judges dispenses what the law has previously ordained but is not himself the legislator how much therefore is it to be regretted that set of men whose bravery has so often preserved the liberties of their country should be reduced to state of servitude in the midst of nation of free men sir edward coke 50 will inform us that it is one of the genuine marks of servitude to have the law which is our rule of action either concealed or precarious misera est servitus ubi jus est vagum aut incognitum nor is this the state of servitude quite consistent with the maxims of sound policy observed by other free nations the greater the general liberty is which any state enjoys the more cautious has it usually been in introducing slavery in any particular order or profession these men baron montesquieu observes seeing the liberty which others possess and which they themselves are excluded from are apt like eunuchs in the eastern seraglios to live in state of perpetual envy and hatred toward the rest of the community and indulge malignant pleasure in contributing to destroy those privileges to which they can never be admitted hence have many free states by departing from this rule been endangered by the revolt of their slaves while in absolute and despotic governments where real liberty exists and consequently invidious comparisons can be formed such incidents are extremely rare two precautions are therefore advised to be observed in all prudent and free governments to prevent the introduction of slavery at all or if it be already introduced not to entrust those slaves with arms who will then ﬁnd themselves an overmatch the freemen much less ought the soldiery to be an excepti on to the people in general footnotes from

in order to ﬁx its thread when it begins to weave it emits small drop of its liquid against the wall which hardening by degrees serves to hold the thread very ﬁrmly then receding from its ﬁrst point it recedes the thread lengthens and when the spider has come to the place where the other end of the thread should be ﬁxt gathering up with its claws the thread which would otherwise be too slack it is stretched tightly and ﬁxt in the same manner to the wall before in this manner it spins and ﬁxes several threads parallel to each other which so to speak serve the warp to the intended web to form the woof it spins in the same manner its thread transversely ﬁxing one end to the ﬁrst thread that was spun and which is always the strongest of the whole web and the other to the wall all these threads being newly spun are glutinous and therefore stick to each other wherever they happen to touch and in those parts of the web most exposed to be torn our natural artist strengthens them by doubling the threads sometimes sixfold thus far naturalists have gone in the description of this animal what follows is the result of my own observation upon that species of the insect called house spider i perceived about four years ago large spider in one corner of my room making its web and tho the maid frequently leveled her fatal broom against the labors of the little animal i had the 183 184 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x great britain and ireland ii by various https fortune then to prevent its destruction and i may say it more than paid by the entertainment it af forded in three days the web was with incredibl diligence completed nor could i avoid thinking that the insect seemed to exult in its new abode it frequently traversed it round examined the strength of every part of it retired into its hole and came out very frequently the ﬁrst enemy however it had to encounter was another and much larger spider which having web of its own and having probably exhausted all its stock in former labors of this kind came to invade the property of its neighbor soon then terrible encounter ensued in which the invader seemed to have the victory and the laborious spider was obliged to take refuge in its hole upon this i perceived the victor using every art to draw the enemy from his stronghold he seemed to go off but quickly returned and when he found all arts vain began to demolish the new web witho ut mercy this brought on another battle and contrary to my expectations the laborious spider became conqueror and fairly killed his antagonist now then in peaceable possession of what was justly its own it waited three days with the utmost impatience repairing the breaches of its web and taking sustenance that i could perceive at last however large blue ﬂy fell into the snare and struggled hard to get loose the spider gave it leave to entangle itself much possible but it seemed to be too strong the cobweb i must own i was greatly surprized when i saw the spider immediately sally out and in less than minute weave new net around its captive by which the motion of its wings was stopt and when it was fairly hampered in this manner it was seized and dragged into the hole in this manner it lived in precarious state and nature seemed to have ﬁtted it such life upon single ﬂy it subsisted more than week i once put wasp into the net but when the spider came out in order to seize it usual upon perceiving what kind of an enemy it had to deal with it instantly broke all the bands that held it fast and contributed all that lay in its power to disengage so formidable an antagonist when the wasp was at liberty i expected the spider would have set about repairing the breaches that were made in its net but those it seems were irreparable wherefore the cobweb was now entirely forsaken and new one begun which was completed in the usual time i had now mind to try how many cobwebs single spider could furnish wherefore i destroyed this and the insect set about another when i destroyed the other also its whole stock seemed entirely exhausted and it could spin more the arts it made use of to support itself now deprived of its great means of subsistence were indeed surprizing i have seen it roll up its legs like ball and lie motionless hours together but cautiously watching all the time when ﬂy happ ened to approach sufﬁciently near it would dart out all at once and often seize its prey of this life however it soon began to grow weary and resolved to invade the possession of some other spider since it could not make web of its own it formed an attack upon neighbor ing fortiﬁcation with great vigor and at ﬁrst was vigorously repulsed not daunted however with one defeat in this manner it continued to lay siege to another web three days and at length having killed the defendant actually took possession when smaller ﬂies happen to fall into the snare the spider does not sally out at once but very patiently waits till it is sure of them upon his immediately approaching the terror of his appearance might give the captive strength sufﬁcient to get loose the manner then is to wait patiently till by ineffectu al and impotent struggles the captive has wasted all its strength and then it becomes certain and easy conquest the insect i am now describing lived three years every year it changed its skin and got new set of legs i have sometimes plucked off leg which grew again in two or three days at ﬁrst it dreaded my approach to its web but at last it became so familiar to take ﬂy out of my hand and upon my touching any part of the web would immediately leave its hole prepared either defense or an attack 185 186 187 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x great britain and ireland ii by various https complete this description it may be observed that the male spiders are much less than the female and that the latter are ovipar ous when they come to lay they spread part of their web under the eggs and then roll them up carefully we roll up things in cloth and thus hatch them in their hole if disturbed in their holes they never attempt to escape without carrying this young brood in their forceps away with them and thus frequently are sacriﬁced to their paternal af fection soon ever the young ones leave their artiﬁcial covering they begin to spin and almost sensibly seem to grow bigger if they have the good fortune when even but day old to catch ﬂy they fall to with good appetites but they live sometimes three or four days without any sort of sustenance and yet still continue to grow larger so every day to double their former size they grow old however they not still continue to increase but their legs only continue to grow longer and when spider becomes entirely stiff with age and unable to seize its prey it dies at length of hunger iii chinaman view of london 53 think not thou guide of

reasonings and less in our pleasures but notwithstanding this difference which i think to be rather apparent than real it is probable that the standard both of reason and taste is the same in all human creatu res if there were not some principles of judgment well of sentiment common to all mankind hold could possibly be taken either on their reason or their passions sufﬁcient to maintain the ordinary correspondence of life it appears indee d to be generally acknowledged that with regard to truth and falsehood there is something ﬁxt we ﬁnd people in their disputes continually appealing to certain tests and standards which are allowed on all sides and are supposed to be established in our common nature but there is not the same obvious concurrence in any uniform or settled princip les which relate to taste it is even commonly supposed that this delicate and aerial faculty which seems too volatile to endure even the chains of deﬁnition can not be properly tried by any test nor regulated by any standard there is so continual call the exercise of the reasoning faculty and it is so much strengthened by perpetual contention that certain maxims of right reason seem to be tacitly settled amongst the most ignorant the learned have improved on this rude science and reduced those maxims into system if taste has not been so happily cultivated it was not that the subject was barren but that the laborers 51 52 53 194 195 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x great britain and ireland ii by various https few or negligent to say the truth there are not the same interesting motives to impel us to ﬁx the one which ur ge us to ascertain the other and after all if men differ in their opinion concerning such matters their difference is not attended with the same important consequences else i make doubt but that the logic of taste if i may be allowed the expression might very possibly be well digested and we might come to discuss matters of this nature with much certainty those which seem more immediately within the province of mere reason and indeed it is very necessary at the entrance into such an inquiry our present to make this point clear possible if taste has ﬁxt principles if the imagination is not affected according to some invariable and certain laws our labor is like to be employed to very little purpose it must be judged useless if not an absurd undertaking to lay down rules caprice and to set up legislator of whims and fancies the term taste like all other ﬁgurative terms is not extremely accurate the thing which we understand by it is far from simple and determinate idea in the minds of most men and it is therefore liable to uncertainty and confusion i have great opinion of deﬁnition the celebrated remedy the cure of this disorder when we deﬁne we seem in danger of circumscribing nature within the bounds of our own notions which we often take up by hazard or embrace on trust or form out of limited and partial consideration of the object before us instead of extending our ideas to take in all that nature comprehends according to her manner of combining we are limite d in our inquiry by the strict laws to which we have submitted at our setting out cir ca vilem patulumque morabimur orbem unde pudor pr oferr pedem vetet aut operis lex deﬁnition may be very exact and yet go but very little way toward informing us of the nature of the thing deﬁned but let the virtue of deﬁnition be what it will in the order of things it seems rather to follow than to precede our inquiry of which it ought to be considered the result it must be acknowledged that the methods of disqui sition and teaching may be sometimes different and on very good reason undoubtedly but my part i am convinced that the method of teaching which approaches most nearly to the method of investigation is incomparably the best since not content with serving up few barren and lifeless truths it leads to the stock on which they grew it tends to set the reader himself in the track of invention and to direct him into those paths in which the author has made his own discoveries if he should be so happy to have made any that are valuable but to cut off all pretense caviling i mean by the word taste more than that faculty or those faculties of the mind which are affected with or which form judgment of the works of imagination and the elegant arts this is i think the most general idea of that word and what is the least connected with any particular theory and my point in this inquiry is to ﬁnd whether there are any principles on which the imagination is affected so common to all so grounded and certain to supply the means of reasoning satisfactorily about them and such principles of taste i fancy there are however paradoxical it may seem to those who on superﬁcial view imagine that there is so great diversity of tastes both in kind and degree that nothing can be more determinate all the natural powers in man which i know that are conversant about extern al objects are the senses the imagination and the judgment and ﬁrst with regard to the senses we and we must suppose that the conformation of their organs are nearly or altogether the same in all men so the manner of perceiving external objects is in all men the same or with little difference we are satisﬁed that what appears to be light to one eye appears light to another that what seems sweet to one palate is sweet to another that what is dark and bitter to this man is likewise dark and bitter to that and we conclude in the same manner of great and little hard and soft hot and cold rough and smooth and indeed of all the natural qualities and affections of bodies if we suffer ourselves to imagine that their senses present to different men different images of things this skeptical proceeding 196 197 198 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x great britain and ireland ii by various https make every sort of reasoning on every subject vain and frivolous even that skeptical reasoning itself which had persuaded us to entertain doubt concerning the agreement of our perceptions but there will be little doubt that bodies present similar images to the whole species it must necessarily be allowed that the pleasures and the pains which every object excites in one man it must raise in all mankind whilst it operates naturally simply and by its proper powers only if we deny this we must imagine that the same cause operating in the same manner and on subjects of the same kind will produce different effects which would be highly absurd let us ﬁrst consider this point in the sense of taste and the rather the faculty in question has taken its name from that sense all men are agreed to call vinegar sour honey sweet and aloes bitter and they are all agreed in ﬁnding these qualities in those objects they not in the least differ concerning their effects with regard to pleasure and pain they all concur in calling sweetness pleasant and sourness and bitterness unpleasant here there is diversity in their sentiments and that there is not appears fully from the consent of all men in the metaphors which are taken from the sense of taste sour temper bitter expressions bitter curses bitter fate are terms well and strongly understood by all and we are altogether well understood when we say sweet disposition sweet person sweet condition and the like it is confest that custom and some other causes have made many deviations from the natural pleasures or pains which belong to these several tastes but then the power of distinguishing between the natural and the acquired relish remains to the very last man frequently comes to prefer the taste of tobacco to that of sugar and the ﬂavor of vinegar to that of milk but this makes confusion in tastes whilst he is sensible that the tobacco and vinegar are not sweet and whilst he knows that habit alone has reconciled his palate to these alien pleasures even with such person we may speak and with sufﬁcient precision concerning tastes but should any man be found who declares that to him tobacco has taste like sugar and that he can not distinguish between milk and vinegar or that tobacco and vinegar are sweet milk bitter and sugar sour we immediately conclude that the organs of this man are out of order and that his palate is utterly vitiated we are far from conferring with such person upon tastes from reason ing concerning the relations of quantity with one who should deny that all the parts together were equal to the whole we not call man of this kind wrong in his notions but absolutely mad exceptions of this sort in either way not at all impeach our general rule nor make us conclude that men have various principles concerning the relations of quantity or the taste of things so that when it is said taste can not be disputed it can only mean that one can strictly answer what pleasure or pain some particular man may ﬁnd from the taste of some particular thing this indeed can not be disputed but we may dispute and with sufﬁcient clearness too concerning the things which are naturall y pleasing or disagreeable to the sense but when we talk of any peculiar or acquired relish then we must know the habits the prejudices or the distempers of this particular man and we must draw our conclusion from those this agreement of mankind is not conﬁned to the taste solely the principle of pleasure derived from sight is the same in all light is more pleasing than darkness summer when the earth is clad in green when the heavens are serene and bright is more agreeable than winter when everything makes different appearance i never remember that anything beautiful whether man beast bird or plant was ever shown tho it were to hundred people that they did not all immediately agree that it was beautiful tho some might have thought that it fell short of their expectation or that other things were still ﬁner i believe man think s goose to be more beautiful than swan or imagines that what they call friesland hen excels peacock it must be observed too that the pleasures of the sight are not nearly so complicated and confused and altered by unnatural habits and associations the pleasures of the taste are because the pleasures of the sight more commonly acquiesce in themselves and are not so often altered by conditions which are independent of the sight itself 199 200 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x great britain and ireland ii by various https things not spontaneously presen t them selves to the palate they to the sight they are generally applied to it either food or medicine and from the qualities which they possess nutritive or medicinal purposes they often form the palate by degrees and by force of these associations thus opium is pleasing to turks on account of the agreeable delirium it produces tobacco is the delight of dutchmen it diffuses torpor and pleasing stupefaction fermented spirits please our common people because they banish care and all consideration of future or present evils all of these would lie absolutely neglected if their properties had originally gone further than the taste but all these together with tea and coffee and some other things have passed from the apothecary shop to our tables and were taken health long before they were thought of pleasure the effect of the drug has made us use it frequently and frequent use combined with the agreeable effect has made the taste itself at last agreeable but this does not in the least perplex our reasoning because we distinguish to the last the acquired from the natural relish in describing the taste of an unknown fruit you would scarcely say that it had sweet and pleasant ﬂavor like tobacco opium or garlic altho you spoke to those who were in the constant use of these drugs and had great pleasure in them there is in all men sufﬁcient remembrance of the original natural causes of pleasure to enable them to bring all things offered to their senses to that standard and to regulate their feelings and opinions by it suppose one who had so vitiated his palate to take more pleasure in the taste of opium than in that of butter or honey to be presented with bolus of squills there is hardly any doubt but that he would prefer the butter or honey to this nauseous morsel or to any other bitter drug to which he had not been accustomed which proves that his palate was naturally like that of other men in all things that it is still like the palate of other men in many things and only vitiated in some particular points in judging of any new thing even of taste similar to that which he has been formed by habit to like he ﬁnds his palate affected in the natural manner and on the common principles thus the pleasure of all senses of the sight and even of the taste that most ambiguous of the senses is the same in all high and low learned and unlearned besides the ideas with their annexed pains and pleasures which are presented by the sense the mind of man possesses sort of creative power of its own either in representing at pleasure the images of things in the order and manner in which they were received by the senses or in combining those images in new manner and according to different order this power is called imagination and to this belongs whatever is called wit fancy invention and the like but it must be observed that the power of the imagination is incapable of producing anything absolutely new it can only vary the disposition of those ideas which it has received from the senses now the imagination is the most extensive province of pleasure and pain it is the region of our fears and our hopes and of all our passions that are connected with them and whatever is calculated to affect the imagination with these comm anding ideas by force of any original natural impression must have the same power pretty equally over all men since the imagination is only the representation of the senses it can only be pleased or displeased with the images from the same principle on which the sense is pleased or disple ased with the realities and consequently there must be just close an agreement in the imaginations in the senses of men little attention will convince us that this must of necessity be the case but in the imaginations besides the pain or pleasure arising from the properties of the natural object pleasure is perceived from the resemblance which the imitation has to the original the imagination i conceive can have pleasure but what results from one or other of these causes and these cause s operate pretty uniformly upon all men because they operate by principles in nature and which are not derived from any particular habits or advantages locke very justly and ﬁnely observes of wit that it is chieﬂy conversant in tracing resemblances he remarks at the same time that the business of judgment is rather in ﬁnding differences it may perhaps appear on this supposition that there is material distinction between the wit and the judgment they both seem to result from dif ferent operations of the same faculty of comparing 201 202 203 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x great britain and ireland ii by various https in reality whether they are or are not dependent on the same power of the mind they differ so very materially in many respects that perfect union of wit and judgment is one of the rarest things in the world when two distinct objects are unlike to each other it is only what we expect things are in their common way and therefore they make impression on the imagination but when two distinct objects have resemblance we are struck we attend to them and we are pleased the mind of man has naturally far greater alacrity and satisfaction in tracing resemblances than in searching differences because by making resemblances we produce new images we unite we create we enlar ge our stock but in making distinctions we offer food at all to the imagination the task itself is more severe and irksome and what pleasure we derive from it is something of negative and indirect nature piece of news is told in the morning this merely piece of news fact added to my stock gives some pleasure in the evening i ﬁnd there was nothing in it what i gain by this but the dissatisfaction to ﬁnd that i had been imposed upon hence it is that men are much more naturally inclined to belief than to incredulity and it is upon this principle that the most ignorant and barbarous nations have frequently excelled in similitudes comparisons metaphors and allegories who have been weak and backward in distinguishing and sorting their ideas and it is reason of this kind that homer and the oriental writers tho very fond of similitudes and tho they often strike out such are truly admirable seldom take care to have them exact that is they are taken with the general resemblance they paint it strongly and they take notice of the difference which may be found between the things compared now the pleasure of resemblance is that which principally ﬂatters the imagination all men are nearly equal in this point far their knowledge of the things represented or compared extends the principle of this knowledge is very much accidental it depends upon experience and observation and not on the strength or weakness of any natural faculty and it is from this difference in knowledge that what we commonly tho with great exactness call difference in taste proceeds man to whom sculpture is new sees barber block or some ordinary piece of statuary he is immediately struck and pleased because he sees something like human ﬁgure and entirely taken up with this likeness he does not at all attend to its defects person i believe at the ﬁrst time of seeing piece of imitation ever did some time after we suppose that this novice lights upon more artiﬁcial work of the same nature he now begins to look with contempt on what he admired at ﬁrst not that he admired it even then its unlikeness to man but that general tho inaccurate resembla nce which it bore to the human ﬁgure what he admired at different times in these so different ﬁgures is strictly the same and tho his knowledge is improved his taste is not altered hitherto his mistake was from want of knowledge in art and this arose from his inexperience but he may be still deﬁc ient from want of knowledge in nature it is possible that the man in question may stop here and that the masterpiece of great hand may please him more than the middling performance of vulgar artist and this not want of better or higher relish but because all men not observe with sufﬁcient accuracy on the human ﬁgure to enable them to judge properly of an imitation of it and that the critical taste does not depend upon superior principle in men but upon superior knowledge may appear from several instances the story of the ancient painter and the shoemaker is very well known the shoemaker set the painter right with regard to some mistakes he had made in the shoe of one of his ﬁgures and which the painter who had not made such accurate observations on shoes and was content with general resemblance had never observed but this was impeachment to the taste of the painter it only showed some want of knowledge in the art of making shoes let us imagine that an anatomist had come into the painter his piece is in general well done the ﬁgure in question in good attitude and the parts well adjusted to their various movements yet the anatomist critical in his art may observe the swell of some muscle not quite just in the peculiar action of the ﬁgure here the anatomist observes what the painter had not observed and he passes by what the shoem aker had remarked 204 205 206

johnson biography which i thank you with one exception and that swinging one i think he has acquitted himself with his usual good sense and sufﬁciency his treatment of milton is unmerciful to the last degree pensioner is not likely to spare republican and the doctor in order i suppose to convince his royal patron of the sincerity of his monarchical principles has belabored that great poet character with the most industrious cruelty man he has hardly left him the shadow of one good quality churlishness in his private life and rancorous hatred of everything royal in his public are the two colors with which he has smeared all the canvas if he had any virtues they are not to be found in the doctor picture of him and it is well milton that some sourness in his temper is the only vice with which his memory has been charged it is evident enough that if his biographer could have discovered more he would not have spared him poet he has treated him with severity enough and has plucked one or two of the most beautiful feathers out of his muse wing and trampled them under his great foot he has passed sentence of condemnation upon lycidas and has taken occasion from that 218 219 220 the project

music of the paradise lost it is like that of ﬁne organ has the fullest and the deepest tones of majesty with all the softness and elegance of the dorian ﬂute variety without end and never equaled

publis hed in one volume octavo price three shillings poems 61 by william cowper of the inner temple esq you may suppose by the size of the publication that the greatest part of them have never been long kept secret because you yourself have never seen them but the truth is that they are most of them except what you have in your possession the produce of the last winter of the compilation will be occupied by four pieces the ﬁrst of which sprung up in the month of december and the last of them in the month of march they contain i suppose in all about two thousand and ﬁve hundred lines are known or are to be known in due time by the names of alk the progress of error truth expostulation newton writes preface and johnson is the publisher the principal i may say the only reason why i never mentioned to you till now an affair which i am just going to make known to all the world if that should think it worth his knowing has been that till within these few days i had not the honor to know it myself this may seem strange but it is true not knowing where to ﬁnd underwriters who would choose to insure them and not ﬁnding it convenient to purse like mine to run any hazard even upon the credit of my own ingenuity i was very much in doubt some weeks whether any bookseller would be willing to subject himself to an ambiguity that might prove very expensive in case of bad market but johnson has heroically set all peradventures at deﬁance and takes the whole charge upon himself so out i come i shall be glad of my translations from vincent bourne in your next frank my muse will lay herself at your feet immediately on her ﬁrst public appearance if 62 writer friends have need of patience how much more the writer your desire to see my muse in public and mine to gratify you must both suffer the mortiﬁ cation of delay i expected that my trumpeter would have informed the world by this time of all that is needful them to know upon such an occasion and that an advertising blast blown through every newspaper would have said the poet is coming but man especially man that writes verse is born to disappointments surely printers and booksellers are born to be the most dilatory and tedious of all creatures the plain english of this magniﬁcent preamble is that the season of publication is just elapsed that the town is going into the country every day and that my book can not appear till they is to say not till next winter this misfortune however comes not without its attendant advantage i shall now have what i should not otherwise have had an opportunity to correct the press myself small advantage upon any occasion but especially important where poetry is concerned single erratum may knock out the brains of whole passage and that perhaps which of all others the unfortunate poet is the most proud of add to this that now and then there is to be found in 221 222 223 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x

and tinkering and patching on here and there shred of his own he makes such difference between the original and the copy that an autho r can not know his own work again now i choose to be responsible nobody dulness but my own i am little comforted when i reﬂect that it will be in my power to prevent all such impertinence and yet not without your assistance it will be quite necessary that the correspondence between and johnson should be carried on without the expense of postage because ets would make double or treble letters which expense in every instance it must occur twice ﬁrst when the packet is sent and again when it is returned would be rather inconvenient to who you perceive am forced to live by my wits and to him who hopes to get little matter doubt by the same means half dozen franks therefore to and totidem to him will be singularly acceptable if you can without feeling it in any respect trouble procure them bookseller paul churchyard the writing of so long poem 63 is serious business and the author must know little of his own heart who does not in some degree suspect himself of partiality to his own production and who is he that would not be mortiﬁed by the discovery that he had written ﬁve thousand lines in vain the poem however which you have in hand will not of itself make volume so large the last or bookseller would wish i say this because when i had sent johnson ﬁve thousand verses he applied thousa nd more two years since i began piece which grew to the length of two hundred and there stopt i have lately resumed it and i believe shall ﬁnish it but the subject is fruitful and will not be comprized in smaller compass than seven or eight hundred verses it turns on the question whether an education at school or at home be preferable and i shall give the preference to the latter i mean that it shall pursue the track of the is to say it shall visit stock in its way to publication my design also is to inscribe it to you but you must see it ﬁrst and if after having seen it you should have any objection tho it should be bigger than the tittle of an i i will deny myself that pleasure and ﬁnd fault with your refusal i have not been without thoughts of adding john gilpin at the tail of all he has made good deal of noise in the world and perhaps it may not be amiss to show that tho i write generally with serious intention i know how to be occasionally merry the critical reviewers charged with an attempt at humor john having been more celebrated upon the score of humor than most pieces that have appeared in modern days may serve to exonerate from the imputation but in this article i am entirely under your judgment and mean to be set down by it all these together will make an octavo like the last i should have told you that the piece which now employs is rime i not intend to write any more blank it is more difﬁcult than rime and not so amusing in the composition if when you make the offer of my book to johnson he should stroke his chin and look up to the ceiling and cry humph anticipate him i beseech you at once by that you know i should be sorry that he should undertake to his own disadvantage or that my volume should be in any degree prest upon him i make him the offer merely because i think he would have reason to complain of if i did not but that punctilio once satisﬁed it is matter of indifference to

mademoiselle curchod were the theme of universal applause the report of such prodigy awakened my curiosity i saw and loved i found her learned without pedantry lively in conversation pure in sentiment and elegant in manners and the ﬁrst sudden emotion was fortiﬁed by the habits and knowledge of more familiar acquaintance she permitted to make her two or three visits at her father house i passed some happy days there in the mountains of burgundy and her parents honorably encouraged the connection in calm retirement the gay vanity of youth longer ﬂuttered in her bosom she listened to the voice

temple of jupiter that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city ﬁrst started to my mind but my original plan was circumscribed to the decay of the city rather than of the empire and tho my reading and reﬂections began to point toward that object some years elapsed and several avocations intervened before i was seriously engaged in the execution of that laborious work i have presumed to mark the moment of conception i shall now commemorate the hour of my ﬁnal deliverance it was on the day or rather night of the 27th of june 1787 between the hours of eleven and twelve that i wrote the last lines of the last page in summer in my garden after layin g down my pen i took several turns in berceau or covered walk of acacias which commands prospect of the country the lake and the mountains the air was temperate the sky was serene the silver orb of the moon was reﬂected from the waters and all nature was silent i will not dissemble the ﬁrst emotions of joy on recovery of my freedom and perhaps the establishment of my fame but my pride was soon humbled and sober melancholy was spread over my mind by the idea that i had taken an everlasting leave of an old and agreeable companion and that whatsoever might be the future date of my history the life of the historian must be short and precarious i will add two facts which have seldom occurred in the composition of six or

produced several illustrious women who have sustained with glory the weight of empire nor is our own age destitute of such distinguished characters but if we except the doubtful achievements of semiramis zenobia is perhaps the only female whose superior genius broke through the servile indolence imposed on her sex by the climate and manners of asia she claimed her descent from the macedonian kings of egypt equaled in beauty her ancestor cleopatra and far surpassed that princess in chastity and valor zenobia was esteemed the most lovely well the most heroic of her sex she was of dark complexion in speaking of lady these triﬂes become important her teeth were of pearly whiteness and her large black eyes sparkled with uncommon ﬁre tempered by the most attractive sweetness her voice was strong and harmon ious her manly understanding was strengthened and adorned by study she was not ignor ant of the latin tongue but possest in equal perfection the greek the syriac and the egyptian languages she had drawn up her own use an epitome of oriental history and familiarly compared the beauties of homer and plato under the tuition of the sublime longinus this accomplished woman gave her hand to odenathus who from private station raised himself to the dominion of the east she soon became the friend and companion of hero in the intervals of war oden athus passionately delighted in the exercise of hunting he pursued with ardor the wild beasts of the panthers and bears and the ardor of zenobia in that danger ous amusement was not inferior to his own she had inured her constitution to fatigue disdained the use of covered carriage generally appeared on horseback in military habit and sometimes marched several miles on foot at the head of the troops the success of odenathus was in great measure ascribed to her incomparable prudence and fortitude their splendid victories over the great king whom they twice pursued far the gates of ctesiphon 69 laid the foundations of their united fame and power the armies which they commanded and the provinc es which they had saved acknowledged not any other sovereigns than their invincible chiefs the senate and people of rome revered stranger who had avenged their captive emperor and even the insensible son of valerian accepted odenathus his legitimate colleague when aurelian passed over into asia against an adversary whose sex alone could render her an object of contempt his presence restored obedience to the province of bithynia already shaken by the arms and intrigues of zenobia advancing at the head of his legions he accepted the submission of ancyra and was admitted into tyana after an obstinate siege by the help of perﬁdious citizen the generous tho ﬁerce temper of aurelian abandoned the traitor to the rage of the soldiers superstitious reverence induced him to treat with lenity the countrymen of apollonius the philosopher antioch was deserted on his approach till the emperor by his salutary edicts recalled the fugitives and granted general pardon to all who from necessity rather than choice had been engaged in the service of the palm yrenian queen the unexpected mildness of such conduct reconciled the minds of the syrians and far the gates of emesa the wishes of the people seconded the terror of his arms zenobia would have ill deserved her reputation had she indolently perm itted the emperor of the west to approach within hundred miles of her capital the fate of the east was decided in two great battles so similar in almost every circumstance that we can scarcely distinguish them from each other except by observing that the ﬁrst was fought near antioch and the second near emesa in both the queen of palmyra animated the 231 232 233 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics

sustain the ponderous charge of their antagonists they ﬂed in real or affected disorder engaged the palmyrenians in laborious pursuit harassed them by desultory combat and at length discomﬁted this impenetrable but unwieldy body of cavalry the light infantry in the mean time when they had exhausted their quivers remaining without protection against closer onset exposed their naked sides to the swords of the legions aurelian had chosen these veteran troops who were usually stationed on the upper danube and whose valor had been severely tried in the alemannic war after the defeat of emesa zenobia found it impossible to collect third army far the frontier of egypt the nations subject to her empire had joined the standard of the conqueror who detached probus the bravest of his generals to possess himself of the egyptian provinces palmyra was the last resource of the widow of odenathus she retired within the walls of her capital made every preparation vigorous resistance and declared with the intrepidity of heroine that the last moment of her reign and of her life should be the same amid the barren deserts of arabia few cultivated spots rise like islands out of the sandy ocean

little republic sunk into the bosom of rome and ﬂourished more than one hundred and ﬁfty years in the subordinate tho honorable rank of colony it was during that peaceful period if we may judge from few remaining inscriptions that the wealthy palmyrenians construc ted those temples palaces and porticoes of grecian architecture whose ruins scattered over an extent of several miles have deserved the curiosity of our travelers the elevation of odenathus and zenobia appeared to reﬂect new splendor on their country and palmyra while stood forth the rival of rome but the competition was fatal and ages of prosperity were sacriﬁced to moment of glory the ﬁrmness of zenobia was supported by the hope that in very short time famine would compel the roman army to repass the desert and by the reasonable expectation that the kings of the east and particular ly the persian monarch would arm in the defense of their most natural ally but fortune and the perseverance of aurelian overcame every obstacle the death of sapor which happened about this time distracted the counsels of persia and the inconsiderable succors that attempted to relieve palmyra were easily intercepted either by the arms or the liberality of the emperor from every part of syria regular succession of convoys safely arrived in the camp which was increased by the return of probus with his victorious troops from the conquest of egypt it was then that zenobia resolved to ﬂy she mounted the ﬂeetest of her dromedaries and had already reached the banks of the euphrates about sixty miles from palmyra when she was overtaken by the pursuit of aurelian light horse seized and brought back captive to the feet of the emperor her capital soon afterward surrendered and was treated with unexpected lenity when the syrian queen was brought into the presence of aurelian he sternly asked her how she had presumed to rise in arms against the emperors of rome the answer of zenobia was prudent mixture of respect and ﬁrmness because i disdained to consider roman emperors an aureolus or gallienus you alone i acknowledg my conqueror and my sovereign but female fortitude is commonly artiﬁcia l so it is 234 235 236

licentious fury of the tribes of germany and scythia the proclamation of alaric when he forced his entrance into vanquished city discovered however some regard the laws of humanity and religion he encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valor and to enrich themselves with the spoils of wealthy and effeminate people but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens and to respect the churches of the apostles peter and paul holy and inviolable sanctuaries amidst the horrors of nocturnal tumult several of the christian goths displayed the fervor of recent conversion and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related and perhaps adorned by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers while the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey the humble dwelling of an aged virgin who had devoted her life to the service of the altar was forced open by one of the powerful goths he immediately demanded tho in civil language all the gold and silver in her possession and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship the barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition till he was interrupted by serious admonition addrest to him in the followin g words these said she are the consecrated vessels

he had discovered and received peremptory order from alaric that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported without damage or delay to the church of the apostle from the extremity perhaps of the quirinal hill to the distant quarter of the vatican numerous detachment of goths marching in order of battle through the principal streets protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the soun d of religious psalmody from all the adjacent houses crowd of christians hastened to join this edifying procession and multitude of fugitives without distinction of age or rank or even of sect had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the vatican the learned work concerning the city of god was professedly composed by augustine to justify the ways of providence in the destruction of the roman greatness he celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of christ and insults his adver saries by challenging them to produce some similar example of town taken by storm in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries in the sack of rome some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded but the holy precincts of the vatican and the apostolic churches could receive very small proportion of the roman people many thousand warriors more especially of the huns who served under the standard of alaric were strangers to the name or at least to the faith of christ and we may suspect without any breach of charity or candor that in the hour of savage license when every passion was inﬂamed and every restraint was removed the precepts of the gospel seldom inﬂuenced the behavior of the gothic christians the writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confest that cruel slaughter was made of the romans and that the streets of the city were ﬁlled with dead bodies which remained without burial during the general consternation the despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble the innocent and the helpless the private revenge of forty thousand slaves was exercised without pity or remorse and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families the matrons and virgins of rome were exposed to injuries more dreadful in the apprehension of chastity than death itself the want of youth or beauty or chastity protected the greatest part of the roman women from the danger of rape but avarice is an insatiate and universal passion since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth in the pillage of rome just preference was given to gold and jewels which contain the greates t value in the smallest compass and weight but after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers the palaces of rome were rudely stript of their splendid and costly furniture the sideboards of massy plate and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple were irregularly piled in the wagons that always followed the march of gothic army the most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed many statue was melted the sake of the precious materials and many vase in the division of the spoil was shivered into fragments by the stroke of the acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians who proceeded by threats by blows and by tortures to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure visible splendor and expense were alleged the proof of plentiful fortune the appearance of poverty was imputed to parsimonious disposition and the obstinacy of some misers who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection was fatal to many unhappy wretches who expired under the lash refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures the ediﬁces of rome tho the damage has been much exaggerated received some injury from the violence of the goths at their entrance through the salarian gate they ﬁred the 239 240 241 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x great britain and ireland ii

and the ruins of the palace of sallust remained in the age of justinian stately monument of the gothic conﬂagration yet contemporary historian has observed that ﬁre could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass and that the strength of man was insufﬁcient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion that the wrath of heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage and that the proud forum of rome decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes was leveled in the dust by the stroke of lightning v the dea th of

vicissitudes of fortune which spares neither man nor the proudest of his works which buries empires and cities in common grave and it was agreed that in proportion to her former greatness the fall of rome was the more awful and deplorable her primeval state such she might appear in remote age when evander entertained the stranger of troy has been delineated by the fancy of virgil this tarpeian rock was then savage and solitary thicket in the time of the poet it was crowned with the golden roofs of temple the temple is overthrown the gold has been pillaged the wheel of fortune has accomplished her revolution and the sacred ground is again disﬁgured with thorns and brambles the hill of the capitol on which we sit was formerly the head of the roman empire the citadel of the earth the terror of kings illustrated by the footsteps of so many triumphs enriched with the spoils and tributes of so many nations this spectacle of the world how is it fallen how changed how defaced the

britain and ireland ii by various https more visible from the stupendous relics that have survived the injuries of time and after diligent inquiry i can discern four principal causes of the ruin of rom which continued to operate in period of more than thousand years the injuries of time and nature ii the hostile attacks of the barbarians and christians iii the use and abuse of the materials and iv the domestic quarrels of the romans the art of man is able to construct monu ments far more permanent than the narrow span of his own existence yet these monuments like himself are perishable and frail and in the boundless annals of time his life and his labors must equally be measured ﬂeeting moment of simple and solid ediﬁce it is not easy however to circum scribe the duration the wonder of ancient days the pyramids attracted the curiosity of the ancients hundred generations the leaves of autumn have dropt into the grave and after the fall of the pharaohs and ptolem ies the cæsars and caliphs the same pyramids stand erect and unshaken above the ﬂoods of the nile complex ﬁgure of various and minute parts is more accessible to injury and decay and the silent lapse of time is often accelerated by hurricanes and earthquakes by ﬁres and inundations the air and earth have doubtless been shaken and the lofty turrets of rome have tottered from their foundations but the seven hills not appear to be placed on the great cavities of the globe nor has the city in any age been exposed to the convulsions of nature which in the climate of antioch lisbon or lima have crumbled in few moments the works of ages in the dust fire is the most powerful agent of life and death from her situation rome is exposed to the danger of frequent inundations without excepting the tiber the rivers that descend from either side of the apennine have short and irregular course shallow stream in the summer heats an impetuous torrent when it is swelled in the spring or winter by the fall of rain and the melting of the snows when the current is repelled from the sea by adverse winds when the ordinary bed is inadequate to the weight of waters they rise above the banks and overspread without limits or control the plains and cities of the adjacent country soon after the triumph of the ﬁrst punic war the tiber was increased by unusual rains and the inundation surpassing all former measure of time and place destroyed all the buildings that were situate below the hills of rome according to the variety of ground the same mischief was produced by different means and the ediﬁces were either swept away by the sudden impulse or dissolved and undermined by the long continuance of the ﬂood under the reign of augustus the same calamity was renewed the lawless river overtu rned the palaces and temples on its banks and after the labors of the emperor in cleansing and widening the bed that was incumbered with ruins the vigilance of his successors was exercised by similar dangers and designs the project of diverting into new channels the tiber itself or some of the dependent streams was long opposed by superstition and local interests nor did the use compensate the toil and costs of the tardy and imperfect execution the servitude of rivers is the noblest and most important victory which man has obtained over the licentiousness of nature and if such were the ravages of the tiber under ﬁrm and active government what could oppose or who can enumerate the injuries of the city after the fall of the western empire remedy was at length produced by the evil itself the accumulation of rubbish and the earth that has been wash ed down from the hills is supposed to have elevated the plain of rome fourteen or ﬁfteen feet perhaps above the ancient level and the modern city is less accessible to the attacks of the river ii the crowd of writers of every nation who impute the destruction of the roman monuments to the goths and the christians have neglected to inquire how far they were animated by hostile principle and how far they possest the means and the leisure to satiate their enmity in the preceding volumes of this history i have described the triumph of barbarism and religion and i can only resume in few words their real or imaginary connection with the ruin of ancient rome our fancy may create or adopt pleasing romance that the goths and vandals sallied from scandinavia ardent to avenge the ﬂight of odin to break the chains and to chastise the oppressors of mankind that they wished 248 249 250 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x great britain and ireland ii by various https burn the records of classic literature and to found their national architecture on the broken members of the tuscan and corinthian orders but in simple truth the northern conquerors were neither sufﬁciently savage nor sufﬁciently reﬁned to entertain such aspiring ideas of destruction and reven ge the shepherds of scythia and germany had been educated in the armies of the empire whose discipline they acquired and whose weakness they invaded with the familiar use of the latin tongue they had learned to reverence the name and titles of rome and tho incapable of emulating they were more inclined to admire than to abolish the arts and studies of brighter period in the transient possession of rich and unresisting capital the soldiers of alaric and genseric were stimulated by the passions of victorious army amidst the wanton indulgence of lust or cruelty portable wealth was the object of their search nor could they derive either pride or pleasure from the unproﬁtable reﬂection that they had battered to the ground the works of the consuls and cæsars their moments were indeed precious the goths evacuated rome on the sixth the vandals on the ﬁfteenth day and tho it be far more difﬁcult to build than to destroy their hasty assault would have made slight impression on the solid piles of antiquity we may remember that both alaric and genseric affected to spare the building s of the city that they subsisted in strength and beauty under the auspicious government of theodoric and that the momentary resentment of totila was disarmed by his own temper and the advice of his friends and enemies from these innocent barbarians the reproach may be transferre d to the catholics of rome the statues altars and houses of the demons were an abom ination in their eyes and in the absolute command of the city they might labor with zeal and perseverance to erase the idolatry of their ancestors the demolition of the temples in the east affords to them an example of conduct and to us an argument of belief and it is probable that portion of guilt or merit may be imputed with justice to the roman proselytes yet their abhorrence was conﬁned to the monuments of heathen superstition and the civil structures that were dedicated to the business or pleasure of society might be preserved without injury or scandal the change of religion was accomplished not by popular tumult but by the decrees of the emperors of the senate and of time of the christian hierarchy the bishops of rome were commonly the most prudent and least fanatic nor can any positive charge be opposed to the meritorious act of saving and converting the majestic structure of the pantheon iii the value of any object that supplies the wants or pleasures of mankind is compounded of its substance and its form of the materials and the manufacture its price must depend on the number of persons by whom it may be acquired and used on the extent of the market and consequently on the ease or difﬁculty of remote exportation according to the nature of the commodity its local situation and the temporary circumstances of the world the barbarian conquerors of rome usurped in moment the toil and treasure of successive ages but except the luxuries of immediate consumption they must view without desire all that could not be removed from the city in the gothic wagons or the ﬂeet of the vandals gold and silver were the ﬁrst objects of their avarice in every country and in the smallest compass they represent the most ample command of the industry and possessions of mankind vase or statue of those precious metals might tempt the vanity of some barbarian chief but the grosser multitude regardless of the form was tenacious only of the substance and the melted ingots might be readily divided and stamped into the current coin of the empire the less active or less fortunate robbers were reduced to the baser plunder of brass lead iron and copper whatever had escaped the goths and vandals was pillaged by the greek tyrants and the emperor constans in his rapacious visit stript the bronze tiles from the roof of the pantheon the ediﬁces of rome might be considered vast and various mine the ﬁrst labor of extracting the materials was already performed the metals were puriﬁed and cast the marbles were hewn and polished and after foreign and domestic rapine had been satiated the remains of the city could purchaser have been found were still venal the monuments of antiquity had been left naked of their precious ornaments but the romans would demolish with their own hands the arches and walls if the hope of proﬁt could surpass the cost of the labor and exportation if charlemagne had ﬁxt in italy the seat of 251 252 253 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol iv of x great britain and ireland ii by various https western empire his genius would have aspired to restore rather than to violate the works of the cæsars but policy conﬁned the french monarch to the forests of germany his taste could be gratiﬁed only by destruction and the new palace of was decorated with the marbles of ravenna and rome five hundred years after charlemagne king of sicily the wisest and most liberal sovereign of the age supplied with the same materials by the easy navigation of the tiber and the sea and petrarch sighs an indignant complaint that the ancient capital of the world should adorn from her own bowels the slothful luxury of naples but these examples of plunder or purchase were rare in the darker ages and the romans alone and unenvied might have appli ed to their private or public use the remaining structures of antiquity if in their present form and situation they had not been useless in great measure to the city and its inhabitants the walls still described the old circumference but the city had descended from the seven hills into the campus martius and some of the noblest monuments which had braved the injuries of time were left in desert far remote from the habitations of mankind iv i have reserved the last the most potent and forcible cause of destru ction the domestic hostilities of the romans themselves under the dominion of the greek and french emperors the peace of the city was disturbed by accidental tho frequent seditions it is from the decline of the latter from the beginning of the tenth century that we may date the licentiousness of private war which violated with impunity the laws of the code and the gospel without respecting the majesty of the absent sovereign or the presence and person of the vicar of christ in dark period of ﬁve hundred years rome was perpetually afﬂicted by the sanguinary quarrels of the nobles and the people the guelphs and ghibelines the colonna and ursini and if much has escaped the knowledge and much is unworthy of the notice of history i have exposed in the two prece ding chapters the causes and effects of the public disorders at such time when every quarrel was decided by the sword and none could trust their lives or properties to the impotence of law the powerful citizens were armed safety or offense against the domestic enemies whom they feared or hated except venice alone the same dangers and designs were common to all the free republics of italy and the nobles usurped the prerogative of fortifying their houses and erecting strong towers that were capable of resisting sudden attack the cities were ﬁlled with these hostile ediﬁces and the example of lucca which contained three hundred towers her law which conﬁned their height to the measure of feet may be extended with suitable latitude to the more opulent and populous states the ﬁrst step of the senator brancaleone in the establishment of peace and justice was to demolish we have already seen one hundred and forty of the towers of rome and in the last days of anarchy and discord late the reign of martin the fifth still stood in one of the thirteen or fourteen regions of the city to this mischievous purpose the rema ins of antiquity were most readily adapted the temples and arches afforded broad and solid basis the new structures of brick and stone and we can name the modern turrets that were raised on the triumphal monuments of julius cæsar titus and the antonines with some slight alterations theater an amphitheater mausoleum was transformed into strong and spacious citadel i need not repeat that the mole of adrian has assumed the title and form of the castle of angelo the septizonium of severus was capable of standing against royal army the sepulcher of metella has sunk under its outworks the theaters of pompey and marcellus were occupied by the savelli and orsini families and the rough fortress has been gradually softened to the splendor and elegance of an italian palace the fame of julius the second leo the tenth and sixtus the fifth is accompanied by the superior merit of bramante and fontana of raphael and michael angelo and the same muniﬁcence which had been displayed in palaces and temples was directed with equal zeal to revive and emulate the labors of antiquity prostrate obelisks were raised from the ground and erected in the most conspicuous places of the eleven aqueducts of the cæsars 254 255 256 the project gutenberg ebook of the best
