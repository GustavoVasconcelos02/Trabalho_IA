accompanied by accurate collations of the original editions of the books and pamphlets of geor ge borrow together with list of his many contributions to magazines and other publications it will doubtless be observed that inconsiderable portion of the bibliography deals with the attractive series of pamphlets containing ballads poems and other works by borrow which were printed private circulation during the course of last year some account of the origin of these pamphlets and some information regarding the material of which they are composed may not be considered inopportune or inappropriate writer of english prose borrow long since achieved the position which was his due writer of english verse he has yet to come by his own the neglect from which borrow s poetical compositions by far the lar ger proportion of which are translations from the danish and other tongues have suf fered has arisen from one cause and from one cause alone fact that up to the present moment only his earliest and in the majority of cases his least successful ef forts have been available to students of his work in 1826 when borrow passed his romantic ballads through the press he had already acquired working knowledge of numerous languages and dialects but of his native tongue he had still to become master in 1826 his appreciation of the requirements of english prosody was of vague description his sense of the rhythm of verse was crude and the attention he paid to the exigencies of rhyme was inadequate hence the majority of his ballads beyond the fact that they were faithful reproductions of the originals from which they had been laboriously translated were of particular value but to borrow himself they were objects of regard which amounted to af fection and there can be question that throughout considerable portion of his adventurous life he looked to his ballads to win him whatever measure of literary fame it might eventually be his fortune to gain in lavengr and other of his prose works he repeatedly referred to his bundle of ballads and i doubt whether he ever really relinquished all hope of placing them before the public until the last decade of his life had well advanced that the ballad poetry of the old northern races should have held strong attraction borrow is not to be wondered at his restless nature and his roving habits were well in tune with the spirit of the old heroic ballads whilst his taste all that was mythical or vagabond vagabond in the literal and not in the conventional sense of the word would prompt him to welcome with common eagerness the old poems dealing with matters supernatural and legendary has he not himself recorded how when fatigued upon tiring march he roused his ﬂagging spirits by shouting the refrain look out look out svend v onved in 1829 three years after the romantic ballads had struggled into existence borrow made an ef fort to place them before lar ger public in more complete and imposing

scheme lapsed borrow found his mission in other ﬁelds of labour and not until 1854 did he again attempt to revive it but in 1854 borrow made one more very serious ef fort to give his ballads life in that year he again took them in hand subjected many of them to revision of the most drastic nature and proceeded to prepare them ﬁnally press advertisements which he drew up are still extant in his handwriting and reduced facsimiles of two of these may be seen upon the opposite page but again fate was against him and neither kœmpe v iser nor songs of eur ope ever saw the light 0b bibliography of

webber bookseller of ipswich who resold them to dr william knapp these manuscripts are now in the hands of the hispanic society of new york and will doubtless remain ever the property of the american people fortunately when disposing of the bulk of her s books and papers to mr webber macoubrey retained the manuscripts of the ballads together with certain other documents of interest and importance it was from these manuscripts that i was af forded the opportunity of preparing the series of pamphlets printed last year the manuscripts themselves are of four descriptions firstly the manuscripts of certain of the new ballads prepared the songs of scandinavia in 1829 untouched and originally written 0c secondly other of these new ballads heavily corrected by borrow in later handwriting thirdly fresh transcripts with the revised texts made in or about 1854 of ballads written in 1829 and lastly some of the more important ballads originally published in 1826 entirely in 1854 and the text thoroughly revised will be seen from the few examples i have given in the following pages or better still from perusal of the pamphlets the value literature of borrow s ballads we now know them is

by means ridiculous or feel assured that borrow s metrical work will in future receive far more cordial welcome from his readers and will meet with fuller appreciation from his critics than that which until now it has been its fortune to secure despite the unctuous phrases which in obedience to the promptings of the secretaries of the british and foreign bible society 0d whose interests he forwarded with so much enterprise and vigor he was at times constrained to introduce into his ofﬁcial letters borrow was at heart pagan the memory of his father that he cherished most warmly was that

quarterly review the modern literature and things of wales were not introduced into the article and it appeared anonymously in the quarterly review january it is in fact borrow s own and the only

or review is not at present forthcoming but fortunately the of certain paragraphs with which borrow brought the essay to conclusion and which the editor in the exercise of his editorial function quite properly struck out have been preserved the barefaced manner in which borrow anonymously praised and advertised his own work fully justiﬁed the editor s action i print these paragraphs below my principal reason doing so is this that the closing lines afford evidence of borrow s authorship of other portions of gill s introduction to his edition of kelly s manx grammar 1859 beyond those which until now have been attributed to his pen our having mentioned the romany r ye gives us an opportunity of saying few words concerning that work to the merits of which and likewise to those of lavengr of which it is the sequel adequate justice has never been awarded it is truly remarkable book abounding not only with strange and amusing adventure but with deep learning communicated in highly agreeable form we owe it an amende honorable not having in our recent essay on buddhism quoted from it some remarkable passages on that superstition which are to be found in conversation between the hero of the tale and the man in black never was the subject of buddhism treated in manner so masterly and original but the book exhibits what is inﬁnitely more precious than the deepest learning more desirable than the most amusing treasury of adventure fearless honest spirit resolution to tell the truth however strange the truth may appear to the world remarkable proof of this is to be found in what is said in it respecting the italians it is all very well at the present day after the miracles lately performed in italy by her sons to say that italy is the land to which we must look great men that it is not merely the country of singers ﬁddlers improvisatori and linguists but of men of beings who may emphatically be called men but who three or four years ago would have ventured to say much why there was one and only one who ventured to say so and that was geor ge borrow in his work entitled the romany r ye many other things equally bold and true he has said in that work and also in its predecessor lavengr in conclusion we wish to give mr borrow piece of advice namely that with all convenient speed he publish whatever works he has written and has not yet committed to the press life is very precarious and when an author dies his unpublished writings are too frequently either lost to the world or presented in shape which all but stultiﬁes them of mr borrow s unpublished writings there is catalogue at the end of the romany r ye and most remarkable catalogue it is comprising works on all kinds of interesting subjects of these the one which we are most eager to see is that which is called wild w ales which we have doubt whenever it appearsp 298 bibliography of the writings in prose and verse of george henry borrow https be welcomed heartily the bible in spain was seventeen years ago book which ﬁrst laid open the mysterious peninsula to the eyes of the world and that the book on wales will be followed by the one which is called wanderings in quest of manx literatur now the title alone of that book is worth library of commonplace works it gives the world an inkling of thing it never before dreamed of namely that the little celtic isle of man has vernacular literature
