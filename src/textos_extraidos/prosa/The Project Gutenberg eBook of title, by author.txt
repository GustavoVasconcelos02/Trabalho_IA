which he draws but since bird portrait matter how accurate can show its subject in only one position singing feeding ﬂying or sitting short account of some of the main events of the bird life has been added to each pictur any one who learns from such books how beset with perils is the life of every wild creatur will take the greatest pains at all times and especially in the nesting season not only not to injur or persecute such defenseless little creatur es our song birds but also to protect them in every way whoever seeks their acquaintance in the spirit of friendship will always be grateful the interest and pleasur to be gained from such friends of the twenty birds whose portraits are here presented majority are only summer residents in the northern states some visit us only in winter few spend the whole year near the same spot the birds which are ﬁrst described are those that are most closely associated with the return of spring then follow those whose gay colors and bright songs give much of its charm to early summer last come those that brave even in the north the tempests of winter bird the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https song sp arrow after severe winter while snow and ice still remind us of the past the song sparrow mounting to the top of some bush or small tree repeats his cheerful tinkling song helping thoreau says to crack the ice in the ponds few people are so unobservant not to notice this bright strain after the silence of winter peculiarity of the song is the amount of variation shown by different individuals and often by the same bird at almost regular distances along the bushy roadside or over the ﬁelds one will meet on the early spring mornings one song sparrow after another each restricted to his part of the road or ﬁeld if one notices the songs of each it is evident that though the songs have the same general character there are almost many ways of beginning strain there are singers moreover the same bird has been observed to alter his song in short space of time to two or three different variations probably if one ear were acute enough all birds of one species would be found to sing with slight differences but few show in so marked degree the song sparrow the tendency to variation which characterizes species in early april the song sparrow builds nest of grass either on the ground beneath tuft of grass or under some brambles or less frequently few feet above the groun d in bush or on the lower limbs of tree in the latter situation twigs are of course necessary the support of the structure here again the bird shows tendency to vary in its habits the eggs are from four to ﬁve in number greenish white thickly marked with shades of brown lavender or purple sometimes an egg is found in the nest much larger than the others this has been laid by the lazy cowbird the large egg receives most warmth and hatches ﬁrst the young cowbird soon crowds out the rightful occupants of the nest and the parent song sparrows will be seen later working busily to feed great homely youngster large themselves who will afterwards go off to join ﬂock of his own kind prob ably every cowbird has been reared at the expense of brood of some small bird sparrow warbler or vireo in june the young song sparrows are able to take care of themselves and the energetic parents build another nest and rear another brood the brooding time is the chief period of song so that birds that breed twice sing later in the summer than others the song sparrow little strain may be heard well into august but toward the end of that month we hear from the cornﬁelds and gardens curious husky warble unlike the bright spring carol of the song sparrow but nevertheless made by that bird in the fall and even during the winter warm bright day will occasionally induce song sparrow to sing his lively spring song so that where the song sparrow winters the strain may be heard every month of the year in the late summer and fall the neglected corners of gardens and ﬁelds where the seeds of weeds and grasses offer an abundance of food are the favorite resort of the sparrows the song sparrow may be distinguished from most of its relatives by its streaked breast in the middle of which the spots generally form conspicuous blotch and by its long tail which it constantly jerks it ﬂies the song sparrow is very retiring and when alarmed slips into brush heaps or bushes where it hides skillfully the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https flicker the flicker is most beloved in march when his hearty shout is one of the characteristic sounds of the ﬁrst warm days of early spring the same week which brings the bluebird and the blackbird hears the cheerful song of the song sparrow and the loud call of the flicker though woodpecker the flicker has departed somewhat from the habits of its relatives spending considerable time on the ground and depending largely its food on berries and ants it is often startled from lawns and hillsides where it has been thrusting its long tongue into colonies of black ants seizing them on the moist brushy tip when so engaged the bird may sometimes be closely approac hed and sight of its plumage is then revelation to one who has seen from distance only its dark brown body and white rump the ashy gray nape sets off bright red patch there is handsome black crescent across the breast and the male wears black mustaches the breast is handsomely spotted and the quills and undersides of the wing and tail feathers are golden yellow unless one can steal up close to bird few of these marks show but the flicker may always be distinguished by his size he is the largest of our common birds except the crow by the white rump and the gleam of yellow which has given him the name woodpecker the ﬂight too like that of all the woodpeckers is characteristic the wing strokes are slow and between them the bird drops little so that its progress is in waves instead of in straight line all the woodpeckers nest in holes which they chisel out of decayed or even live wood circular entrance leads to vertical passage and this to wide chamber some distance below lining of moss or feathers is put in the pure white nearly round eggs are laid directly on the chips at the bottom of the cavity and the young birds after few days hang by their claws to the side of the hole young flickers like young are fed by their parents with liquid food which is pumped into their mouths the parent bill being thrust far into the young one the flicker is one of the few birds that frequently return to the old nest most birds contrary to the common notion instead of refurnishing the weather and insecure structure into which their last year home has been converted by snow rain and wind prefer to build new one the material is everywhere at hand and time is not so precious before the young are hatched the flicker however having built in stout limb can safely return several seasons to the same cavity or if this becomes insecure can cut another in the same trunk branches are often seen where three or four round openings show the tenements of several generations of these noisy birds south of massachusetts flickers generally spend the whole year in one spot and in winter live largely on berries favorite food at this season is the berry of the poison ivy in the fall the rum cherry becomes resort all species the flicker though not known to raise second brood has second period of song so that we hear again in june the shout or mating call of the early spring days beside s this pitched wick wick wick the flicker utters when startled curious note like worr oo sharp is the call to its kind and the syllable s yucker yucker often accompanied by ludicrous bowing with wings and tail outspread are used to show af the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https brown the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https brown thrasher the thrasher is the ﬁrst great musician of the year he arrives in the last week of april so that his song forms the prelude of the chorus which is given in may by the true thrushes the bobolink and the oriole there is spirit brilliancy of execution and power in his song which is perhaps more appropriate to early spring than the rich sweet tone of the birds who take up the strain in warmer days he sings when spring though assured is not everywhere manifest and the vigor of his ringing phrases serves to dispel any lingering doubt that the may yet entertain the trees are yet leaﬂess and the singer can be seen afar off on the very topmost twig of some hillside tree his long tail is held straight below him his head is and from his full throat comes phrase after phrase succession of the most varied and apparently extremely difﬁcult notes executed with an ease and joy which to the ears of many place the thrasher in the class with the true thrushes like the song of all male birds the performance is not only an offering or an invitation to the female but also an answer to some rival whose fainter notes reach the ear from the neighboring grove this last week of april is often one of the most delightful seasons of the year and particularly attractive to beginner in bird study there are only few bushes in leaf and those of delicate green the dried leaves under them are starred with white bloodroot on the hillsides the purple violet and yellow are wide open in the warm sun and in the woods the mayﬂower and the hepatica surprise the visitor in spots where the late snow still lingers the birds are easy to ﬁnd there is dense foliage to hide them and the number of species is still so few that their songs and ﬁgures are not difﬁcult to distinguish the thrasher song ceases you approach him he slips down like wren to the under growth where if you listen you hear him rustling and scratching in the dry leaves if you sit down near by you will see him he mounts again from one twig to the next his white breast is heavily spotted with black his head back and tail are of bright rufous shade and his yellow eye glitters like snake when he is alarmed he puffs like turtle or utters note curiously like loud smack the whole air of the bird is one of vigor and intelligence the sexes are alike in size and color by watching patiently near the spot where the male sings it is often possible to surprise the pair bringing bark and roots to the bush among whose roots or stems the nest is woven it is one of the most delightful experiences in the study of birds thus to watch pair of birds building their nest to note later the laying of each egg to see the female brooding till the nestlings are hatched and ﬁnally leave the nest one always heaves sigh of relief at the last moment so many tragedies may put an end to the story the female thrasher is very bold when on the nest and sits close till the visitor if he approach quietly is within few feet of her she gazes ﬁxedly at him with her bright eye but let him draw step nearer and she slips off into the bushes the eggs are four or ﬁve whitish covered with many light brown markings the food of the thrasher consists of insects and fruit many linger in the north till the end of october and spend the winter in the southern states where the ground is generally free from snow the project gutenberg ebook of

on some part of his house itself visit an old farmhouse look about and see how many welcome guests the farmer shelters without thought of pecuniary proﬁt under the woodshed on beam the phœbe has built nest of moss from which she ﬂies to the barnyard to pursue the insects that swarm there in the vines on the piazza robins and chipping sparrows have reared their young in the old elm over the door an oriole has woven nest with thread twitched from the clothesline or perhaps purposely laid out her and the orchard shelters numbers of woodpeckers kingbirds and chebecs of all these tenants however none seem so completely at home the swallows none show so little concern at man presence none take possession so coolly of the boxes the eaves or the rafters where they build their kindred lived with man ages ago in greece and rome they have been welcomed each spring heralds of joyful season their departure has been watched with regret though they have but few notes which are musical yet their grace agility and swiftness have passed into proverb and song there are several species of swallow or martin which take advantage of man structures in or on which to place their nests but the most numerous the most familiar to people in general and perhaps the most attractiv is the barn swallow this is the only species whose outer tail feathers are long and pointed and form with the rest of the tail the peculiar ﬁgure known the head back wings and tail are all of beautiful lustrous blue and the tail when spread shows large white spots in the inner feathers the under parts vary from whitish in immature birds to rich chestnut in fully mature ones who have also the throat and forehead of darker reddish brown the bill opens far back so that there is wide cavity to engulf any insect which may be met in the ceaseless ﬂight backward and forward over grass and water the nest of the barn swallow is familia r to all who have enjoyed life on farm it is made of straws and grass plastered together with mud and is placed on beam or rafter in the barn one hospitable farmer drove horseshoe into beam and on this ledge swallow built each year through the open door or window of the barn the swallows ﬂy in and out and up into the gloom above where twittering sounds tell of young that are being fed soon the young are old enough the parents urge them to ﬂy and in few days they become skillful enough to take food on the wing this is an extremely pretty spectacle the parent and the young meet and then ﬂy upward an instant their breasts apparently touching while the food is passed from one bill to the other one july afternoon the writer watched row of six young swallows clinging to the shingles on barn roof every mouth gaping food whenever the parents approached when the father brought the food the bird sitting nearest him got the mouthful and in an instant later another from the mother five times in succession this favored youngster was fed while the other ﬁve seemed neglected but when the little fellow had all that he could hold he went to sleep and the next mouth received the food what seemed at ﬁrst an unfair arrangement was after all the surest way to feed all

belongs to the swallow family it is in fact relative of the swallows but very nearly related to the whippoorwill and swifts and swallows both have long powe rful wings which enable them to remain long periods on the wing in restless search insects scientists themselves were long time misled by the resemblance in the appearance and habits of the two families but close examination of the skeleton of the two birds has convinced naturalists that the two families descended from different ancestor s but have arrived at similar solutions of the problem presented to them in their search food the swift builds is well known in the ﬂues of chimneys it is often seen in may dashing past the dead twigs of some tree and then off to the chimney where the twigs are glued together and to the bricks by the help of saliva secreted by the bird common and distressing experience after storm in summer is the discovery of the young chimney swifts at the wrong end of the chimney the hearth in other words even in their proper place in the chimney the young birds can make their presence very well known by beginning soon it is light an incessant clamor food the long narrow wings the powerful chest muscles the cut of the bird body and the way the keel is ballasted so to speak enable the bird to remain hours in constant ﬂight without apparently experiencing the least fatigue swallows are often seen resting on telegraph wires but i have never seen swift perch on any support outside chimney at night and during such part of the day is given up to rest the bird supports itself in chimneys by clinging to projections or crevices the stiff tail feathers aid greatly in supporting it before the coming of the white man hollow trees served the roosting and nesting places of the swifts there is better practice the eye than distinguishing swallows from swifts when both species are mingled in the air the swift ﬂight though very powerful suggests that of the bat on account of the frequency of the wing strokes the rapid beating of the wings ceases at intervals and the bird glides through the air or turns on set wings then the twinkling ﬂight begins again there are none of those long sweeping strokes with which the barn swallow cleaves the air the tail of the swift when the bird is ﬂying generally appears short and cigar or if spread it is not forked like the tails of all the swallows the ordinary note of the swift is single sharp cry slowly or rapidly repeated it is characteristic of warm summer evenings when the birds ﬂy about the houses in twos or threes pursuing each other and uttering this note staccato pretty sight at this time is the swift sailing with wings raised above the body in the position of our common pigeon just before alighting the swift assumes the same attitude above the chimney poising moment before he drops into the ﬂue early in september the swifts leave the north and may be seen high overhead ﬂying southward unlike many of our small birds they migrate by day their powers of ﬂight protecting them from the birds of prey which are such menace to the smaller the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https kingbird the swallows and swifts spend hours on the wing turning to the right or to the left upward or back in pursuit of winged insects many other birds notably the warbler family take occasional ﬂights after some insect which they have startled from the leaves the habits of another large family of birds the flycatchers are compromise between these two methods of obtaining food selecting some post of observation such dead limb fence or the stalk of stout weed they wait patiently keeping sharp watch of the air about them at sight of an insect ﬂying near they ﬂy out in pursuit if one is near enough to the bird click of its bill will announce the fate of the insect the flycatchers then return to the same or neighboring perch the family is not on the whole very in fact they might justly be accused of irritability and pugnacity the kingbi rd in particular the head of the house is noted his constant attacks on any winged creature that approaches his nest it must be admitted however that when nesting time is over he lives very peaceably with his neighbors but while the female is brooding the eggs or young the excited cry of the male is constantly heard and every crow that comes in sight is pursued sometimes mile the kingbird gets above his victim and darts down at its head the crow can be seen wincing at each vicious jab of the bill one or two observers have actually seen the kingbird ride on the crow back some distance the kingbird has patch of red concealed under the black feathers of his crown when he is angry or excited these red feathers blaze out they are very rarely seen by men but i imagine the crows see them oftener than they like apple trees in old orchards are favorite nesting places of the kingbird and pains are taken to conceal the nest it is composed of twigs loosely laid together and often festooned with white strings or the dry woolly heads of the everlasting the inside of the nest is neatly lined with feathers horsehair or roots and contains from three to ﬁve white eggs spotted with brown the kingbird is here from the ﬁrst of may to the ﬁrst of september but like all strictly insectivorous birds it must spend the winte r far to the southward the bird only notes are the shrill cries kipper kipper given singly or quickly repeated in spring the birds often mount to considerable height uttering this cry continually and apparently attempting by this exhibition to express the emoti on common to all creatures at this period of the year the kingbird is very satisfactory bird to beginners the color pattern is so marked and the bird is so fond of exposed situations that it is seen and recognized without difﬁc ulty except the cedarbird whose tail is tipped with yellow i know other small bird of the eastern united states whose tail feathers are all tipped with regular edge of light color the kingbird is the bird most commonly seen from car window in almost every ﬁeld the mullein stalks or wire fences will display one or more individuals their white breasts or black and white tails showing conspicuously in the landscape the kingbird has often been accuse d of destroying honeybees even allowing that individuals occasionally some damage in this way the good services of the race in destroying harmful insects far outweigh these injuries and the remedy is to drive the bird away from the hives not to kill the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https bal timore the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https bal timore oriole the arrival of the orioles in the ﬁrst week of may marks many people the return of spring the males come ﬁrst and take possession at once of our streets and gardens calling from the elms or dashing into the cherry trees white with blossoms the fema les arrive day or two later and the work of begins soon after in the selection of nesting site the judgment of the female alone is naturally allowed to have entire weight the male is politely anxious ﬂying from twig to twig if recommending them but the female knows that she must sit days over her precious eggs and be swung by all manner of storms in whatever situation she ﬁnally selects she means therefore to be sure before she builds the number of trees on which hang two nests one evidently older than the other is very noticeable and probably means that the same pair return to the same tree to build many people have an idea that birds use the same nest in successive years but it does not seem likely that such skillful architect the oriole would patch up the old nest when with few days labor she can build new one clean and strong and very likely impr oved by her former experience the materials used the construction of the nest are tough ﬁbrous strips the framework and softer materials the lining the female often comes to the clothesline and twitches out some threads and she is very thankful twine or similar material hung out where she can ﬁnd it lowell who loved the oriole next after the bobolink hung out threads his birds and was rewarded with the sight of brilliant nest the female builds at ﬁrst framework of strong material which is attached to the several twigs on which the nest hangs she actually ties knots of this material with her long sharp bill thrusting the end of the thread through loop then reaching over and pulling it tight tragedies sometimes occur during this process the bird becoming entangled in her own thread and choking or starving to death bit of comedy is sometimes seen when the oriole returning to her nest catches summer in the act of stealing some of the material after the frame is completed the oriole works from inside weaving the web from side to side by june the young hatch and now the male who has hitherto had an easy time becomes very busy bringing food to the young in few days they become old enough to cry it very vigorously and this they so incessantly that their becomes one of the characteristic sounds of early summer by the middle of july the young leave the nest and then week or two the whole family are met with in the country lanes the children resembling their mother in color but easily distinguished by their short tails and the general downy look about the head the male suffers an eclipse during midsummer his cheerful whistle is longer heard and we should think that he had already left the south did he not resume his strain in august in fact he has been moulting but unlike the tanager he replaces his bright feathers by others gay and before he leaves us he is bright when he came the wild cherry trees are now favorite resort the whole family but by the ﬁrst of september they leave the northern states and return to central and south america where they lead careless life till the approach of spring reminds them of the village elms thousand miles away the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https wood the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https wood thrush it is difﬁcult to speak without enthusiasm of the song of thrush he seems wholly to outclass all other birds when grosbeak mean singer our birds go has ﬁnished his song let wood thrush utter but phrase of his strain and the grosbeak warble seems commonplace except the thrushes we have few birds whose song appeals to the imagination human music does we listen curiously to the songs of the others criticise them or comment on them we on landscape but let thrush sing and we fall into reverie recalling sad tender or solemn ideas and associations the wood thrush and the veery or wilson thrush are the common thrushes of all but the northern part of the northern states in the mountains the hermit thrush is found this bird is generally considered superior even to the wood thrush in the purity and solemnity of its cadences it has one great advanta ge over its rival it sings on mountain sides in clear still air so that the ﬁnest vibrations of its voice come to the ear with perfect distinctness the song of the two thrushes is readily distinguished by listening the phrase with which the wood thrush regularly opens his chant the veery has received its name in imitation of its song which resembles the syllables each phrase lower in the scale than the preceding the wood thrush arrives in the northern states in may and unlike the veery which is strangely silent on its ﬁrst arrival the male wood thrush announces his presence on the morning of his arrival by chanting from some low limb his beautiful notes in the middle states it is common and almost familiar bird building in the gardens even of large towns but in wilder regions it prefers copses groves of young trees and rocky glens particularly if there is stream near by by the end of may the pair have ﬁnished their nest which resembles that of the robin but is often composed of less coarse material and is generally placed in the fork of sapling the birds often take little trouble to conceal it sometimes placing it close to woodland path and the passer becomes aware of its nearness by hearing the harsh anxious chatter of the parents the four eggs are blue like the robin the robin is in fact near relative of the thrushes and the relationship is shown not only by the shape of the body and the bill but by the spotted breast which the young robins assume with their ﬁrst plumage in the middle states this relationship seems to have been recognized the wood thrush is there commonly called the wood robin while the female is brooding the eggs the male may be heard day after day from some favorite perch not too near the nest the early morning and the late afternoon are the favorite times all the thrushes but on cloudy days or in the cool shades of deep woods they sing all day occasionally the song ceases several days some calamity has befallen the nest squirrel or some other marauder has robbed the pair and there are more outpourings of joy till with renewed courage they select some safer spot and build again in midsummer the thrushes become very silent occasionally we come upon group feeding in the cherry or viburnum bushes but few are seen after august and by november they are in the tropics only the nest ﬁlled with snow reminds us of the pair whose return in may we await with the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https scarlet the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https scarlet tanager in south america the tanagers form large family but they send to the more northern of our eastern states only one representative the scarlet tanager sight of this splendid bird properly therefore suggests the tropics the tanager is considered rare bird but it can always be found in suitable situations and in certain parts of the country is really common bird oak groves are the favorite resort of the bird and since it does not often visit our dooryards even in migration and since we people not often visit oak groves the sight of tanager remains most people rare and exhilarating experience the bird too is of rather sluggish disposition so that even if we visit the spot where pair are nesting they display only rather languid curiosity the used by both sexes is well worth learning by its means our attention is often attracted to pair which we should otherwise overlook it consists of two syllables resembling the sylla bles tschip tschurr uttered in hoarse voice the song of the male is such robin with cold might produce either because the tanager breeds generally at some distance from man or because he considers that his brilliant coloring will make up other deﬁciencies the bird has never far i know done much to win the affection of bird lovers they have enthusiastic praise his coat but little to say of his manners story which wilson tells of male tanager is however worthy exception to this statement wilson found young bird which had fallen out of the nest and having brought it home put it into cage with some orioles they altogether neglected the orphan and it refused to be fed by wilson the latter was about to return it to the woods when male appeared and tried to enter the cage finding this impossible he went off but returned with food and fed the young one three or four days at last he showed so unmistakably his desire the release of the young one that the owner set it free and the two ﬂew off rejoicing if this tanager was type of his kind the species need not fear the application of the proverb handsome is that handsome does tanagers arrive early in may and may then be easily observed the trees are not yet in full leaf occasionally in cold storms all birds seem to keep near the ground and on such occasions tanagers are sometimes seen feeding on the ground itself their splendid colors showing to wonderful advantage the female is very plain personage olive green above and greenish yellow below with dull brownish wings is combination of color that serves very well to keep her concealed among the leaves the nest is sometimes placed in orchard trees or even in low bushes but frequently in tall oaks it is loosely built of straw and twigs and contains by the end of may from three to four eggs of light greenish blue marked with brown and lilac the young are fed on insects gathered from the leaves by the end of the summer the male moults his bright red feathers and comes out in suit resembling that of the female but he keeps his black wings and tail the whole family clothed in these inconspicuous colors migrate southward and remain in the tropics till the following the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https rose breasted the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https grosbeak to see grosbeak the ﬁrst time gives student of birds almost the same feeling of exaltation the ﬁrst sight of scarlet tanager if one should hear in the shade trees about the house robin singing much faster and with richer voice than ever before and after patient search ﬁnd the twig where the bird was singing one ﬁrst thought would probably be some escaped cage bird from the tropics the head of the male grosbeak is black the tail and wings black and white but in the center of the white breast is triangle of pure rose carried in some individuals far down the breast when the bird ﬂies the white patches in the wings have peculiar effect like circle of white the large almost monstrous bill not only accounts the bird name but explains why he is put into the same family with the sparrows his nature too is eminently practical sparrow should be favorite food is the potato bug his mate lacks the black and rose but her beak betrays her she is not particularly interesting bird and does not even have the credit of excellence in household matters at any rate far building her nest is concerned it is made of few coarse twigs loosely laid together little platform through which the eggs sometimes show from below and from which one would think they must certainly fall off the nest is placed in bush or low tree and contains three or four greenish blue eggs thickly marked with red the young are out in july and though few grosbeak s are occasionally seen in september most of them have already left the tropics by the end of the summer the same joyous week of may which brings the thrushes bobolinks and orioles brings them back again just knowledge of the hoarse note of the tanager will often betray the presence of that splendid bird so an acquaintance with the sharp click like that of pair of shears which the grosbeaks make will often attract the student and reward him with sight of the beautiful rosy breast grosbeaks sing long time on one perch on the uppermost spray of the tree that other tropical sparrow the indigo bird loves to but like the tanager on some branch well inside the canopy of leaves in the ﬁrst weeks of may when birds of many species are mating two and sometimes three male grosbeaks may occasionally be seen pursuing each other their white wing bars and spots making showy contrast to the black the victor in the struggle then returns to the tree near the female and pours out song of unusual vigor and sweetness in may the grosbeak visits the blossoming fruit trees snipping off the petals and the undeveloped fruit suspicion has therefore fallen on him but it is now believed by the best authorities that this budding is not severe enough to injure the tree or the crop of fruit nor must we forget to throw into the other balance the result of his labors in the potato ﬁeld when the adult male grosbeak moults in summer the rose on the breast becomes duller and the black on the head and back is almost entirely replaced by brown like the tanager however he retains his black wings and tail and may thus be distinguished from the young the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https redst the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https redst ar t almost fourth of the birds usually seen by good observer in morning walk in may or june belong to family known warblers if they were really musical their name suggests people might know them better but even it is their colors are often so bright that the birds well repay one who takes the trouble to make their acquaintance perhaps the best known of the family is the yellow warbler not to be confused with the goldﬁnch from which the absence of the latter black cap wings and tail will distinguish it the whose loud is so common sound in dry woods in summer is another member of the warbler family the gayest of them all however in most parts of our country is the redstart his coal black head with bright orange patches at the shoulders and yellowish bands across the wings and tail suggest miniature oriole the redstart is splendid bit of color in cuba he is known according to chapman candelita the little torch black and orange is not uncommon combination of color among birds and never fails to be effective the redstart moreover makes the most of his color by keeping both wings and tail spread so that the yellow and orange is constantly displayed he ﬂits from one twig to another spreading his little yellow fan ﬂying out turning his black head and glowing shoulders toward one and continually uttering little song not much in itself and only full of meaning and association to the bird friends to whom it suggests leafy shade near brooks in the summer heat the name of the family to which the redstart belongs needs perhaps word of explanation it simply means that our warblers are related to family of european birds which have well earned their name since the family includes the nightingale and one or two other birds almost musical the name redstart too is english start coming from the word tail it was applied in england to bird with red tail and since our bird has bright color in the tail the name was transferred to it by the english settlers many of the warblers frequent the thick woods and are little noticed the redsta rt however often builds in the trees or shrubbery about the house particularly if brook or pool afford an abundance of insects in the crotch of sapling or on limb the female places pretty nest built of bark and soft materials the female resembles the male in the pattern of color but the black is replaced by gray and the orange by faint yellowish shade males only one year old resemble the female so closely that the sharp little song often seems to proceed from the bill of female in reality it is young male that is singing one not yet arrived at the full splendor of his future gay plumage the redstart is often victimized by the cowbird and one feels the imposition more keenly in its case than in that of almost any other bird we know that the big clumsy cowbird is being reared at the expense of whole family of these pretty warblers the redstart comes early in may and

feeding them by thrusting her long bill into their gaping mouths and pumping food into their throats the process has been described act the food thus administered to the young consists probably of insects when birds visit ﬂowers it is not only to gather honey but also to capture the smaller gatherers many charming stories have been told of the fearlessness of the it had often been observed that birds fed from ﬂowers held in the hand but it remained soule to make artiﬁcial ﬂowers and by ﬁlling them with sugar water to provide daily feast her neighbors though the birds are very irritable and pugnacious when wild frequently attacking each other with the shrill squeaks which are their only notes yet in captivity they prove very gentle and almost affectionate the has discovered another method of obtaining the sweet liquor which it loves the sapsucker or woodpecker is in the habit of drilling rows of small holes into the maples of the northern forests and sucking out the sap which ﬁlls these little wells many insects are attracted to the sweet ﬂuid and the also come uninvited guests to the feast so that while the woodpecker is drinking on one side of the tree butterﬂies bees

seeds and various kinds of fruit in hard winters they become very tame and if fed regularly come to the barnyard almost like poultry most people are only too familiar with this bird but not he looks in life then he is full of energy and spirit his pure white throat shows against the black of his head and his rich reddish brown wings are ready to carry him off with whirr that startles one one that we see alive we see thousand hanging bloody and bedraggled in the markets few people who become really acquainted with who see him sitting on stone wall calling his name or see his mate hurrying her little ones over the road into the blackberry vines will care to make another meal off his little body we must consider not only the wrong if we acknowledge it to be one done to the individual quail whose life has been taken but the danger that threatens his whole race the cheerful is already much rarer sound than it used to be and the bird has many other dangers to contend against besides the gun the greatest peril that besets quail in the north is the occasional midwinter blizzard followed by intense cold the quail at night huddle close together on the ground their tails touching and their heads pointing out in circle after great storm in recent winter the melting snow exposed circle of quail surprised and buried by the snow like the people of pompeii buried under the falling

they hear any danger approaching they keep close to the ground relying on their brown coloring to conceal them if the danger comes too near they are off in half dozen directions over walls and bushes

goldﬁnches they are always cheerful and affectionate keeping together the greater part of the year in larger or smaller ﬂocks which call to each other if separated by notes sweet those of canary in summer goldﬁnches ﬁnd an abundance of food in the seeds of many species of plants but in winter also many remain even in the northern states searching cheerfully among the dry weeds and grasses and uttering their sweet notes many people however not notice them at this season when winter comes the head and body of the males of this species of many others lose the bright black and yellow which marks them so distinctly in summer and are clothed in dull brownish shades about the ﬁrst of april one notices here and there in ﬂock male that shows few bright yellow feathers and by another month they have moulted their winter dress and are gay ever in the spring and early summer the goldﬁnches are extremely musical spending hours in uttering simple but pleasing song several males now engage in what seems to be musical contest ﬂying out from tree and circling about with set wings all the time keeping up continual strain when ﬂying through the air at considerable height they go in long curves and utter during each undulation three or four simple notes they seem constantly to have business in one part or other of the country the ﬂight and characteristic notes become common feature of the summer landscape though the goldﬁnches are here all winter they delay nesting till very much later than the other resident birds the chickadees have their ﬁrst brood already out in the world by the time the goldﬁnches determine on build ing the female is little body is often the case where the male is bright the pair generally build in july and choose some thick leafy tree often maple or poplar and there on limb at considerable height from the ground construct very neat nest deep and built of ﬁne materials and lined with down from plants like the thistle here ﬁve or six bluish white eggs are laid and when in another month the young goldﬁnches begin to ﬂy it is at once evident from their sharp insistent crying the calling of the young orioles is mark of late june so the notes of the young goldﬁnches become associated with august goldﬁnches are very fond of the seeds of many kinds of composite ﬂowers they bite holes in unripe dandelion heads and take out the seeds thistles are

striking neither bird can utter its most characteristic note without gesticulatio watch crow from car window when the caw is inaudible and the bowing and opening of the wings are all the more noticeable the motions which the jay makes when screaming are not so well known the sound generally comes from screen of leaves both birds are thieves and seem to relish their thieving life both can live on almost any food both are heartily hated by their neighbors in bird world the jay is more bitterly detested by the other birds than the crow he is himself suspicious and at the approach of hawk owl or man warns the woods by his cries besides the ordinary djay djay the loud scream so familiar in the autumn woods the jay has other cries note like wheelbarrow turning on an ungreased axle high scream exactly like the hawk and such variety of lesser notes that one never is surprised to ﬁnd that any unusual sound heard in the woods is produced by the blue jay though one of the noisiest of birds when pursuing an intruder the jay has learned to slip through the trees without sound and conceals its bright blue and white in remarkable way pair of jays may be nesting in some evergreen in our very garden and unless we happen to see the female slip into the tree we may remain entirely unaware of their presence the nest is roughly constructe d of twigs and roots and is placed in tree from six to twenty feet from the ground on lining of ﬁner roots are laid four or ﬁve brownish or greenish eggs spotted with yellowish brown the young are hatched by the middle or end of june the jay in spring is undoubtedly reprobate he can not resist the temptation to sneak through the trees and bushes and when he ﬁnds nest of eggs temporarily left by its owner to thrust his sharp bill through the shells even young birds are devoured in the autumn however the jay is hearty open fellow noisy and intent on acorns and chestnuts the woods ring with his loud screams he travels through them with his compa nions it is amusing at this season to observe them obtaining chestnuts favorite food they drive their powerful bills into nut and wrench it out of the burr then ﬂy off with it to convenient limb and hammer it open many jays spend the entire winter in the northern woods subsisting on nuts but the large numbers observed in the fall are evidence that many others are moving southward where food is more plenty jays and squirrels are curiously associated both live in the autumn and winter innocently enough on nuts and acorns both in spring poach on the eggs and young of birds one becomes fond of each of these rascals in spite of his undoubted villanies and is glad that though neither squirrel nor jay is protected by law and in some states both are constantly persecuted neither seems

bands of little birds which in winter visit the trees about the houses there are often three different species all of which ﬁnd their food on the trunks or large limbs of trees but by such different methods that study of their habits is not only interesting but also extremely instructive the little downy woodpecker like all its tribe hitches up the trunk or along the upper side of the limb using its stiff tail feathers support and holding on to the bark by its two pairs of sharp claws the nuthatch with short weak tail and toes arranged in all song birds three in front and one behind has the toes however spread so wide that it can climb head downward over under or around the limb least known of the three is the brown creeper it too has three toes in front and one behind but although not related to the woodpeckers it has developed stiff and pointed tail feathers it therefore clings to the bark in an upright position and it commonly begins at the bottom of the tree and works steadily upward often in spiral during the winter months the brown creeper probably visits every village street and every city park in the northern states but it is just the color of the weathered bark and moves close to it it escapes the notice of nearly every one if one learns to distingu ish the ﬁne wiry note and watches the tree from which it proceeds one sees the bird ﬂutter to the base of neighboring tree and begin again its steady ascent when two birds are together they sometimes indulge in very pretty ﬂight and tumble in the air like pigeons rule however the creeper is solitary and in this respect offers marked contrast to its companions and relatives the sociable chickadees and kinglets the eyes of creeper are so near the bark which it is inspecting that it is not strange that it ﬁnds food where we should look in vain it has besides very long curved bill which will reach into crevices in the bark and before the end of the winter it has undoubtedly stripped the trees of large proportion of the dormant insects and their eggs especially like the other winter birds it seems to have very regular beat visiting the same groups or rows of trees every day few birds are so strictly arboreal the creepers the writer has only once seen one alight on the ground when the bird ﬂew to little stream to bathe in the ice storms which occasionally clothe every trunk and limb with glassy covering the creeper has to conﬁne itself to the leeward side of the trees occasionally the creeper on account of its practice of beginning at the bottom of the trunk ﬂies to spot on the tree below the band of tarred paper which protects the shade trees from the visits of the canker moth on reaching the band the bird makes circuit of the trunk in vain attempt to ﬁnd passage it is better provided however than the wingless moths and when the circuit has been made short ﬂight carries it over in april the creeper leaves its winter quarters the north and joins many other species in the great spruce forests of northern new england and canada occasionally on warm mornings before its departure the male indulges in little song of the thinnest quality imaginable when the pair reach their northern home they hunt crevice under some great ﬂake of loose bark and there construct their nest the bark of trees therefore furnishes the creeper with cradle at birth and home the rest of its the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https butcher the project gutenberg ebook of title by author https butcher bird every one who observes the habits of birds soon notices with astonishment the regularity with which they return each summer to the same spots to breed this is perhaps not so strange in the case of breeding birds they may be so fastidious in their selectio n of food or of nesting site that only few places suit them or the spot where they bred one year may appeal to their affection and so be selected again it is less evident and more remarkable that birds that spend only the winter in our neighborhood often have well deﬁned home those that spend the summer every autumn about the ﬁrst of november if one looks carefully at the topmost twigs of the small trees that are scattered about the edges of some marsh the eye may ﬁnally catch perched on the very top the ﬁgure of plump gray bird with black wings and tail about the size of robin its tail often moves if the bird were balancing itself nearer view would show that its bill was stout and slightly hooked like hawk among song birds it is our largest regular winter visitor and will remain near the same spot till the end of march when it retires northward to breed the same trees serve year after year posts doubt the bird remembers where to ﬁnd the fattest mice and grasshoppers the butcher bird or shrike is one of the few birds that seem to have developed sense of humor i have seen it attack and drive off birds far larger than itself apparently out of simple mischief it often indulges in succession of strange noises some of which resemble the song of the catbird but the whole performance is interspersed with chuckles squeaks and harsh sounds or interrupted by grating cry so that it can make pretense to be called melodious it seems sometimes if the bird were simply amusing itself while you will regard the butcher bird fellow it is not till you ﬁnd near its post of observation mice or birds jammed into the crotches of twigs or discover thornbush decorated with grasshoppers and caterpillars that you recall certain unpleasant reports about its character when you ﬁnally see it dash into ﬂock of sparrows and hear their screech of terror or see it tear out its victim brains with that hooked bill you will understand its habit of sitting where it can survey its whole domain the hawks clutch their prey in their curved talons and then tear it with their beak the shrike claws are neither curved nor powerful so that it is evident that it wedges its victims into forked twigs or impales them on thorns so that it can then tear off portions to devour but why it so often leaves them uneaten the practice of thus displaying its wares has earned the bird its name has never been satisfactorily explained perhaps the bird means to return to them in times of scarcity but they are so often left uneaten that it seems probable that it has formed the habit of hunting and hanging up its game often with thought of eating it the butcher bird has often been persecuted the destruction of smaller birds it seems far wiser to protect it not only in order to preserve so interesting bird but because birds form so small per cent of its food in the spring and fall it lives very largely on insects and throughout the winter mice form large part of its diet there is always danger of

its voice and habits to attract attention and its activity and restlessness are so constant that we rarely catch sight of the bit of color which it possesses crown which the little king carries but if we train our ear so that it catches every ﬁne natural sound matter how triﬂing we become aware some crisp winter day of thin see see see often repeated from some hedge or group of orchard trees if we watch our eye will catch sight of one or two tiny creatures ﬂitting restlessly among the twigs keeping their wings in almost constant motion even when not actually ﬂying the general color of the bird is shade known in the books olivaceous but the effect outdoors and at distance is dark gray across the wings there are little whitish bars and over the head dark lines enclose the little crown yellow in the female orange in the male if we succeed in attracting the chickadees to our trees by tying up bones the kinglets often come in their company but their little bills are too weak to pick at the frozen gristle and they merely glean from the twigs and buds the little scale insects the eggs of moths and spiders all manner of minute objects are detected by their sharp eyes and seized by their skillful little bills and tongues at night the band retires to some thick evergreen hedge or grove ready the next morning to resume their busy rounds in april the male is moved to utter simple little song and by the end of the month the whole company move to the spruce forests of the north not to return to us until the next september in the northern states the wned kinglet is the only species that remains all winter but from virginia southward its cousin the kinglet is associated with it in summer strange to say the more southern winter species goes farther north than the breeding from northern maine to the frigid zone few years ago eggs or nest of either kinglet had been described but when they were at last discovered they proved dainty the little builders themselves the nest is globular with an entrance in the upper part it is placed in thick mass of spruce twigs and composed of hanging moss ornamented with bits of dead leaves and lined chieﬂy with feathers in such nest many nine eggs are often laid imagine the little brooding in this bower like some of the warbler family the kinglet does not let an insect escape though it should take wing before it could be seized the bird too has wings and darts out after its prey in winter it often hovers under the piazza roofs or the lintels of the barn door and while in the air picks off the eggs or chrysalids that have been hidden in the crevices occasionally one of the birds in its eagerness to seize some attractive morsel ﬂies sharply against windowpane doubt it is the part of thrifty householder to sweep out the insects from

gulls wheeling gracefully through the air with outstretched wings ﬂoating lightly on the water or sitting in long lines or compact masses on the bars or ﬂats which are exposed at low tide the harbors of all the northern seacoast cities are visited in winter by numbers of these birds constantly on the watch any bits of refuse which may be thrown from the wharfs or vessels or brought down by the tides or currents their long and powerful wings make the ﬂight of even so heavy bird sight beautiful to watch and the water looks deserted when the motion and color which the gulls furnish is absent but it is not to the eye alone that the birds appeal the ceaseless activity of the gulls in pursuit of ﬂoating refuse and their inordinate appetite make them invaluable scavengers without them the refuse dumped into the water would return at each tide to pollute the shore idea can be formed of the value of the service performed by the gulls till one sees the countless throngs which hover over the dumping grounds in the lower new york bay awaiting the arrival of the scows with the refuse from that city the buzzards and vultures are protected in all warm countries their services in devouring carrion so ought these scavengers of the northern seas to be guarded from persecution the adult herring gull in full plumage has pure white underparts head and tail but gray mantle it is termed is spread over the wings young birds however show many shades of brown and attain the white only after year or two the small elegantly built birds known along the seacoast mackerel gulls are not strictly gulls but terns they may be known by their forked tails and by their black caps it is they that hover screaming over the water constantly darting down to strike at ﬁsh gulls breed commonly along the

not hard to disturb their composure they come more easily than almost any other bird to the squeaking sound that bird students make to attract the attention of birds one ﬂuffy head after another pitches into the tree nearest the performer then by short stages the boldest comes nearer to the strange sight and sound often within arm length when their curiosity is appeased they return to their examination of the twigs and branches or if startled by sudden movement they dive into the nearest cover their positions when feeding on slend er twigs are extremely graceful and their agility

lisp of this hardy bird besides the notes heard so commonly in winter the chickadee has pensive and extremely gentle whistle which it utters while sitting motionless and oftener in spring than at other seasons though it may be heard in every month of the year it consists of two notes an exact interval apart and each accented it is often mistaken especially in early spring the song of the phœbe but it may be distinguished by its purity and sweetness it is easily imitated by whistling and the bird will often answer or even ﬂy toward the person whistling and survey him with astonishment it is generally believed by people who see the bird only in winter that the chickadees retire northward in spring it is true that they then longer frequent the yards and gardens but in the woods and retired orchards many pair have excavated some decaying birch or apple stump and after lining it warmly with moss and feathers provided amply the continuance of their race sometimes many nine eggs are laid in
