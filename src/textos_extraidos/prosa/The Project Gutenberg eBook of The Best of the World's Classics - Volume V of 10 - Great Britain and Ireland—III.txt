gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https thomas davies the actor who then kept bookseller shop in russell stree t covent garden told that johnson was very much his friend and came frequently to his house where he more than once invited to meet him but by some unlucky accident or other he was prevented from coming to us thomas davies was man of good understanding and talents with the advantage of liberal education tho somewhat pompous he was an entertaining companion and his literary performances have inconsiderable share of merit he was friendly and very hospitable man both he and his wife who has been celebrated her beauty tho upon the stage many years maintained uniform decency of character and johnson esteemed them and lived in easy an intimacy with them with any family which he used to visit davies recollected several of johnson remarkable sayings and was one of the best of the many imitators of his voice and manner while relating them he increased my impatience more and more to see the extraordinary man whose works i highly valued and whose conversation was reported to be so peculiarly excellent at last on monday the 16th of may when i was sitting in davies back parlor after having drunk tea with him and davies johnson unexpectedly came into the shop and davies having perceived him through the glass door in the room in which we were sitting advancing toward us he announced his awful approach to somewhat in the manner of an actor in the part of horatio when he addresses hamlet on the appearance of his father look my lord it comes i found that i had very perfect idea of johnson ﬁgure from the portrait of him painted by sir joshua reynolds soon after he had published his dictionary in the attitude of sitting in his easy chair in deep meditation which was the ﬁrst picture his friend did him which sir joshua very kindly presented to and from which an engraving has been made this work davies mentioned my name and respectfully introduced to him i was much agitated and recollecting his prejudice against the scotch of which i had heard much i said to davies tell where i came from from scotland cried davies roguis hly johnson said i i indeed come from scotland but i can not help it i am willing to ﬂatter myself that i meant this light pleasantry to soothe and conciliate him and not an humiliating abasement at the expense of my country but however that might be this speech was somewhat unlucky with that quickness of wit which he was so remarkable he seized the expression come from scotland which i used in the sense of being of that country and if i had said that i had come away from it or left it retorted that sir i ﬁnd is what very great many of your countrymen can not help this stroke stunned good deal and when he had sat down i felt myself not little embarrassed and apprehensive of what might come next he then addrest himself to davies what you think of garrick he has refused an order the play of miss williams because he knows the house will be full and that an order would be worth three shillings eager to take any opening to get into conversation with him i ventured to say oh sir i can not think mr garrick would grudge such triﬂe to you sir said he with stern look i have known david garrick longer than you have done and i know right you have to talk to on the subject perhaps i deserved this check it was rather presumptuous in an entire stranger to express any doubt of the justice of his animadversion upon his old acquaintance and pupil i now felt myself much mortiﬁed and began to think that the hope which i had long indulged of obtaining his acquaintance was blasted and in truth had not my ardor been uncommonly strong and my resolution uncommonly persevering so rough reception might have deterred forever from making any further attempts i was highly pleased with the extraordinary vigor of his conversation and regretted that i was drawn away from it by an engag ement at another place i had part of the evening been left alone with him and had ventured to make an observation now and then which he received very civilly so that i was satisﬁed that tho there was roughness in his manner there was in his disposition davies followed to the door and when i complained to him little of the hard blows which the great man had given 4 5 6 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https he kindly took upon him to console by saying be uneasy i can see he likes you very well few days afterward i called on davie s and asked him if he thought i might take the liberty of waiting on johnson at his chambers in the temple he said i certainly might and that johnson would take it compliment so on tuesday the 24th of may after having been enlivened by the witty sallies of messieurs thornton wilkes churchill and lloyd with whom i had passed the morning i boldly repaired to johnson his chambers were on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of 1 inner temple lane and i entered them with an impression given by the rev blair 2 of edinbur gh who had been introduced to him not long before and described his having found the giant in his den an expression which when i came to be pretty well acquainted with johnson i repeated to him and he was diverted at this picturesque account of himself blair had been presented to him by james fordyce at this time the controversy concerning the pieces published by james macphe rson translations of ossian was at its height johnson had all along denied their authenticity and what was still more provoking to their admirers maintained that they had merit the subject having been introduced by fordyce blair relying on the internal evidence of their antiquity asked johnson whether he thought any man of modern age could have written such poems johnson replied yes sir many men many women and many children johnson at this time did not know that blair had just published dissertation not only defending their authenticity but seriously ranking them with the poems of homer and virgil and when he was afterward informed of this circumstance he exprest some displeasure at fordyce having suggested the topic and said i am not sorry that they got thus much their pains sir it was like leading one to talk of book when the author is concealed behind the door he received very courteously but it must be confest that his apartment and furniture and morning dress were sufﬁciently uncouth his brown suit of clothes looked very rusty he had on little shriveled unpowdered wig which was too small his head his neck and the knees of his breeches were loose his black worsted stockings ill drawn up and he had pair of unbuckled shoes by way of slippers but all these slovenly particularities were forgotten the moment that he began to talk some gentlemen whom i not recollect were sitting with him and when they went away i also rose but he said to nay go sir said i i am afraid that i intrude upon you it is benevolent to allow to sit and hear you he seemed pleased with this compliment which i sincerely paid him and answered sir i am obliged to any man who visits ii johnson audience with george iii 3 in february 1767 there happened one of the most remarkable incidents of johnson life which gratiﬁed his monarchical enthusiasm and which he loved to relate with all its circumstances when requested by his friends this was his being honored by private conversation with his majesty in the library at the queen house he had frequently visited those splendid rooms and noble collection of books which he used to say was more numerous and curious than he supposed any person could have made in the time which the king had employed barnard the librarian took care that he should have every accommodation that could contribute to his ease and convenience while indulging his literary taste in that place so that he had here very agreeable resource at leisure hours his majesty having been informed of his occasional visits was pleased to signify desire that he should be told when johnson came next to the library accordingly the 7 8 9 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https time that johnson did come soon he was fairly engaged with the book on which while he sat by the ﬁre he seemed quite intent barnard stole round to the apartment where the king was and in obedience to his majesty commands mentioned that johnson was then in the library his majesty said that he was at leisure and would go to him upon which barnard took one of the candles that stood on the king table and lighted his majesty through suite of rooms till they came to private door into the library of which his majesty had the key being entered barnard stept forward hastily to johnson who was still in profound study and whispered him sir here is the king johnson started up and stood still his majesty approached him and at once was courteously easy his majesty began by observing that he understood he came sometimes to the library and then mentioned his having heard that the doctor had been lately at oxford and asked him if he was not fond of going thither to which johnson answered that he was indeed fond of going to oxford sometimes but was likewise glad to come back again the king then asked him what they were doing at oxford johnson answered he could not much commend their diligence but that in some respect they were mended they had put their press under better regulations and at that time were printing polybius he was then asked whether there were better librar ies at oxford or cambridge he answered he believed the bodleian was larger than any they had at cam bridge at the same time adding i hope whether we have more books or not than they have at cambridge we shall make good use of them they being asked whether or christ church library was the largest he answered library is the largest we have except the bodleian y said the king that is the public library his majesty inquired if he was then writing anything he answered he was not he had pretty well told the world what he knew and must now read to acquire more knowledge the king it should seem with view to urge him to rely on his own stores an original writer and to continue his labors then said i not think you borrow much from anybody johnson said he thought he had already done his part writer i should have thought so too said the king if you had not written so well johnson observed to upon this that man could have paid handsomer compliment and it was ﬁt king to pay it was decisive when asked by another friend at sir joshua reynolds whether he made any reply to this high compliment he answered sir when the king had said it it was to be so it was not to bandy civilities with my sovereign perhaps man who had spent his whole life in courts could have shown more nice and digniﬁed sense of true politeness than johnson did in this instance his majesty having observed to him that he supposed he must have read good deal johnson answered that he thought more than he read that he had read great deal in the early part of his life but having fallen into ill health he had not been able to read much compared with others instance he said he had not read much compared with warburton upon which the king said that he heard warburton was man of much general knowledge that you could scarce talk with him on any subject on which he was not qualiﬁed to speak and that his learning resembled garrick acting in its universality his majesty then talked of the controversy between warburton and lowth which he seemed to have read and asked johnson what he thought of it johnson answered warburton has the most general most scholastic learning lowth is the more correct scholar i not know which of them calls names best the king was pleased to say he was of the same opinion adding you not think then johnson that there was much argument in the case johnson said he did not think there was why truly said the king when once it comes to calling names ar gument is pretty well at an end his majesty then asked him what he thought of lord lyttelton history which was just then published johnson said he thought his style pretty good but that he had blamed henry the second rather too much why said the king they seldom these things by halves sir answered johnson not to kings but fearing to be 10 11 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https he proceeded to explain himself and immediately subjoined that those who spoke worse of kings than they deserved he could ﬁnd excuse but that he could more easily conceive how some one might speak better of them than they deserved without any ill intention kings had much in their power to give those who were favored by them would frequently from gratitude exaggerate their praises and this proceeded from good motive it was certainly excusable far error could be excusable the king then asked him what he thought of hill johnson answered that he was an ingenious man but had veracity and immediately mentioned an instanc of it an assertion of that writer that he had seen objects magniﬁed to much greater degree by using three or four microscopes at time than by using one now added johnson every one acquainted with microscopes knows that the more of them he looks through the less the object will appear why replied the king this is not only telling an untruth but telling it clumsily if that be the case every one who can look through microscope will be able to detect him i now said johnson to his friends when relating what had passed began to consider that i was depreciating this man in the estimation of his sovereign and thought it was time to say something that might be more favorable he added therefore that hill was notwithstanding very curious observer and if he would have been contented to tell the world more than he knew he might have been very considerable man and needed not to have recourse to such mean expedients to raise his reputation the king then talked of literary journals mentioned particularly the journal des savants and asked johnson if it was well done johnson said it was formerly very well done and gave some account of the persons who began it and carried it on some years enlar ging at the same time on the nature and use of such works the king asked him if it was well done now johnson answered he had reason to think that it was the king then asked him if there were any other literary journals published in this kingdom except the monthly and critical reviews and on being answered there was other his majesty asked which of them was the best johnson answered that the monthly review was done with most care the critical upon the best principles adding that the authors of the monthly review were enemies to the church this the king said he was sorry to hear the conversation next turned on the philosophical transactions when johnson observed that they had now better method of arranging their materials than formerly ay said the king they are obliged to johnson that his majesty had heard and remembered the circumstance which johnson himself had got his majesty exprest desire to have the literary biography of this country ably executed and proposed to johnson to undertake it johnson signiﬁed his readiness to comply with his majesty wishes during the whole of this interview johnson talked to his majesty with profound respect but still in his ﬁrm manly manner with sonorous voice and never in that subdued tone which is commonly used at the levee and in the room after the king withdrew johnson showed himself highly pleased with his majesty conversation and gracious behavior he said to barnard sir they may talk of the king they will but he is the ﬁnest gentleman that i have ever seen and he afterward observed to langton sir his manners are those of ﬁne gentleman we may suppose lewis the fourteenth or charles the second at sir joshua reynolds where circle of johnson friends were collected round him to hear his account of this memorable conversation joseph warton in his frank and lively manner was very active in pressing him to mention the particulars come now sir this is an interesting matter favor us with it johnson with great good humor complied 12 13 14 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https told them i found his majesty wished i should talk and i made it my business to talk i ﬁnd it does man good to be talked to by his sovereign in the ﬁrst place man can not be in here some question interrupted him which is to be regretted he certainly would have pointed out and illustrated many circumstances of advantage from being in situation where the powers of the mind are at once excited to vigorous exertion and tempered by reverential awe iii the meeting of johnson and john wilkes 4 i am now to record very curious incident in johnson life which fell under my own observation of which pars magna and which i am persuaded will with the minded be much to his credit my desire of being acquainted with celebrated men of every description had made much about the same time obtain an introduction to samuel johnson and to john wilkes esq two men more different could perhaps not be selected out of all mankind they had even attacked one another with some asperity in their writings yet i lived in habits of friendship with both i could fully relish the excellence of each i have ever delighted in that intellectual chemistry which can separate good qualities from evil in the same person my worthy booksellers and friends messieurs dilly in the poultry at whose hospitable and table i have seen greater number of literary men than at any other except that of sir joshua reynolds had invited to meet wilkes and some more gentlemen on wednesday may 15th pray said i let us have dr johnson what with wilkes not the world said edward dilly johnson would never forgive come said i if you let negotiate you i will be answerable that all shall go well dilly nay if you will take it upon you i am sure i shall be very happy to see them both here notwithstanding the high veneration which i entertained johnson i was sensible that he was sometimes little actuated by the spirit of contradiction and by means of that i hoped i should gain my point i was persuaded that if i had come upon him with direct proposal sir will you dine in company with jack wilkes he would have ﬂown into passion and would probably have answe red dine with jack wilkes sir i soon dine with jack ketch i therefore while we were sitting quietly by ourselves at his house in an evening took occasion to open my plan thus dilly sir sends his respectful compliments to you and would be happy if you would him the honor to dine with him on wednesday next along with i must soon go to scotland johnson sir i am obliged to mr dilly i will wait upon boswell provided sir i suppose that the company which he is to have is agreeable to you johnson what you mean sir what you take you think i am so ignorant of the world to imagine that i am to prescribe to gentleman what company he is to have at his table 15 16 17 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https i beg your pardon sir wishing to prevent you from meeting people whom you might not like perhaps he may have some of what he calls his patriotic friends with him johnson well sir and what then what care i his patriotic friends poh boswell i should not be surprized to ﬁnd jack wilkes there johnson and if jack wilkes should be there what is that to sir my dear friend let us have more of this i am sorry to be angry with you but really it is treating strangely to talk to if i could not meet any company whatever occasionally boswell pray give sir i meant well but you shall meet whoever comes thus i secured him and told dilly that he would ﬁnd him very well pleased to be one of his guests on the day appointed upon the wednesday i called on him about half an hour before dinner i often did when we were to dine out together to see that he was ready in time and to accompany him i found him buffeting his books upon former occasion covered with dust and making preparation going abroad how is this sir said i you recollect that you are to dine at mr dilly johnson sir i did not think of going to dilly it went out of my head i have ordered dinner at home with williams boswell but my dear sir you know you were engaged to dilly and i told him so he will expect you and will be much disappointed if you come johnson you must talk to williams about this here was sad dilemma i feared that what i was so conﬁdent i had secured would yet be frustrated he had accustomed himself to show williams such degree of humane attention frequently imposed some restraint upon him and i knew that if she should be obstinate he would not stir i hastened to the blind lady room and told her i was in great uneasiness johnson had engaged to to dine this day at dilly but that he had told he had forgotten his engagement and had ordered dinner at home yes sir said she pretty peevishly johnson is to dine at home madam said i his respect you is such that i know he will not leave you unless you absolutely desire it but you have so much of his company i hope you will be good enough to forego it day dilly is very worthy man has frequently had agreeable parties at his house johnson and will be vexed if the docto r neglects him and then madam be pleased to consider my situation i carried the message and i assured dilly that johnson was to come and doubt he has made dinner and invited company and boasted of the honor he expected to have i shall be quite disgraced if the doctor is not there she gradually softened to my solicitations which were certainly earnest most entreaties to ladies upon any occasion and was graciously pleased to empower to tell johnson that all things considered she thought he should certainly go i ﬂew back to him still in dust and careless of what should be the event indif ferent in his choice to go or stay but soon i had announced to him williams consent he roared frank clean shirt and was very soon drest when i had him fairly seated in with i exulted much who has got an heiress into with him to set out gretna green when we entered dilly he found himself in the midst of company he did not know i kept myself snug and silent watching how he would conduct himself i observed him whispering to dilly who is that gentleman sir arthur lee johnson too too too under his breath which was one of his habitual mutterings arthur lee could not but be very obnoxious to johnson he was not only patriot but an american he was afterward minister from the united states at the court of 18 19 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https and who is the gentleman in lace wilkes sir this information confounded him still more he had some difﬁculty to restrain himself and taking up book sat down upon and read or at least kept his eye upon it intently some time till he composed himself his feelings i dare say were awkward enough but he doubt recollected his having rated supposing that he could be at all disconcerted by any company and he therefore resolutely set himself to behav quite an easy man of the world who could adapt himself at once to the disposition and manners of those whom he might chance to meet the cheering sound of dinner is upon the table dissolved his reverie and we all sat down without any symptom of there were present besides wilkes and arthur lee who was an old companion of mine when he studied physics at edinbur gh now sir john miller lettson and slater the druggist wilkes placed himself next to johnson and behaved to him with so much attention and politeness that he gained upon him insensibly man ate more heartily than johnson or loved better what was nice and delicate wilkes was very assiduous in helping him to some ﬁne veal pray give leave is better little of the fat little of the have the pleasure of giving you some to recommend squeeze of this orange or the lemon perhaps may have more zest sir sir i am obliged to you sir cried johnson bowing and turning his head to him with look some time of surly virtue but in short while of complacency iv johnson y 5 tho porter was double the age of johnson and her person and manner described to by the late garrick were by means pleasing to others she must have had superiority of understanding and talents she certainly inspired him with more than ordinary passion and she having signiﬁed her willingness to accept of his hand he went to lichﬁeld to ask his mother consent to the marriage which he could not but be conscious was very imprudent scheme both on account of their disparity of years and her want of fortune but johnson knew too well the ardor of her son temper and was too tender parent to oppose his inclinations i know not what reason the marriage ceremony was not performed at birmingham but resolution was taken that it should be at derby which place the bride and bridegroom set out on horseback i suppose in very good humor but tho topham beauclerk used archly to mention johns on having told him with much gravity sir it was love marriage on both sides i have had from my illustrious friend the following curious account of their journey to church upon the nuptial morn 9th july sir she had read the old romances and had got into her head the fantastical notion that woman of spirit should use her lover like dog so sir at ﬁrst she told that i rode too fast and she could not keep up with and when i rode little slower she passed and complained that i lagged behind i was not to be made the slave of capri ce and i resolved to begin i meant to end i therefore pushed on briskly till i was fairly out of her sight the road lay between two hedges so i was sure she could not miss it and i contrived that she should soon come up with when she did i observed her to be in tears this it must be allowed was singula r beginning of connubial felicity but there is doubt that johnson tho he thus showed manly ﬁrmness proved most affectionate and indulgent husband to the last moment of johnson life and in his prayers and 20 21 22 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https we ﬁnd very remarkable evidence that his regard and fondnes s her never ceased even after her death footnotes from boswell life of johnson the author of the lectures on rhetoric who was born in 1718 and died in from boswell life of johnson from boswell life of johnson wilkes was the famous publicist and political agitator who was expelled from parliament imprisoned and outlawed but afterward elected lord mayor of london and allowed to sit in parliament many years from boswell life of johnson johnson was married in 1734 when his age was william wordswor th born in 1770 died in 1850 graduated from cambridge in 1791 traveled on the continent in settled at grasmere in 1799 married mary hutchinson in 1802 settled at rydal mount in 1813 traveled in scotland in 1814 and in 1832 traveled on the continent again in 1820 and in 1837 became poet laureate in 1843 published his ﬁrst volume in 1793 and his last the prelude in poet defined 6 taking up the subject upon general grounds i ask what is meant by the word poet what is poet to whom does he address himself and what language is to be expected from him he is man speaking to men man it is true endued with more lively sensibility more enthusiasm and tenderness who has greater knowledge of human nature and more comprehensive soul than are supposed to be common among mankind man pleased with his own passions and volitions and who rejoices more than other men in the spirit of life that is in him delighting to contemplate similar volitions and passions manifested in the goings on of the universe and habitually impelled to create them where he does not ﬁnd them to these qualities he has added disposition to be affected more than other men by absent things if they were present an ability of conjuring up in himself passions which are indeed far from being the same those produced by real events yet especially in those parts of the general sympathy which are pleasing and delightful more nearly resemble the passions produced by real events than anything which from the motions of their own minds merely other men are accustomed to feel in themselves whence and from practise he has acquired greater readiness and power in expressing what he thinks and feels and especially those thoughts and feelings which by his own choice or from the structure of his own mind arise in him without immediate external excitement but whatever portion of this faculty we may suppose even the greatest poet to possess there can not be doubt but that the language which it will suggest to him must in 1 2 3 4 5 23 24 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https and truth fall far short of that which is uttered by men in real life under the actual pressure of those passions certa in shadows of which the poet thus produces or feels to be produced in himself however exalted notion we would wish to cherish of the character of the poet it is obvious that while he describes and imitates passions his situation is altogether slavish and mechanical compared with the freedom and power of real and substantial action and suffering so that it will be the wish of the poet to bring his feelings near to those of the persons whose feelings he describes nay short spaces of time perhaps to let himself slip into an entire delusion and even confound and identify his own feelings with theirs modifying only the language which is thus suggested to him by consideration that he describes particular purpose that of giving pleasure here then he will apply the principle on which i have so much insisted namely that of selection on this he will depend removing what would other wise be painful or disgusting in the passion he will feel that there is necessity to trick out or elevate nature and the more industriously he applies this principle the deeper will be his faith that words which his fancy or imagination can suggest will bear to be compared with those which are the emanations of reality and truth but it may be said by those who not object to the general spirit of these remarks that it is impossible the poet to produce upon all occasions language exquisitely ﬁtted the passion that which the real passion itself suggests it is proper that he should consider himself in the situation of translator who deems himself justiﬁed when he substitutes excellences of anoth er kind those which are unattainable by him and endeavors occasionally to surpass his original in order to make some amends the general inferiority to which he feels that he must submit but this would be to encourage idleness and unmanly despair further it is the language of men who speak of what they not understand who talk of poetry of matter of amusement and idle pleasure who will converse with us gravely about taste poetry they express it if it were thing indifferent taste or frontignac or sherry aristotle i have been told hath said that poetry is the most philosophic of all writing it is so its object is truth not individual and local but general and operative not standing upon external testimony but carried alive into the heart by passion truth which is its own testimony which gives strength and divinity to the tribunal to which it appeals and receives them from the same tribunal poetry is the image of man and nature the obstacles which stand in the way of the ﬁdelity of the biographer and historian and of their conseque nt utility are incalculably greater than those which are to be encountered by the poet who has an adequate notion of the dignity of his art the poet writes under one restrict ion only namely that of the necessity of giving immediate pleasure to human being possest of that information which may be expected from him not lawyer physician mariner an astronomer or natural philosopher but man except this one restriction there is object standing between the poet and the image of things between this and the biographer and the historian there are thousand nor let this necessity of producing immediate pleasure be considered degradation of the poet art it is far otherwise it is an acknowledgment of the beauty of the universe an acknowledgment the more sincere because it is not formal but indirect it is task light and easy to him who looks at the world in the spirit of love further it is an homage paid to the native and naked dignity of man to the grand elementary principle of pleasure by which he knows and feels and lives and moves we have sympathy but what is propagated by pleasure i would not be misunderstood but wherever we sympathize with pain it will be found that the sympathy is produced and carried on by subtle combinations with pleasure we have knowledge that is general principles drawn from the contemplation of particu lar facts but what has been built up by pleasure and exists in us by pleasure alone the man of science the chemist and mathematician whatever difﬁculties and disgusts they may have had to struggle with know and feel this however painful may be the objects with which the anatomist knowledge is connected he feels that his knowledge is pleasure and where he has pleasure he has knowledge what then does the poet he considers man and the objects that surround 25 26 27 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https acting and reacting upon each other so to produce an inﬁnite comp lexity of pain and pleas ure he considers man in his own nature and in his ordinary life contemplating this with certain quantity of immediate knowledge with certain convictions intuitions and deductions which by habit become of the nature of intuitions he considers him looking upon this complex scene of ideas and sensations and ﬁnding everywhere objects that immediately excite in him sympathies which from the necessities of his nature are accompanied by an overbalance of enjoyment to this knowledge which all men carry about with them and to these symp athies in which without any other discipline than that of our daily life we are ﬁtted to take delight the poet principally directs his attention he considers man and nature essentially adapted to each other and the mind of man naturally the mirror of the fairest and most interesting qualities of nature and thus the poet prompted by this feeling of pleasure which accompanies him through the whole course of his studies converses with general nature with affections akin to those which through labor and length of time the man of science has raised up in himself by conversing with those parts of nature which are the objects of his studies the knowledge both of the poet and the man of science is pleasure but the knowledge of the one cleaves to us necessary part of our existence our natural and unalienable inheritance the other is personal and individual acquisition slow to come to us and by habitual and direct sympathy connecting us with our fellow beings the man of science seeks truth remote and unknown benefactor he cherishes and loves it in his solitude the poet singing song in which all human beings join with him rejoices in the presence of truth our visible friend and hourly companion poetry is the breath and ﬁner spirit of all knowledge it is the impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all science emphatically may be said of the poet shakespeare hath said of man that he looks before and after he is the rock of defense of human nature an upholder and preserver carrying everywhere with him relationship and love in spite of difference of soil and climate of language and manners of laws and customs in spite of things silently gone out of mind and things violently destroyed the poet binds toget her by passion and knowledge the vast empire of human society it is spread over the whole earth and over all time the objects of the poet thoughts are everywhere tho the eyes and senses of man are it is true his favorite guides yet he will follow wheresoever he can ﬁnd an atmosphere of sensation in which to move his wings poetry is the ﬁrst and last of all is immortal the heart of man if the labors of men of science should ever create any material revolution direct or indirect in our condition and in the impressions which we habitually receive the poet will sleep then more than at present but he will be ready to follow the steps of the man of science not only in those general indirect effects but he will be at his side carrying sensation into the midst of the science itself the remotest discoveri es of the chemist the botanist or mineral ogist will be proper objects of the poet art any upon which it can be employed if the time should ever come when these things shall be familiar to us and the relations under which they are contemplated by the followers of these respective sciences shall be manif estly and palpably material to us enjoying and suffering beings if the time should ever come when what is now called science thus familiarized to men shall be ready to put on it were form of ﬂesh and blood the poet will lend his divine spirit to aid the transﬁguration and will welcome the being thus produced dear and genuine inmate of the household of man it is not then to be supposed that any one who holds that sublime notion of poetry which i have attempted to convey will break in upon the sanctity and truth of his pictures by transitory and accidental ornaments and endeavor to excite admiration of himself by arts the necessity of which must manifestly depend upon the assumed meanness of his subject

surprize her with their homage and that the poor player overcome with awe at her presence had either forgot the part assigned her or lacked courage to go through it it was natural and courteous to

70 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https does tune f avor fools 15 does fortune favor fools or how you explain the origin of the proverb which differently worded is to be found in all the languages of europe this proverb admits of various explanat ions according to the moods of mind in which it is used it may arise from pity and the soothing persuasion that providence is eminently watchful over the helpless and extends an especial care to those who are not capable of caring themselves so used it breathes the same feeling god tempers the wind to the shorn lamb the more sportive adage that the fairies take care of children and tipsy folk the persuasion itself in addition to the general religious feeling of mankind and the scarcely less general love of the marvelous may be accounted from our tendency to exaggerate all effects that seem disproportionate to their visible cause and all circumstances that are in any way strongly contrasted with our notions of the persons under them secondly it arises from the safety and success which an ignorance of danger and difﬁculty sometimes actually assists in procuring inasmuch it precludes the despondence which might have kept the more foresighted from undertaking the enterprise the depression which would retard its progress and those overwhelming inﬂuences of terror in cases where the vivid perception of the danger constitutes the greater part of the danger itself thus men are said to have swooned and even died at the sight of narrow bridge over which they had ridden the night before in perfect safety or at tracing the footmarks along the edge of precipice which the darkness had concealed from them more obscure cause yet not wholly to be omitted is afforded by the undoubted fact that the exertion of the reasoning faculties tends to extinguish or bedim those mysterious instincts of skill which tho the most part latent we nevertheless possess in common with other animals or the proverb may be used invidiously and folly in the vocabulary of envy or baseness may signify courage and magnanimity hardihood and foolhardiness are indeed different green and yellow yet will appear the same to the jaundiced eye courage multiplies the chances of success by sometimes making oppo rtunities and always availing itself of them and in this sense fortune may be said to favor fools by those who however prudent in their own opinion are deﬁcient in valor and enterprise again an eminently good and wise man whom the praises of the judicious have procured high reputation even with the world at large proposes to himself certain objects and adapting the right means to the right end attains them but his objects not being what the world calls fortune neither money nor artiﬁcial rank his admitted inferiors in moral and intellectual worth but more prosperous in their worldly concerns are said to have been favored by fortune and be slighted altho the fools did the same in their line the wise man in his they adapted the appropriate means to the desired end and so succeeded in this sense the proverb is current by misuse or catachresis at least of both the words fortune and fools how seldom friend good great man inherits honor or wealth with all his worth and pains it sounds like stories from the land of spirits if any man obtain that which he

there is doubtless true meaning attached to fortune distinct both from prudence and from courage and distinct too from that absence of depressing or bewildering passions which according to my favorite proverb extremes meet the fool not seldom obtains in great perfection by his ignorance the wise man by the highest energies of thought and luck has real existence in human affairs from the inﬁnite number of powers that are in action at the same time and from the coexistence of things contingent and accidental such to us at least are accide ntal with the regular appearances and general laws of nature familiar instance will make these words intelligible the moon waxes and wanes according to necessary law the clouds likewise and all the manifold appearances connected with them are governed by certain laws less than the phases of the moon but the laws which determine the latter are known and calculable while those of the former are hidden from us at all events the number and variety of their effects bafﬂe our powers of calculation and that the sky is clear or obscured at any particular time we speak of in common language matter of accident well at the time of the full moon but when the sky is completely covered with black clouds i am walking on in the dark aware of particular danger sudden gust of wind rends the clouds moment and the moon emer ging discloses to chasm or precipice to the very brink of which i had advanced my foot this is what is meant by luck and according to the more or less serious mood or habit of our mind we exclaim how lucky or how provident ial the copresence of numberless phenomena which from the complexity or subtlety of their determining causes are called contingencies and the coexistence of these with any regular or necessary phenomenon the clouds with the moon instan ce occasion coincidences which when they are attended by any advantage or injury and are at the same time incapable of being calculated or foreseen by human prudence form good or ill luck on hot sunshiny afternoon came on sudden storm and spoiled the farmer hay and this is called ill luck we will suppose the same event to take place when meteorology shall have been perfected into science provided with unerring instruments but which the farmer had neglected to examine this is longer ill luck but imprudence now apply this to our proverb unforeseen coincidences may have greatly helped man yet if they have done him only what possibly from his own abilities he might have effected himself his good luck will excite less attention and the instances be less remembered that clever men should attain their objects seems natural and we neglect the circumstances that perhaps produced that success of themselves without the intervention of skill or foresight but we dwell on the fact and remember it something strange when the same happens to weak or ignorant man so too tho the latter should fail in his undertakings from concurrences that might have happened to the wisest man yet his failure being more than migh t have been expected and accounted from his folly it lays hold on our attention but ﬂeets away among the other undistinguished

different classes of people in state in such cases there is hardship but in the long run the matter is fully compensated to the overtaxed class example take the householders in london who complain so

order to cherish manufactures of its own and thereby forces the carolinas another state of itself with which there is little which has such desire or interest to serve to buy worse articles at higher

momentarily within his breast that human care could avail him insisted that the surgeon should leave him and attend to those to whom he might be useful said he you can nothing all that could be done was to fan him with paper and frequently to give him lemonade to alleviate his intense thirst he was in great pain and exprest much anxiety the event of the action which now began to decla re itself often ship struck the crew of the victory hurrahed and at every hurrah visible expres sion of joy gleamed in the eyes and marked the countenance of the dying hero but he became impatient to see hardy and that ofﬁcer tho often sent could not leave the deck nelson feared that some fatal cause prevented him and repeatedly cried will one bring hardy to he must be killed he is surely dead an hour and ten minutes elapsed from the time when nelson received his wound before hardy could come to him they shook hands in silence hardy in vain struggling to suppress the feelings of that most painful and yet sublimest moment well hardy said nelson how goes the day with us very well replied hardy ten ships have struck but ﬁve of the van have tacked and show an intention to bear down upon the victory i have called two or three of our fresh ships round and have doubt of giving them drubbing i hope said nelson none of our ships have struck hardy answered there was fear of that then and not till then nelson spoke of himself i am dead man hardy said he i am going fast it will be all over with soon come nearer to let my dear lady hamilton have my hair and all other things belonging to hardy observed that he hoped beatty could yet hold out some prospect of life he replied it is impossible my back is shot through beatty will tell you so hardy then once more shook hands with him and with heart almost bursting hastened upon deck by this time all feeling below the breast was gone and nelson having made the surgeon ascertain this said to him you know i am gone i know it i feel something rising in my breast putting his hand on his left side which tells so and upon beatty inquiring whether his pain was very great he replied so great that he wished he was dead yet said he in lower voice one would like to live little longer too and after few minutes in the same undertone he added what would become of poor lady hamilton if she knew my situation next to his country she occupied his thoughts captain hardy some ﬁfty minutes after he had left the cockpit returned and again taking the hand of his dying friend and commander congra tulated him on having gained complete victory how many of the enemy were taken he did not know it was impossible to perceive them distinctly but fourteen or ﬁftee n at least that well cried nelson but i bargained twenty and then in stronger voice he said anchor hardy anchor hardy upon this hinted that admiral collingwood would take upon himself the direction of affairs not while i live hardy said the dying nelson ineffectually endeavoring to raise himself from the bed you anchor his previous orders preparing to anchor had shown clearly he foresaw the necessity of this presently calling hardy back he said to him in low voice throw overboard and he desired that he might be buried by his parents unless it should please the king to order otherwise then reverting to private feelings take care of my dear lady hamilton hardy take care of poor lady hamilton kiss hardy said he hardy knelt down and kissed his cheek and nelson said now i am satisﬁed thank god i have done my duty hardy stood over him in silence moment or two then knelt again and kissed his forehead who is that said nelson and being informed he replied god bless you hardy and hardy then 82 83 84 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great

have not been great sinner and after short pause remember that i leave lady hamilton and my daughter horatia legacy to my country his articulation now became difﬁcult but he was distinctly heard to say thank god i have done my duty these words he repeatedly pronounced and they were the last words which he uttered he expired at thirty minutes after ree hours and quarter after he had received his

admiration and affection of our pride and of our hopes was suddenly taken from us and it seemed if we had never till then known how deeply we loved and reverenced him what the country had lost in its great naval greatest of our own and of all former scarcely taken into the account of grief so perfectly indeed had he performed his part that the maritime war after the battle of trafalgar was considered at an end the ﬂeets of the enemy were not merely defeated but destroyed new navies must be built and new race of seamen reared them before the possibility of their invading our shores could again be contemplated it was not therefore from any selﬁsh reﬂection upon the magnitude of our loss that we mourned him the general sorrow was of higher character the people of england grieved that

by which all the maritime schemes of france were totally frustrate d hardly appeared to add to our security or strength while nelson was living to watch the combined squadrons of the enemy we felt ourselves secure now when they were longer in existence there was reason to suppose from the appearances upon opening his body that in the course of nature he might have attained like his father to good old age yet he can not be said to have fallen prematurely whose work was done nor ought he to be lamented who died so full of honors and at the height of human fame the most triumphant death is that of the martyr the most awful that of the martyred patriot the most splendid that of the hero in the hour of victory and if the chariot and the horses of ﬁre had been vouchsafed nelson translation he could scarcely have departed in brighter blaze of glory he has left us not indeed his mantle of inspiration but name and an example which are at this hour inspiring thousands of the youth of name

be seen fairly carved out in wood upon the of the great hall the whole story down to the robin till foolish rich uncle pulled it down to set up marble one of modern invention in its stead with story upon it here alice put out one of her dear mother looks too tender to be called upbraiding then i went on to say how religious and how good their field was how beloved and respected by everybo dy tho

stript and carried away to the owner other house where they were set up and looked awkward if some one were to carry away the old tombs they had seen lately at the abbey and stick them up in lady tawdry gilt here john smiled much to say that would be foolish indeed and then i told how when she came to die her funeral was attended by concourse of all the poor and some of the gentry too of the neighborhood many miles round to show their respect her memory because she had been such good and religious woman so good indeed that she knew all the psaltery by heart ay and great part of the

good spirits or make them stoop but they were still upright because she was so good and religious then i told how she was used to sleep by herself in lone chamber of the great lone house and how she believed that an apparition of two infants was to be seen at midnight gliding up and down the great staircase near where she slept but she said those innocents would her harm and how frightened i used to be tho in those days i had my maid to sleep with because i was never half so good or religious yet i never saw the infants here john expanded all his eyebrows and tried to look courageous then i told how good she was to all her grandchildren having us to the great house in the holidays where i in particular used to spend many hours by myself in gazing upon the old busts of the twelve cæsars that had been emperors of rome till the old marble heads would seem to live again or i to be turned into marble with them how i never could be tired with roaming about that huge mansion with its vast empty rooms with their out hangings ﬂuttering tapestry and carved oaken panels with the gilding almost rubbed in the spacious gardens which i had almost to myself unless when now and then solitary

had meditated dividing with her and both seemed willing to relinquish them the present irrelevant then in somewhat more heightened tone i told how tho their grandmother field loved all her grandc

like some of us he would mount the most mettlesome horse he could get when but an imp bigger than themselves and make it carry him half over the county in morning and join the hunters when there were any out and yet he loved the old great house and gardens too but had too much spirit to be always pent up within their boundaries and how their uncle grew up to man estate brave he was handsome to the

death and how i bore his death i thought pretty well at ﬁrst but afterward it haunted and haunted and tho i did not cry or take it to heart some and i think he would have done if i had died yet i missed him all day long and knew not till then how much i had loved him i missed his kindness and i missed his crossness and wished him to be alive again to be quarreling with we quarreled than not have him again and was uneasy without him he their poor uncle must have been when the doctor took off his limb here the children fell and asked if their little mourning which they had on was not uncle john and they looked up and prayed not to go on about their uncle but to tell them some stories about their pretty dead mother then i told how seven long years in hope sometimes sometimes in despair yet persistin g ever i courted the fair alice and much children could understand i explained to them what coyness and difﬁculty and denial meant in maidens when suddenly turning to alice the soul of the ﬁrst alice looked out at her eyes with such reality of representment that i became in doubt which of them stood there before or whose that bright hair was and while i stood gazing both the

we hold the good hours of the dawn too sacred to waste them upon such observances which have in them besides something pagan and persic to say truth we never anticipated our usual hour or got up with the sun is called to go journey or upon foolish whole day pleasuring but we suffered it all the long hours after in listlessness and headaches nature herself sufﬁciently declaring her sense of our presumption in aspiring to regulate our frail waking courses by the measures of that celestial and sleepless traveler we deny not that there is something sprig htly and vigorous at the outset especially in these excursions it is ﬂattering to get the start of lazy world to conquer death by proxy in his image but the seeds of sleep and mortality are in us and we pay usually in strange qualms before night falls the penalty of the unnatural inversion therefore while the busy part of mankind are fast huddling on their clothes or are already up and about their occupations content to have swallowed their sleep by wholesale we choose to linger abed and digest our dreams it is the very time to recombine the wandering images which night in confused mass presented to snatch them from forgetfulness to shape and mold them some people have good of their dreams like fast feeders they gulp them too grossly to taste them curiously we love to chew the cud of foregone vision to collect the scattered rays of brighter phantasm or act over again with ﬁrmer nerves the sadder nocturnal tragedies to drag into daylight struggling and nightmare to handle and examine the terrors or the airy solaces we have too much respect these spiritual communications to let them go so lightly we are not so stupid or so careless that imperial forgetter of his dreams that we should need seer to remind us of the form of them they seem to us to have much signiﬁcance our waking concerns or rather to import us more nearly more nearly we approach by years to the shadowy world whither we are hastening we have shaken hands with the world business we have done with it we have dischar ged ourselves of it why should we get up we have neither suit to solicit nor affairs to manage the drama has shut in upon us at the fourth act we have nothing here to expect but in short time and dismissal we delight to anticipate death by such shadows night affords we are already half acquainted with ghosts we were never much in the world disappointment early struck dark veil between us and its dazzling illusions our spirits showed gray before our hairs the mighty changes of the world already appear but the vain stuff out of which dramas are composed we have asked more of life than what the mimic images in playhouses present us with even those types have waxed fainter our clock appears to have struck we are superannuated in this dearth of mundane satisfaction we contract politic alliances with shadows it is good to have friends at court the abstracted media of dreams seem ill introduction to that spiritual presence upon which in long time we expect to be thrown we are trying to know little of the usages of that colony to learn the language and the faces we shall meet with there that we may be the less awkward at our ﬁrst coming among them we willingly call fantom our fellow knowing we shall soon be of their dark companionship therefore we cherish dreams we try to spell in them the alphabet of the invisible world and think we know already how it shall be with us those uncouth shapes which while we clung to ﬂesh and blood affrighted us have become familiar we feel attached into their meager essences and have given the hand of approach to incorporeal being we once thought life to be something but it has unaccountably fallen from us before its time therefore we choose to dally with visions the sun has purposes of ours to light us to why should we get up 109 110 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https from the essays of

afterward quarreled owing to differing political views and his own peculiar temper his writings mainly essays and criticisms wrote also notable life of napoleon published in hamlet 25 it is the one of shakespeare plays that we think of the oftenest because it sounds most in striking reﬂections on human life and because the distresses of hamlet are transferred by the turn of his mind to the general account of humanity whatever happens to him we apply to ourselves because he applies it to himself means of general reasoning he is great moralizer and what makes him worth attending to is that he moralizes on his own feelings and experience he is not commonplace pedant if lear is distinguished by the greatest depth of passion hamlet is the most remarkable the ingenuity originality and unstudied development of character shakespeare had more magnanimity than any other poet and he has shown more of it in this play than in any other there is attempt to force an interest everything is left time and circumstances to unfold the attention is excited without effort the incidents succeed each other matters of course the characters think and speak and act just they might if left entirely to themselves there is set purpose straining at point the observations are suggested by the passing gusts of passion come and go like sounds of music borne on the wind the whole play is an exact transcript of what might be supposed to have taken place at the court of denmark at the remote period of time ﬁxt upon before the modern reﬁnements in morals and manners were heard of it would have been interesting enough to have been admitted bystander in such scene at such time to have heard and witnessed something of what was going on but here we are more than spectators we have not only the outward pageants and the signs of grief but we have that within which passes show we read the thoughts of the heart we catch the passions living they rise other dramatic writers give us very ﬁne versions and paraphrases of nature but shakespeare together with his own comments gives us the original text that we may judge ourselves this is very great advantage the character of hamlet stands quite by itself it is not character marked by strength of will or even of passion but by reﬁnement of thought and sentiment hamlet is little of the hero man can well be but he is young and princely novice full of high enthusiasm and quick sport of circumstances questioning with fortune and reﬁning on his own feelings and forced from the natural bias of his disposition by the strangeness of his situation he seems incapable of deliberate action and is only 21 22 23 24 111 112 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https into extremities

his death at other times when he is most bound to act he remains puzzled undecided and skeptical dallies with his purposes till the occasion is lost and ﬁnds out some pretense to relapse into indolence and thoughtfulness again this reason he refuses to kill the king when he is at his prayers and by reﬁnement in malice which is in truth only an excuse his own want of resolution defers his revenge to more fatal opportunity the moral perfection of this character has been called in question we think by those who did not understand it it is more interesting than according to rules amiable tho not faultless the ethical delineations of that noble and liberal casuist shakespeare has been well not exhibit the quakerism of morality his plays are not copied either from the whole duty of man or from the academy of compliments we confess we are little shocked at the want of reﬁnement in those who are shocked at the want of reﬁnement in hamlet the neglect of punctilious exactness in his behavior either partakes of the license of the time or else belongs to the very excess of intellectual reﬁnement in the characte r which makes the common rules of life well his own purposes sit loose upon him he may be said to be amenable only to the tribunal of his own thoughts and is too much taken up with the airy world of contemplation to lay much stress he ought on the practical consequences of things his habitual principles of action are unhinged and out of joint with the time his conduct to ophelia is quite natural in his circumstances it is that of assumed severity only it is the effect of disappointed hope of bitter regrets of affection suspended not obliterated by the distractions of the scene around him amidst the natural and preternatural horrors of his situation he might be excused in delicacy from carrying on regular courtship when his father spirit was in arms it was not time the son to make love in he could neither marry ophelia nor wound her mind by explaining the cause of his alienation which he durst hardly trust himself to think of it would have taken him years to have come to direct explanation on the point in the harassed state of his mind he could not

chinese manners and modes of life and scenery i should go mad the causes of my horror lie deep and some of them must be common to others southern asia in general is the seat of awful images and associations the cradle of the human race it would have dim and reverenti al feeling connected with it but there are other reasons man can pretend that the wild barbarous and capricious superstitions of africa or of savage tribes elsewhere affect in the way that he is affected by the ancient monumental cruel and elaborate religions of hindustan etc the mere antiquity of asiatic things of their

englishmen tho not bred in any knowledge of such institutions can not but shudder at the mystic sublimity of castes that have ﬂowed apart and refused to mix through such immemorial tracts of time nor

with human life the great ofﬁcina gentium man is weed in those regions the vast empires also into which the enormous population of asia has always been cast give further sublimity to the feelings

abhorrence and want of sympathy placed between us by feelings deeper than i can analyze i could sooner live with lunatics or brute animals all this and much more than i can say or have time to say the

was so awful to and at the same time so pathetic this abrupt translation from the darkness of the inﬁnite to the gaudy summer air of highest noon and from the unutterable abortions of eated gigantic vermin to the sight of infancy and innocent human natures june 1819 have had occasion to remark at various periods of my life that the deaths of those whom we love and indeed the contemplation of death generally is cœteris paribus more affecting in summer than in any other season of the year and the reasons are these three i think ﬁrst that the visible heavens in summer appear far higher more distant and if such solecism may be excused more inﬁnite the clouds by which chieﬂy the eye expounds the distance of the blue pavilion stretched over our heads are in summer more voluminous more massed and are accumulated in far grander and more towering piles secondly the light and the appearances of the declining and the setting sun are much more ﬁtted to be types and characters of the inﬁnite and thirdly which is the main reason the exuberant and riotous prodigality of life naturally forces the mind more powerfully upon the antagonist thought of death and the wintry sterility of the grave it may be observed generally that wherever two thoughts stand related to each other by law of antagonism and exist it were by mutual repulsion they are apt to suggest each other on these accounts it is that i ﬁnd it impossible to banish the thought of death when i am walking alone in the endless days of summer and any particular death if not actually more affecting at least haunts my mind more obstinately and besiegingly in that season perhaps this cause and slight incident which i omit might have been the immediate occasions of the following dream to which however predisposition must always have existed in my mind but having been once roused it never left and split into thousand fantastic variations which often suddenly recombined locked back into startling unity and restored the original dream i thought that it was sunday morning in may that it was easter sunday and yet very early in the morning i was standing it seemed to at the door of my own cottage right before lay the very scene which could really be commanded from that situation but exalted was usual and solemnized by the power of dreams there were the same mountains and the same lovely valley at their feet but the mountains were raised to more than alpine height and there was interspace far larger between them of savannahs and forest lawns the hedges were rich with white roses and living creature was to be seen excepting that in the green churchyard there were cattle tranquilly reposing upon the verdant graves and particularly round about the grave of child whom i had once tenderly loved just i had really beheld them little before sunrise in the same summer when that child died i gazed upon the scene and i said to myself it yet wants much of sunrise and it is easter sunday and that is the day on which they celebrate the of resurrection i will walk abroad old griefs shall be forgotten the air is cool and still and the hills are high and stretch away to heaven and the churchyard is verdant the forest lawns and the forest lawns are quiet the churchyard and with the dew i can wash the fever from my forehead and then i shall be unhappy longer i turned if to open my garden gate and immediately i saw upon the left scene far different but whic h yet the power of dreams had recon ciled into harmony the scene was an oriental one and there also it was easter sunday and very early in the morning and at vast distance were visible stain upon the horizon the domes and cupolas of great image or faint abstraction caught perhaps in childhood from some picture of jerusalem and not from upon stone shaded by judean palms there sat woman and i looked and it she ﬁxt her eyes upon earnestly and i said to her at length so then i have found you at last i waited but she answered not word her face was the same when i saw it last the same and yet again how different seventeen years ago when the of mighty 119 120 121 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great

yet again sometimes not altered and hardly older her looks were tranquil but with unusual solemnity of expression and i now gazed upon her with some awe suddenly her countena nce grew dim and turning to the mountains i perceived vapors rolling between us in moment all had vanished thick darkness came on and in the twinkling of an eye i was far away from mountains and by in london walking again with we had walked when both children eighteen years before along the endless terraces at oxford street then suddenly would come dream of far different tumultuous commencing with music such now i often heard in of prepar ation and of awakening suspense the undulations of tumults were like the opening of the coronation anthem and like that gave the feeling of multitudinous movement of inﬁnite cavalcades ﬁling off and the tread of innumerable armies the morning was come of mighty day of crisis and an ultimate hope human nature then suffering mysterious eclipse and laboring in some dread extremity somewhere but i knew not but i knew not some beings but i knew not by battle strife an agony was traveling through all its evolving itself like the catastrophe of some mighty drama with which my sympathy was the more insupportable from deepening confusion to its local scene its cause its nature and its undecipherable issue i is usual in dreams where of necessity we make ourselves central to every movement had the power and yet had not the power to decide it i had the power if i could raise myself to will it and yet again had not the power the weight of twenty atlantics was upon or the oppression of inexpiable guilt deeper than ever plummet sounded i lay inactive then like chorus the passion deepened some greater interest was at stake some mightier cause than ever yet the sword had pleaded or trumpet had proclaimed then came sudden alarms hurryings to and fro trepidations of innumerable fugitives i knew not whether from the good cause or the bad darkness and lights

farewells and with sigh such the caves of hell sighed when the incestuou s mother uttered the abhorred name of death the sound was farewells and again and yet again farewells and i awoke in struggles

to the world they are not interesting they attract by means of their repulsion not tho it could separately furnish reason loving book that the majority of men had found it repulsive prima facie it must suggest some presumption against book that it has failed to gain public attention to have roused hostility indeed to have kindled feud against its own principles or its temper may happen to be good sign that argues power hatred may be promising the deepest revolutions of minds sometimes begin in hatred but simply to have left reader unimprest is in itself neutral result from which the inference is doubtful yet even that even simple failure to impress may happen at times to be result from positive powers in writer from special originalities such rarely reﬂect themselves in the mirror of the ordinary understanding it seems little to be perceived how much the great scriptural idea of the worldly and the unworldly is found to emer ge in literature well in life in reality the

in the realities of life charles lamb if any ever was is amongst the class here contemplated he if any ever has ranks amongst writers whose works are destined to be forever unpopular and yet forever

continue to command select audience in every generation the prose essays under the signature of elia form the most delightful section amongst lamb works they traverse peculiar ﬁeld of observation sequestered from general interest and they are composed in spirit too delicate and unobtrusive to catch the ear of the noisy crowd clamoring strong sensations but this retiring delicacy itself the pensiveness checkered by gleams of the fanciful and the humor that is touched with of pathos together with the picturesque quaintness of the objects casually descri bed whether men or things or usages and in the rear of all this the constant recurrence to ancient recollections and to decaying forms of household life things retiring before the tumult of new and revolutionary generations these traits in combination communicate to the papers grace and strength of originality which nothing in any literature approaches whether degree or kind of excellence except the most felicitous papers of addison such those on sir roger coverley and some others in the same vein of compos ition they resemble addison papers also in the diction which is natural and idiomatic even to carelessness they are equally faithful to the truth of nature and in this only they differ the sketches of elia reﬂect the stamp and impress of the writer own character whereas in all those of addison the personal peculiarities of the delineator tho known to the reader from the beginning through the account of the club are nearly quiescent now and then they are recalled into momentary notice but they not act or at all modify his pictures of sir roger or will wimble they are amiably eccentric but the spectator in describing them takes the station of an ordinary observer everywhere indeed in the writings of lamb and not merely in his elia the character of the writer cooperates in an undercurrent to make the effect of the thing written to understand in the fullest sense either the gaiety or the tenderness of particular passage you must have some insight into the peculiar bias of the writer mind whether native and original or imprest gradually by the accidents of situation whether simply deve loped out of predispositions by the action of life or violently scorched into the constitution by some ﬁerce fever of calamity there is in modern literature whole class of writers tho not large one standing within the same category some marked originality of character in the writer becomes coefﬁcient with what he says to common result you must sympathize with this personality in the author before you can appreciate the most signiﬁcant parts of his views in most books the writer ﬁgures mere abstraction without sex or age or local station whom the reader banishes from his thoughts what is written seems to proceed from blank intellect not from man clothed with ﬂeshly peculiarities and differences these peculiarities and differences neither nor generally speaking could intermingle with the texture of the thoughts so to modify their force or their direction in such they form the vast is nothing to be found or to be looked beyond the direct objective sit venia verbo but in small section of books the objective in the thought becomes conﬂuen t with the subjective in the two forces unite joint product and fully to enjoy the product or fully to apprehend either element both must be known it is singular and worth inquiring into the reason that the greek and roman literature had such books timon of athens or diogenes one may conceive qualiﬁed this mode of authorship had journalism existed to rouse them in those days their articles would doubt have been fearfully caustic but they failed to produce anything and lucian in an after age is scarcely characteristic enough the purpose perhaps we

total word from its scattered parts is inevitable without an effort still it is always satisfaction in knowing result to know also its why and how and in so far every character is likely to be modiﬁed

will think doubt she does not it in manner that commands respect or in an impressive style did she that i should amend my faults with pleasure and dread to offend kind tho just mother but she ﬂies into ﬁt of frenzy upbraids if i was the most undutiful wretch in existence rakes up the ashes of my father abuses him says i shall be true byrrone which is the worst epithet she could invent am i to call this woman mother because by nature law she has authority over am i to be trampled upon in this manner am i to be goaded with insult loaded with obloquy and suffer my feelings to be outraged on the most trivial occasions i owe her respect son but i renounce her friend what an example does she show i hope in god i shall never follow it i have not told you all nor can i i respect you female nor altho i ought to conﬁde in you sister will i shock you with the repetition of the scenes which you may judge of by the sample i have given you and which to all but you are buried in oblivion would they were so in my mind i am afraid they never will and can i my dear sister look up to this mother with that respect that affection i ought am i to be eternally subject to her caprice i hope few short years will emancipate from the shackles i now wear and then perhaps she will govern her passion better than at present you mistake if you think i dislike lord carlisle i respect him and might like him did i know him better him too my mother has an antipathy why i know not i am afraid he will be of little use to in separatin g from her which she would oppose with all her might but i dare say he will assist if he would so i take the will the deed and am obliged to him in exactly the same manner if he succeeded in his efforts i am in great hopes that at christmas i will be with hanson

capricious that the patience of job the versatility of member of the house of commons would not support it i revere drury much more than i her yet he is never violent never outrageous i dread offending him not however through fear but the respect i bear him makes unhappy when i am under his displeasure my mother precepts never convey instruction never ﬁx upon my mind to be sure they are calculated to inculcate obedience so are chains and tortures but tho they may restrain time the mind revolts from such treatment not that byron ever injures my sacred person i am rather too old that but her words are of that rough texture which offend more than personal ill usage talkative woman is like an adder tongue so says one of the prophets but which i ca tell and very likely you wish to know but he was true one whoever he was the postage of your letters my dear augusta fall upon but if they did it would make difference i am generally in cash and should think the triﬂe i paid your

of the date and the name and i will tell you why i believe they are the only two or three words of your handwriting in my possession your letters i returned and except the two words or rather the one word household written twice in an old account book i have other i burned your last note two reasons ﬁrstly it was written in style not very agreeable and secondly i wish to take your word without documents which are the worldly resources of suspicious people i suppose that this note will reach you somewhere about ada 10th of december i believe she will then be six so that in about twelve more i shall have some chance of meeting her perhaps sooner if i am obliged to go to england by business or otherwise recollect however one thing either in distance or nearness every day that keeps us asunder should after so long period rather soften our mutual feelings which must always have one rallying point so long our child exists which i presume we both hope will be long after either of her parents the time which has elapsed since our separation has been considerably more than the whole brief period of our union and the not much longer one of our prior acquaintance we both made bitter mistake but now it is over and irrevocably so at on my part and few years less on yours tho it is very extended period of life still it is one when the habits and thought are generally so formed to admit of modiﬁcation and we could not agree while young we should with difﬁculty so now i say all this because i own to you that notwithstanding everything i consi dered our union not impossible more than year after the separation but then i gave up the hope entirely and forever but the very impossibility of reunion seems to at least reason why on all the few points of discussion which can arise between us we should preserve the courtesies of life and much of its kindness people who are never to meet may preserve perhaps more easily than nearer connections my own part i am violent but not malignant only fresh provocation can awaken my resentmen to you who are colder and more concentrated i would just hint that you may sometime s mistake the depth of cold anger dignity and worse feeling duty i assure you that i bear you now whatever i may have done resentment whatever remember that if you have injured in aught the forgiveness is something and that if i have injured you it is something more still if it be true the moralists say that the most offending are the least giving whether the offense has been solely on my side or reciprocal or on yours chieﬂy i have ceased to reﬂect upon any but two thing s that you are the mother of my child and that we shall never meet again i think if you also consider the two corresponding points with reference to myself it will be

not say how grateful i am your letter but i must own my ingratitude in not having written to you again long ago since i left england and it is not all the usual term of transportation i have scribbled to ﬁve hundred blockheads on business without difﬁculty tho with great pleasure and yet with the notion of addressing you hundred times in my head and always in my heart i have not done what i ought to have done i can only account it on the same principle of tremulous anxiety with which one sometimes makes love to beautiful woman of our own degree with whom one is enamored in good earnest whereas we attack housemaid without i speak of course of earlier times any sentimental remorse or mitigation of our virtuous purpose i owe to you far more than usual obligation the courtesies of literature and common friendship you went out of your way in 1817 to service when it required not merely kindness but courage to so to have been recorded by you in such manner would have been proud memorial at any time but at such time when all the world and his wife the proverb goes were trying to trample upon was something still higher to my allude to the quarterly review of the third canto of childe harold which murray told was written by indeed i should have known it without his information there could not be two who could and would have done this at the time had it been common criticism however eloquent or panegyrical i should have felt pleased undoubtedly and grate ful but not to the extent which the extraordinary of the whole proceeding must induce in any mind capable of such sensations the very tardiness of this acknowledgment will at least show that i have not forgotten the obligation and i can assure you that my sense of it has been out at compound interest during the delay i shall only add one word upon the subject which is that i think that you and jeffrey and leigh hunt were the only literary men of numbers whom i know and some of whom i had served who dared venture even an anonymous word in my favor just then and that of those three i had never seen one at the second much less than i that the third was under kind of obligation to whatever while the other two had been actually attacked by on former occasion one indeed with some provocation but the other wantonly enough so you see you have been heaping coals of ﬁre in the true gospel manner and i can assure you that they have burned down to my very heart i am glad you accepted the inscription 33 i meant to have inscribed the foscarini to you instead but ﬁrst i heard that cain was thought the least bad of the two composition and secondly i have abused southey like pickpocket in note to the foscarini and i recollected that he is friend of yours tho not of mine and that it would not be the handsome thing to dedicate to one friend anything containing such matters about another however i work the laureate before i have done therefor i like row and always did from boy in the course of which propensity i must needs say that i have found it the most easy of all to be gratiﬁed personally and poetically you disclaim jealousies but i would ask boswell did of johnson of whom could you be jealous none of

attica would be more poetical without the art of the acropolis of the temple of theseus and of the still all greek and glorious monuments of her exquisitely artiﬁcial genius ask the traveler what strikes him most parthenon or the rock on which it stands the columns of cape colonna 35 or the cape itself the rocks at the foot of it or the recollection that falconer ship 36 was bulged upon them there are thousand rocks and capes far more picturesque than those of the acropolis and cape sunium in themselves what are they to thousand scenes in the wilder parts of greece of asia minor switzerland or even of cintra in portugal or to many scenes of italy and the sierras of spain but it is the art the columns the temples the wrecked vessels which give them their antique and their modern poetry and not the spots themselves without them the spots of earth would be unnoticed and unknown buried like babylon and nineveh in indistinct confusion without poetry without existence but to whatever spot of earth these ruins were transported if they were capable of transportation like the obelisk and the sphinx and memnon head there they would still exist in the perfection of their beauty and in the pride of their poetry i opposed and will ever oppose the robbery of ruins from athens to instruct the english in sculpture but why did i so the ruins are poetical in piccadilly they

dying gladiator the moses of michelangelo and all the higher works of canova i have already spoken of those of ancient greece still extant in that country or transported to england are poetical mont blanc or mount ætna perhaps still more so they are direct manifestations of mind and presuppose poetry in their very conception and have moreover being such something of actual life which can not belong to any part of inanimate we adopt the system of spinoza that the world is the deity there can be nothing more poetical in its aspect than the city of venice does this depend upon the sea or the canals the dirt and seaweed whence proud venice rose is it the canal which runs between the palace and the prison or the bridge of sighs which connects them that renders it poetical is it the canal grande or the rialto which arches it the churches which tower over it the palaces which line and the gondolas which glide over the waters that render this city more poetical than rome itself bowles will say perhaps that the rialto is but marble the palaces and churches are only stone and the gondolas coarse black cloth thrown over some planks of carved wood with shining bit of fantastically formed iron at the prow without the water and i tell him that without these the water would be nothing but ditch and whoever says the contrary deserves to be at the bottom of that where pope heroes are embraced by the mud nymphs there would be nothing to make the canal of venice more poetical than that of paddington were it not the artiﬁcial adjuncts above mentioned altho it is perfectly natural

campbell that homer was great describer of works of art bowles contends that all his great power even in this depend s upon their connection with nature the shield of achilles derives its poetical interest from the subjects described on it and from what does the spear of achilles derive its interest and the helmet and the mail worn by patroclus and the celestial armor and the very brazen greaves of the greeks is it solely from the legs and the back and the breast and the human body which they enclose in that case it would have been more poetical to have made them ﬁght naked and gully and gregson being nearer to state of nature are more poetical boxing in pair of drawers than hecto r and achilles in radiant armor and with heroic weapons instead of the clash of helmets and the rushing of chariots and the whizzing of spears and the glancing of swords and the cleaving of shields and the piercing of breastplates why not represent the greeks and trojans like two savage tribes tugging and tearing and kicking and biting and gnashing foaming grinning and gouging in all the poetry of martial nature unencumbered with gross prosaic artiﬁcial arms an equal superﬂuity to the

or smack them with his hand being more unsophisticated in gray elegy is there an image more striking than his shapeless sculpture of sculpture in general it may be observed that it is more poetical than nature itself inasmuch it represents and bodies forth that ideal beauty and sublimity which is never to be found in actual nature this at least is the general opinion but always excepting the venus dei medici i differ from that opinion at least far regards female beauty the head of lady claremont when i ﬁrst saw her nine years ago seemed to possess all that sculpture could require its ideal i recollect seeing something of the same kind in the head of an albanian girl who was actually employed in mending road in the mountains and in some greek and one or two italian faces but of sublimity i have never seen anything in human nature at all to approach the expression of sculptu re either in the apollo in the moses or other of the sterner works of ancient or modern art let us examine little further this babble of green ﬁelds and of bare nature in general superior to artiﬁcial imagery the poetical purposes of the ﬁne arts in landscape painting the great artist does not give you literal copy of country but he invents and composes one nature in her natural aspect does not furnish him with such existing scenes he requires everywhere he presents you with some famous city or celebrated scene from mountain or other nature it must be taken from some particular point of view and with such light and shade and distance serve not only to heighten its beauties but to shadow its deformities the poetry of nature alone exactl y she appears is not sufﬁcient to bear him out the very sky of his painting is not the portrait of the sky of nature it is composition of different skies observed at different times and not the whole copied from any particular day and why because nature is not lavish of her beauties they are widely scattered and occasionally displayed to be selected with care and gathered with difﬁculty art is not inferior to nature poetical purposes what makes regiment of soldiers more noble object of view than the same mass of mob their arms their dresses their

falconer shipwreck over all other shipwrecks consist in his admirable application of the terms of his art in poet sailor description of the sailor fate these very terms by his application make the strength and reality of his poem why because he was poet and in the hands of poet art will not be found less ornamental than nature it is precisely in general nature and in stepping out of his element

desire to reproduce and arrange them according to certain rhythm and order which may be called the beautiful and the good the cultivation of poetry is never more to be desired than at periods when from an excess of the selﬁsh and calculating principle the accumulation of the materials of external life exceed the quantity of the power of assimilating them to the internal laws of human nature the body has then become too unwieldy that which animates it poetry is indeed something divine it is at once the center and circumference of knowledge it is that which comprehend s all science and that to which all science must be referred it is at the same time the root and blossom of all other systems of thought it is that from which all spring and that which adorns all and that which if blighted denies the fruit and the seed and withholds from the barren world the nourish ment and the succession of the scions of the tree of life it is the perfect and consummate surface and bloom of all things it is the odor and the color of the rose to the textu re of the elements which compose it the form and splendor of unfaded beauty to the secrets of anatomy and corruption what were virtue love patriotism were the scenery of this beautiful universe which we were our consolations on this side of the what were our aspirations beyond it if poetry did not ascend to bring light and ﬁre from those eternal regions where the faculty of calculation dare not ever soar poetry is not like reasoning power to be exerted according to the determination of the will man can not say it i will compose poetry the greatest poet even can not say it the mind in creation is fading coal which some invisible inﬂuence like an inconstant wind awakens to transitory brightness this power arises from within like the color of ﬂower which fades and changes it is developed and the conscious portions of our natures are unprophetic either of its approach or its departure could this inﬂuence be durable in its original purity and force it is impossible to predict the greatness of the results but when composition begins inspiration is already on the decline and the most glorious poetry that has ever been communicated to the world is probably feeble shadow of the original conception of the poet i appeal to the greatest poets of the present day whether it is not an error to assert that the ﬁnest passages of poetry are produced by labor and study the toil and the delay recommended by critics can be justly interpreted to mean more than careful observation of the inspired moments and an artiﬁcial connection of the space between their suggestions by the intermixture of conventional expression necessity only imposed by the limitedness of the poetical faculty itself milton conceived the paradise lost whole before he executed it in portions we have his own authority also the muse having dictated to him the unpremeditated song and let this be an answer to those who allege the various readings of the 152 153 the

instinct and intuition of the poetical faculty is still more observable in the plastic and pictorial arts great statue or picture grows under the power of the artist child in the mother womb and the very mind which directs the hands in formation is incapable of accounting to itself the origin the gradations or the media of the process poetry is the record of the best and happiest moments of the happiest and best minds we are aware of evanescent visitations of thought and feeling sometimes associated with place or person sometimes regarding our own mind alone and always arising unforeseen and departing unbidden but elevating and delightful beyond all expression so that even in the desire and the regret they leave there can not but be pleasure participating it does in the nature of its object it is it were the interpenetration of diviner nature through our own but its footsteps are like those of wind over the sea which the coming calm erases and whose traces remain only on the wrinkled sand which paves it these and corresponding conditions of being are experienced principally by those of the most delicate sensibility and the most enlar ged imagination and the state of mind produced by them is at war with every base desire the enthusiasm of virtue love patrio tism and friendship is essentially linked with such emotions and while they last self appears what it is an atom

earth and sky on the other narrow chasm which is bounded by an arch of enormous size tinged by the many colored foliage and blossoms and supporting an irregular pyramid overgrown like itself with the vegetation around rise other crags and other peaks all arrayed and the deformity of their vast desolation softened down by the undecaying investiture of nature come to is scene by which expression is

anemones wall ﬂowers and violets whose stalks pierce the starry moss and with radiant blue ﬂowers whose name i know not and which scatter through the air the divinest odor which you recline under the shade of the ruin produces sensations of voluptuous faintness like the combinations of sweet music the paths still wind on threading the perplexed windings other labyrinths other lawns deep dells of

and then the islands after which we shall return to rome i was astonished at the remains of this city i had conception of anything so perfect yet remaining my idea of the mode of its destruction was this ﬁrst an earthquake came and shattered it and unroofed almost all its temples and split its columns then rain of light small fell then torrents of boiling water mixt with ashes ﬁlled up its crevices wide ﬂat hill from which the city was excavated is now covered with woods and you see the tombs and theaters the temples and houses surrounded by uninhabited wilderness we entered the town from the sides toward the sea and ﬁrst saw two theaters one more magniﬁcent than the other strewn with the ruins of the white marble which formed their seats and cornices wrough t with deep bold sculpture in the front between the stage and the seats is the circular space occasionally occupied by the chorus the stage is very narrow but long and divide d from this space by narrow enclosur parallel to it i suppose the orchestra on each side are the consuls boxes and below in the theater of herculaneum were found two equestrian statues of excellent workmanship occupying the same space the great bronze lamps did at drury lane the smallest of the theaters is said to have been comic tho i should doubt from both you see you sit on the seats prospect of the most wonderful beauty you then pass through ancient streets they are very narrow and the houses rather small but are constructed on an admirable plan especially the climate the rooms are built round court or sometimes two according to the extent of the house in the midst is fountain sometimes surrounded with portico supported on ﬂuted columns of white stucco the ﬂoor is paved with mosaics sometimes wrought in imitation of vine leaves sometimes in quaint ﬁgures and more or less beautiful according to the rank of the inhabitant there were paintings on all but most of them have been removed to decorate the royal museums little winged ﬁgure s and small ornaments of exquisite elegance yet 157 158 159 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https there is an ideal life in the forms of these paintings of an incomparable loveliness tho most are evidently the work of very inferior artists it seems if from the atmosphere of mental beauty that surrounds them every human being caught splendor not his own in one house you see how the bedrooms were managed small sofa was built up where the cushions were placed two pictures one representing diana and endymio n and the other venus and mars decorate the chamber and little niche which contains the statue of domestic god the ﬂoor is composed of rich mosaic of the rarest marbles agate jasper and porphyry it looks to the marble fountain and the snow white columns whose etablatures strew the ﬂoor of the portico they supported the houses have only one story and the apartments tho not large are very lofty great advantage results from this wholly unknown in our cities the public buildings whose ruins are now forests it were of white ﬂuted columns and which then supported entablatures loaded with sculpture were seen on all sides over the roofs of the houses this was the excellence of the ancients their private expen ses were comparatively moderate the dwelling of one of the chief senators of pompeii is elegant indeed and adorned with the most beautiful specimens of art but small but their public buildings are everywhere marked by the bold and grand designs of an unsparing magniﬁcence in the little town of pompeii it contained about twenty thousand inhabitants it is wonderful to see the number and grandeur of their public buildings another advantage too is that in the present case the glorious scenery around is not shut out and that unlike the inhabitants of the cimmerian ravines of modern cities the ancient pompeiian could contemplate the clouds and the lamps of heaven could see the moon rise high behind vesuvius and the sun set in the sea tremulous with an atmo sphere of golden vapor below inarnine and misenum we next saw the temples of the temple of æsculapius little remains but an altar of black stone adorned with cornice imitating the scales of serpent his statue in was found in the cell the temple of isis is more perfect it is surrounded by portico of ﬂuted columns and in the area around it are two altars and many ceppi statues and little chapel of white stucco hard stone of the most exquisite proportions its panels are adorned with ﬁgures in slightly indicated but of workmanship the most delicate that can be conceived they are egyptian subjects executed by greek artist who has humanized all the unnatural extravagance of the original conception into the supernatural loveliness of his country genius they scarcely touch the ground with their feet and their wind uplifted robes seem in the place of wings the temple in the midst raised on high platform and approached by steps was decorated with exquisite paintings some of which we saw in the museum at porticai it is small of the same materials the chapel with pavement of mosaic and ﬂuted ionic columns of white stucco so white that it dazzles you to look at it thence through other porticoes and labyrinths of walls and columns some broken some entire their entablatures strewed under them the temple of jupiter of venus and another temple the tribunal and the hall of public justice with the forests of lofty columns surround the forum two pedestals or altars of an enormous size whether they were the altars of the temple of venus before which they stand the guide could not tell occupy the lower end of the forum at the upper end supported on an elevated platform stands the temple of jupiter under the colonnade of its portico we sat and pulled out our oranges and ﬁgs and bread sorry fare you will say and started to eat here was magniﬁcent spectacle above and between the multitudinous shafts of the sunshiny columns was seen the sea reﬂecting the purple heaven of noon above it and supporting it were on its lips the dark lofty mountains of sorrento of blue indescribably deep and tinged toward their summits with streaks of new fallen snow between was one small green island to the right was capreæ inarnine prochyta and misenum behind was the single summit of vesuvius

autumn shiver and rustle in the stream of the inconstant wind it were like the steps of ghosts the radiance and magniﬁcence of these dwellings of the dead the white freshness of the scarcely ﬁnished

to start when an event happened which fatally poisoned the prevalent cheerfulness of the city this was the mutilation of the hermæ one of the most extraordinary events in all grecian history the hermæ or of the god hermes were blocks of marble about the height of the human ﬁgure the upper part was cut into head face neck and bust the lower part was left quadrangular pillar broad at the base without arms body or legs but with the signiﬁcant mark of the male sex in front they were distributed in great numbers throughout athens and always in the most conspicuous situations standing beside the outer doors of private houses well of the most frequented porticoes the intersection of the public agora they were thus present to the eye of every athenian in all his acts of either business or pleasure with his fellow citizens the religious feeling of the greeks considered the god to be planted or domiciliated where his statue stood so that the companionship sympathy and guardianship of hermes became associated with most of the manifestations of conjunct life at athens political social commercial or gymnastic moreover the quadrangular fashion of these statues employed occasionally other gods besides herm es was most ancient relic handed down from the primitive rudeness of pelasgian workmanship and was popular in arcadia well peculiarly frequent in athens about the end of may 415 in the course of one and the same night all these hermæ one of the most peculiar marks of the city were mutilated by unknown hands their characteristic features were knocked off or leveled so that nothing was left except mass of stone with resemblance to humanity or deity all were thus dealt with in the same 38 39 165 166 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of

shall in part comprehend the intensity of mingled dismay terror and wrath which beset the public mind on the morning after this nocturnal sacrilege alike unforeseen and unparalleled amidst all the ruin and impoverishment which had been inﬂicted by the persian invasion of attica there was nothing which was so profoundly felt or so long remembered the deliberate burning of the statues and temple of the gods if we could imagine the excitement of spanish or italian town on ﬁnding that all the images of the virgin had been defaced during the same night we should have parallel to what was now felt at religious associations and persons were far more intimately allied with all civil acts and with all the proceedings of too the god and his efﬁciency were more forcibly localized well identiﬁed with the presence and keeping of the statue to the athenians when they went forth on the following morning each man seeing the divine guardian at his doorway dishonored and defaced and each man gradually coming to know that the devastation was would seem that the town had become it were the streets the place the porticoes were robbed of their divine protectors and what was worse still that these protectors having been grossly insulted carried away with them alienated and vindictive instead of tutelary and sympathizing it was on the protection of the gods that all their political constitution well the blessings of civil life depended insomuch that the curses of the gods were habitually invoked sanction and punishment grave offenses political well others an extension and generalization of the feeling still attache d to the judicial oath this was in the minds of the people of athens sincere and literal simply form of speech to be pronounced in prayers and public haran gues without being ever construed reality in calculating consequences and determining practical measures accordingly they drew from the mutilation of the hermæ the inference not less natural than terrifying that heavy public misfortune was impending over the city and that the political constitution to which they were attached was in imminent danger of being subverted such was the mysterious incident which broke in upon the eager and bustling movement of athens few days before the sicilian expedition was starting in reference to that expedition it was taken to heart most depressing omen it would doubtless have been so interpreted had it been mere undesigned accident happening to any venerated religious we are told that similar misgivings were occasione d by the occurrence about this same time of the melancholy festival of the adonia wherein the women loudly bewailed the untimely death of adonis the mutilation of the hermæ however was something much more ominous than the worst accident it proclaimed itself the deliberate act of organized conspirators not inconsiderable in numbe r whose names and ﬁnal purpose were indeed unknown but who had begun by committing sacrilege of character ﬂagrant and unheard of intentional mutilation of public and sacred statue where the material afforded temptation to plunder is case to which we know parallel much more mutilation by by one band and in one night throughout an entire city tho neither the parties concerned nor their purposes were ever more than partially made out the concert and conspiracy itself is unquestionable it seems probable far we can form an opinion that the conspirators had two objects perhaps some of them one and some the other ruin alcibiades 42 167 168 169 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the

of teukrus and other metics implicated renders it more likely that they were inﬂuenced by sympathies with corinth and megara prompting them to intercept an expedition which was supposed to promise great triumphs to than corrupted by the violent antip athies of intestine politics indeed the two objects were intimately connected with each other the prosecution of the enterprise while full of prospective conquest to athens was yet more pregnant with future power and wealth to alcibiades himself such chances would disappear if the expedition could be prevented nor was it at all impossible that the athenians under the intense impression of religious terror consequent on the mutilation of the hermæ might throw up the scheme altogether especially nicias exquisitely sensitive in his own religious conscience and never hearty in his wish going fact perfectly known to the enemy would hasten to consult his prophets and might reasonably be expected to renew his opposition on the fresh ground offered to him or at least to claim delay until the offended gods should have been appeased we may judge how much such proceeding was in the line of his character and of the athenian character when we ﬁnd him two years afterward with the full concurrence of his soldiers actually sacriﬁcing the last opportunity of safe retreat the athenian army in sicily and refusing even to allow the proposition to be debated in consequence of an eclipse of the moon and when we reﬂect that greeks frequently renounced public designs if an earthquake happened before the execution but tho the chance of setting aside the expedition altogether might reasonably enter into the plans of the conspirators likely consequence of the intense shock inﬂicted on the religious mind of athens and especial ly of calculation was not realized probably matters had already proceeded too far even nicias to recede notice had been sent around to all the allies forces were already on their way to the rendezvous at corcyra at argeian and mantineian allies were arriving at piræus to embark so much the more eagerly did the conspirators proceed in that which i have stated the other part of their probable plan to work that exaggerated religious terror which they had themselves artiﬁcially brought about the ruin of alcibiades few men in athens either had or deserv ed to have greater number of enemies political well private than alcibiades many of them being among the highest citizens whom he offended by his insolence and whose liturgies and other customary exhibitions he outshone by his reckless expenditu

mutilators of the hermæ seemed to have deliberately planned his other enemies were ready to turn to proﬁt ii if alexander had lived 43 the death of alexander thus suddenly cut off by fever in the plenitude of health vigor and aspirations was an event impressive well important in the highest possible degree to his contemporaries far and near when the ﬁrst report of it was brought to athens the orator demades exclaimed it can not be true if alexander were dead the whole habitable world would have smelt of his carcass this coarse but emphatic comparison illustrates the immediate powerful and impression produced by the sudden extinction of the great conqueror it was felt by each of the many remote envoys who had so recently come to propitiate this every man 170 171 172 the project

grander and vaster and so completely without serious reverse or even interruption to transcend the measure not only of human expectation but almost of human belief the great king the king of persia was called by excellence was and had long been the type of worldly power and felicity even down to the time when alexander crossed the hellespont within four years and three months from this event by one stupendous defeat after another darius had lost all his western empire and had become fugitive eastward of the caspian gates escaping captivity at the hands of alexander only to perish by those of the satrap bessus all antecedent historical ruin and captivity of the lydian crœsus the expulsion and mean life of the syracusan dionysius both of them impressive examples of the mutability of human

the rising to the setting not he now struggling to the last not dominion over others but the safety of his own person such were the sentiments excited by alexander career even in the middle of 330

mere ly all the eastern half of the persian empire but unknown indian regions beyond its easternmost limits besides macedonia greece and thrace he possest all that immense treasure and military force which had once rendered the great king so formidable by contemporary man had any such power ever been known or conceived with the turn of imagination then prevalent many were doubtless disposed to take him god on earth grecian spectators had once suppo sed with regard to xerxes when they beheld the innumerable persian host crossing the hellespont exalted to this prodigious grandeur alexander was at the time of his death little more than years age at which citizen of athens was growing into important commands ten years less than the age consul at rome two years younger than the age at which timour ﬁrst acqu ired the crown and began his foreign conquests his extraordinary bodily powers were unabated he had acquired large stock of military experience and what was still more important his appetite further conquest was voracious and his readiness to purchase it at the largest cost of toil or danger complete it had been when he ﬁrst crossed the hellespont great his past career had been his future achievements with such increased means and experience were likely to be yet greater his ambition would have been satisﬁed with nothing less than the conquest of the whole habitable world then known and if his life had been prolonged he would probably have accomplished it nowhere so far our knowledge reaches did there reside any military power capab le of making head against him nor were his soldiers when he commanded them daunted or bafﬂed by any extremity of cold heat or fatigue the patriotic feelings of livy dispose him to maintain that alexander had he invaded italy and assailed romans or samnites would have failed and perished like his relative alexander of epirus but this conclusion can not be accepted if we grant the courage and discipline of the roman infantry to have been equal to the best infantry of alexander army the same can not be said of the roman cavalry compared with the macedonian companions still less is it likely that roman consul annually changed

enemies they nor even such samnites and courage patriotism discipline with ef fective arms both defense and close combat among all the qualities which go to constitute the highest military excellence either general or soldier none was wanting in the character of alexander togethe r with his own chivalrous indeed both excessive and unseasonable so to form the only military defect which can fairly be imputed to trace in all his operations the most careful dispositions taken beforehand vigilant precaution in guarding against possible reverse and abundant resource in adapting himself to new contingencies amidst constant success these precautionary combinations were never discontinued his achievements are the earliest recorded evidence of scientiﬁc military organiza tion on large scale and of its overwhelming effects alexander overawes the imagination more than any other personage of antiquity by the matchless development of all that constitutes effective an individual warrior and organizer and leader of armed masses not merely the blind impetuosity ascribed by homer to ares but also the intelligent methodized and g compression which he personiﬁes in athene but all his great qualities were ﬁt use only against enemies in which category indeed were numbered all mankind known and unknown except those who chose to submit to him in his indian campaigns amidst tribes of utter strangers we perceive that not only those who stand on their defense but also those who abandon their property and ﬂee to the mountains are alike pursued and slaughtered apart from the transcendent merits of alexander soldier and general some authors give him credit grand and beneﬁcent views on the subject of imperial government and intentions highly favorable to the improvement of mankind i see

traversed and subjugated all the inhabited globe the acquisition of universal not metaphorically but literally and conceived with greater facility in consequence of the imperfect geographical knowledge of the the master of his soul at the moment of his death he was commencing fresh aggression in the south against the arabians to an indeﬁnite extent while his vast projects against the western tribes in africa and europe far the pillars of hercules were consigne d in the orders and memoranda conﬁdentially communicated to kraterus italy gaul and spain would have been successively attacked and conquered the enterprises proposed to him when in bactria by the chorasmian prince pharasmanes but postponed then until more convenient season would have been next taken up and he would have marched from the danube northward round the euxine and palus mæotis 45 against the scythians and the tribes of the caucasus there remained moreover the asiatic regions east of the hyphasis which his soldiers had refused to enter upon but which he certainly would have invaded at future opportunity were it only to efface the poignant humiliation of having been compelled to relinquish his proclaimed purpose tho this sounds like romance and hyperbole it was nothing more than the real insatiate aspiration of alexander who looked upon every new acquisition mainly capital acquiring more you are man like all of us alexander said the naked indian to him except that you abandon your home like meddlesome destroyer to invade the most distant regions enduring hardship yourself and inﬂicting hardship upon others now how an empire thus boundless and heterogeneous such prince has ever yet realized could have been administered with any superior adva ntages to subjects it would be

of his greatness samuel johnson too is that kind of man the wide element of mournful black enveloping him the world it is the character of prophetic man man with his whole soul seeing and struggling to see on this ground too i explain to myself cromwell reputed confusion of speech to himself the internal meaning was ear but the material with which he was to clothe it in utterance was not there he had lived silent great unnamed sea of thought round him all his days and in his way of life little call to attempt naming or uttering that with his sharp power of vision resolute power of action i

manhood is not fair immaculate regularity it is ﬁrst of all what the germans well name it tugend taugend or dough courage and the faculty to this basis of the matter cromwell had in him one understands moreover how tho he could not speak in parliament he might preach rhapsodic preaching above all how he might be great in extempore prayer these are the free outpouring utterances of what is in the heart method is not required in them warmth depth sincerity are all that is required cromwell habit of prayer is notable feature of him all his great enterprises were commenced with prayer in dark difﬁculties his ofﬁcers and he used to assemble and pray alternately hours days till some deﬁnite resolution rose among them some door of hope they would name it disclosed itself consider that in tears in fervent prayers and cries to the great god to have pity on them to make his light shine before them they armed soldiers of christ they felt themselves to be little band of christian brothers who had drawn the sword against great black devouring world not christian but mammonish devilish cried to god in their straits in their extreme need not to forsake the cause that was his the light which now rose upon them could human soul by any means at all get better light was not the purpose so formed like to be precisely the best wisest the one to be followed without hesitation any more to them it was the shining of heaven own splendor in the darkness the pillar of fire by night that was to guide them on their desolate perilous way was it not such can man soul to this hour get guidance by any other method than intrinsically by that same prostration of the earnest struggling soul before the highest the giver of all light be such prayer spoken articulate or be it voiceless inarticulate one there is other method hypocrisy one begins to be weary of all that they who call it so have right to speak on such matters they never formed purpose what one can call purpose they went about balancing expediencies plausibilities gathering votes advices they never were alone with the truth of thing at prayers were likely to be eloquent and much more than that his was the heart of man who could pray but indeed his actual speeches i apprehend were not nearly so ineloquent incondite they look we ﬁnd he was what all speakers aim to be an impressive speaker even in parliament one who from the ﬁrst had weight with that rude passionate voice of his he was always understood to mean something and men wished to know what he disregarded eloquence nay despised and disliked it spoke always without premeditation of the words he was to use the reporters too in those days seem to have been singularly candid and to have given the printer precisely what they have found on their own and withal what strange proof is it of cromwell being the premeditative hypocrite acting play before the world that to the last he took more charge of his speeche s how came he not to study his words little before ﬂinging them out to the public if the words were true words they could be left to shift themselves but with regard to cromwell lying we will make one remark this i suppose or something like this to have been the nature of it all parties found themselves deceived in him each party understood him to be meaning this heard him even say so and behold he to have been meaning that he was cry they the chief of liars but how intrinsically is not all this the inevitable fortune not of false man in such times but simply of superior man such man must have reticences in him if he walk wearing his heart upon his sleeve daws to peck at his journey will not extend far there is use any man his abode in house built of glass man always is to be himself the judge how much of his mind he will show to other men even to those he would have work along with him there are impertinent inquiries made your rule is to leave the inquirer uninformed on that matter not if you can help it

what the wise and faithful man would aim to answer in such case cromwell doubt of it spoke often in the dialect of small subaltern parties uttered to them part of his mind each little party thought him all its own hence their rage one and all to ﬁnd him not of their party but of his own party was it his blame at all seasons of his history he must have felt among such people how if he explained to them the deeper insight he had they must either have shuddered aghast at it or believing it their own little compact hypothesis must have gone wholly to wreck they could not have worked in his province any more nay perhaps they could not have now worked in their own province it is the inevitable position of great man among small men small men most active useful are to be seen everywhere whose whole activity depends on some conviction which to you is palpably limited one imperfect what we call an error but would it be kindness always is it duty always or often to disturb them in that many man doing loud work in the world stands only on some thin traditionality conventionality to him indubitable to you incredible break that beneath him he sinks to endless depths i might have my hand full of truth said fontenelle and open only my little ﬁnger and if this be the fact even in matters of doctrine how much more in all departments of practise he that can not withal keep his mind to himself can not practise any considerable thing whatever and we call it dissimulation all this what would you think of calling the general of an army dissembler because he did not tell every corporal and private soldier who pleased to put the question what his thoughts were about everything cromwell i should rather say managed all this in manner we must admire its perfection an endless vortex of such questioning corporals rolled confused ly round him through his whole course whom he did answer it must have been great seeing man that he managed this too not one proved falsehood i said not one of what man that ever wound himself through such coil of things will you say so much but in fact there are two errors widely prevalent which pervert to the very basis our judgments formed about such men cromwell about their ambition falsity and suchlike the ﬁrst is what i might call substituting the goal of their career the course and of it the vulgar historian of cromwell fancies that he had determined on being protector of england at the time when he was plowing the marsh lands of cambridgeshire his career lay all program of the whole drama which he then step by step dramatically unfolded with all manner of cunning deceptive dramatur gy he went on hollow scheming hypocrites or that he was this is radical perversion all but universal in such cases and think an instant how different the fact is how much does one of us foresee of his own life short way ahead of us it is all dim an unwound skein of possibilities of apprehensions attemptabilities hopes this cromwell had not his life lying all in that fashion of program which he needed then with that unfathomable cunning of his only to enact dramatically scene after scene not so we see it so but to him it was in measure so what absurdities would fall away of themselv es were this one undeniable fact kept honestly in view by history historians indeed will tell you that they keep it in view look whether such is practically the fact vulgar history in this cromwell case omits it altogether even the best kinds of history only remember it now and then to remember it duly with rigorous perfection in the fact it stood requires indeed rare faculty rare nay impossible very shakespeare faculty or more than shakespeare who could enact brother man biography see with the brother man eyes at all points of his course what things he saw in short know his course and him few historians are like to half or more of all the perversions which distort our image of cromwell will disappear if we hone stly so much try to represent them so in sequence they were not in the lump they are thrown down before us but second error which i think the generality commit refers to this same ambition itself we exaggerate the ambition of great men we mistake what the nature of it is great men are not ambitious in that sense he is small poor man that is ambitious so 195 196 197 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the

painted great who were vastly smaller than he little doubt moreover that of the specially good very large portion according to any genuine standard of man worth were worthle ss in comparison to him he whom scott is great may most innocently name him so may with advantage admire his great qualities and ought with sincere heart to emulate him at the same time it is good that there be certain degree of precision in our epithets it is good to understand one thing that popularity and wonder of all the world continued even long series of years can make man great such popularity is remarkable fortune indicates great adaptation of the man to his element of circumstances but may or may not indicate anything great in the man to our imagination above hinted there is certain apotheosis in it but in the reality apotheosis at all popularity is blaze of illumination or alas of conﬂagration kindled round man showing what is in him not putting the smallest item more into him often abstracting much from him conﬂagrating the poor man himself into ashes and caput mortuum and then by the nature of it such popularity is transient your series of years quite unexpectedly sometimes almost all on sudden

simply nothing toward scott greatness or an accident not quality shorn of this falsifying nimbus and reduced to his own natural dimensi ons there remains the reality walter scott and what we can ﬁnd in him to be accounted great or not great according to the dialects of men friends to precision of epithet will probably deny his title to the name great it seems to us there goes other stuff to the making of great men than can be detected here one knows not what idea worthy of the name of great what purpose instinct or tendency that could be called great scott ever was inspired with his life was worldly his ambitions were worldly there was nothing spiritual in him all is economical material of the earth earthy love of picturesque of beautiful vigorous and graceful things genuine love yet not more genuine than has dwelt in hundreds of men named minor poets this is the highest quality to be discerned in him his power of representing these things too his poetic power like his moral power was genius in extenso we may say not in intenso in action in speculation broad he was he rose nowhere high productive without measure to quantity in quality he the most part transcended but little way the region of commonplace it has been said man has written many volumes with so few sentences that can be quoted winged words were not his vocation nothing urged him that way the great mystery of existence was not great to him did not drive him into rocky solitudes to wrestle with it an answer to be answered or to perish he had nothing of the martyr into dark region to slay monsters us did he either led or driven venture down his conquests were his own behoof mainly conquests over common market labor and reckonable in good metallic coin of the realm the thing he had faith in except power power of what sort soever and even of the rudest sort would be difﬁcult to point out one sees not that he believed in anything nay he did not even disbelieve but quietly acquiesced and made himself at home in world of conventionalities the false the and the true were alike true in this that they were there and had power in their hands more or less it was well to feel so and yet not well we ﬁnd it written wo to them that are at ease in zion but surely it is double wo to them that are at ease in babel in domdaniel on the other hand he wrote many volumes amusi ng many thousands of men shall we call this great it seems to us there dwells and struggles another sort of spirit in the inward parts of great men yet on the other hand the surliest critic must allow that scott was genuine man which itself is great matter affectation fantasticality or distortion dwelt in him shadow of cant nay withal was he not right brave and strong man according to his kind what load of toil what measure of felicity he quietly bore along with him with what quiet strength he both worked on this earth and enjoyed in it invincible to evil fortune and to good most composed invincible man in difﬁculty and distress knowing discouragement carrying off on his strong the gates that would imprison him in danger and menace laughing at the whisper of fear and then with such sunny current of true humor and humanity free joyful symp athy with so many things what of ﬁre he had all lying so beautifully latent radical latent heat fruitful internal warmth of life most robust healthy man the truth is our best deﬁnition of scott were perhaps even this that he was if great man then something much pleasanter to be robust thoroughly healthy and withal very prosperous and victorious man an eminently man healthy in body healthy in soul we will call him one of the healthiest of men neither is this small matter health is great matter both to the possessor of it and to others scott career of writing impromptu novels to buy farms with was not of kind to terminate voluntarily but to accelerate itself more and more and one sees not to what wise goal it could in any case have led him bookseller constable bankruptcy was not the ruin of scott his ruin was that ambition and even false ambition had laid hold of him that his way of life was not wise whither could it lead where could it stop new farms there remained ever to be bought while new novels could pay them more and 209 210 211 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https success but gave more and more appetite more and more audacity the impromptu writing must have waxed ever thinner declined faster and faster into the questionable category into the condemnable into the general condemned already there existed in secret everywhere considerable opposition party witnesses of the waverly miracles unable to believe in them but forced silently to protest against them such opposition party was in the sure case to grow and even with the impromptu process ever going on ever waxing thinner to draw the world over to it silent protest must at length come to words harsh truths backed by harsher facts of and worn out behoved to have been spoken can be spoken now without reluctance when they can pain the brave man heart more who knows perhaps it was better ordered to be all otherwise otherwise at any rate it was one day the constable mountain which seemed to stand strongly like the other rock mountains gave suddenly the iceber gs crack suddenly with huge clangor shivered itself into and sank carrying much along with it in one day scott became fairy and nonentity in one day the rich man and lord of land saw himself penniless landless bankrupt among creditors it was hard trial he met it proudly brave proud man of the world perhaps there had been prouder way still to have owned honestly that he was unsuccessful then all bankrupt broken in the world goods and repute and to have turned elsewhither some refuge refuge did lie elsewhere but it was not scott course or fashion of mind to seek it there to say hitherto i have been all in the wrong and this my fame and pride now broken was an empty delusion and spell of accursed witchcraft it was difﬁcult ﬂesh and blood he said i will retrieve myself and make my point good yet or die it silently like proud strong man he girt himself to the hercules task of removing since that was it of paying large ransoms by what he could still write and sell in his declining years too misfortune is doubly and trebly unfortunate that befalls us then scott fell to his hercules task like very man and went on with it unweariedly with noble cheerfulness while his ngs were cracking he grappled with it and wrestled with it years long in strength to strength and it proved the stronger and his life and heart did crack and break the cordage of most strong heart over these last writings of scott his napoleons demonologies scotch histories and the rest criticism ﬁnding still much to wonder at much to commend will utter word of blame this one word only wo is the noble warhorse that once laughed at the shaking of the spear how is he doomed to toil himself dead dragging ignoble wheels scott descent was like that of spent projectile rapid straight down perhaps mercifully so it is tragedy all life is one proof more that fortune stands on restless globe that ambition never yet proﬁted any man and so the curtain falls and the strong walter scott is with us more possession from him does remain widely scattered yet attainable not inconsiderable it can be said of him when he departed he took man life along with him sounder piece of british manhood was put together in that eighteenth century of time

time when the old reverent feeling of discipleship such brought men from far countries with rich gifts and prostrate soul to the feet of the prophets had passed utterly away from men practical experience was longer surmised to exist it does perennial indestructible in man inmost heart boswell should have been the individual of all others predestined to recall it in such singular guise to the wondering and long while laughing and unrecognising world it has been commonly said the man vulgar vanity was all that attached him to johnson he delighted to be seen near him to be thought connected with him now let it be at once granted that consideration springing out of vulgar vanity could well be absent from the mind of james boswell in this his intercourse with johnson or in any considerable transaction of his life at the same time ask yourself whether such vanity and nothing else actuated him therein whether this was the true essence and moving principle of the phenomenon or not rather its outward vesture and the accidental environment and defacement in which it came to light the man was by nature and habit vain be it granted but had there been nothing more than vanity in him was samuel johnson the 215 216 217 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https of men to whom he must attach himself at the date when johnson was poor scholar dwelling in and indeed throughout their whole intercourse afterwards were there not chancellors and prime ministers enough graceful gentlemen the glass of fashion honor noblemen dinner giving rich men renowned swordsmen gownsmen quacks and realities of all hues one of whom bulked much larger in the world eye than johnson ever did to any one of whom by half that submissiveness and assiduity our bozzy might have recommended himself and sat there the envy of surrounding lickspittles pocketing now solid emolument swallowing now d viands and wines of rich vintage in each case also shone on by some glittering reﬂex of renown or notoriety so to be the observed of innumerable observers to one of whom however though otherwise most diligent solicitor and purveyor did he so attach himself such vulgar courtiers hips were his paid drudgery or the worship of johnson was his grand ideal voluntary business does not the yet enthusiastic man dofﬁng his advocate wig

blind old woman feeling the cups whether they are full with her ﬁnger and patiently endured contradictions without end too happy so he may but be allowed to listen and live nay it does not appear that vulgar vanity could ever have been much ﬂattered by boswell relation to johnson croker says johnson was to the last little regarded by the great world from which vulgar vanity all honor from its fountain descends bozzy even among johnson friends and special admirers seems rather to have been laughed at than envied his ofﬁcious whisking consequential ways the daily reproofs and rebuffs he underwent could gain from the world golden but only leaden opinions his devout discipleship seemed nothing more than mean spanielship in the general eye his mighty constellation or sun round whom he satellite observantly gyrated was the mass of men but huge fed and he weak circling foolishly dangerously about it not knowing what he wanted if he enjoyed highland dinners and toasts henchman to new sort of chieftain henry erskine in the domestic outer could hand him shilling the sight of his bear doubtless the man was laughed at and often heard himself laughed at his johnsonism to be envied is the grand and sole aim of vulgar vanity to be ﬁlled with good things is that of sensuality johnson perhaps man living envied poor bozzy and of good things except himself paid them there was vestige in that acquaintanceship had nothing other or better than vanity and sensuality been there johnson and boswell had never come together or had soon and ﬁnally separated again consider too with what force diligence and vivacity he has rendered back all this which in johnson neighborhood his open sense had so eagerly and freely taken in that work of his is picture by one of nature own artists the best possible resemblance of reality like the very image thereof in clear mirror which indeed it was let but the mirror be clear this is the great point the picture must and will be genuine how the

through the organs of boswell we the man intellectual endowments great wrong if we measure it by its mere logical outcome though here too there is not wanting light ingenuity ﬁgurativeness and

the unusual defect of amalgamation and subordin ation the highest lay side by side with the lowest not morally combined with it and spiritually transﬁguring it but tumbling in juxtaposition with it and from time to time the mad alternation chanced irradiating it or eclipsed by it the book itself questionless the universal favor entertained it is well merited in worth book we have rated it beyond any other product of the eighteenth century all johnson own writings laborious and in their kind genuine above most stand on quite inferior level to it already indeed they are becoming obsolete this generation and some future generations may be valuable chieﬂy prolegomena and expository scholia to this johnsoniad of boswell which of us but remembers one of the sunny spots in his existence the day when he opened these airy volumes fascinating him by true it was if the curtains of the past were drawn aside and we looked mysteriously into kindred country where dwelt our fathers inexpressibly dear to us but which had seemed forever hidden from our eyes the dead night had engulfed it all was gone vanished if it had not been nevertheless wondrously given back to us there once more it lay all bright lucid blooming little island of creation amid the circumambient void there it still lies like thing stationary imperishable over which changeful time were now accumulating itself in vain and could not any longer harm it or hide it thus boswell life of johnson has time done is time still doing what ornament of art or artiﬁce could have done it rough samuel and sleek wheedling james were

with all her shining waxed tables larder her cooks and bootjacks and and gone gone the becking waiter that with wreathed smiles wont to spread samuel and bozzy their supper of the gods has long since pocketed his last sixpence and vanished sixpence and all like ghost at the bottles they drank out of are all broken the chairs they sat on all rotted and burnt the very knives and forks they ate with

of the edict of destiny so that time shall not utterly not so soon by several centuries have dominio n over us little row of with its line of burns clear and holy through the dead night of the past they who are gone are still here though hidden they are revealed though dead they yet speak there it shines that little miraculously pathway shedding its feebler and feebler 221 222 223 the project

little pathway we can still travel and see wonders viii might burns ha ve been sa ved 55 contemplating this sad end of burns and how he sank unaided by any real help uncheered by any wise sympathy gener ous minds have sometimes ﬁgured to themselves with reproachful sorrow that much might have been done by counsel true affection and friendly ministrations he might have been saved to himself and the world we question whether there is not more tenderness of heart than soundness of judgment in these suggestions it seems dubious to us whether the richest wisest most benevolent individual could have lent burns any effectual help counsel which seldom proﬁts any one he did not need in his understanding he knew right from wrong well perhaps any man ever did but the persuasion which would have availed him lies not so much in the head in the heart where argument or expostulation could have assisted much to implant it to money again we not really believe that this was his essential want or well see how any private man could even presupposing burns consent have bestowed on him an independent fortune with much prospect of decisive advantage it is mortifying truth that two men in any rank of society could hardly be found virtuous enough to give money and to take it necessary gift without injury to the moral entireness of one or both but so stands the fact friendship in the old heroic sense of that term longer exists except in the cases of kindred or other legal afﬁnity it is in reality longer expected or recognized virtue among men close observer of manners has pronounced patronage that is pecuniary or other economic furtherance to be twice cursed cursing him that gives and him that takes and thus in regard to outward matters also it has become the rule in regard to inward it always was and must be the rule that one shall look effectual help to another but that each shall rest contented with what help he can afford himself such we say is the principle of modern enough growing out of that sentiment of pride which we inculcate and encourage the basis of our whole social morality many poet has been poorer than burns but one was ever prouder we may question whether without great precautions even pension from royalty would not have galled and encumbe red more than actually assisted him still less therefore are we disposed to join with another class of burns admirers who accuse the higher ranks among us of having ruined burns by their selﬁsh neglect of him we have already stated our doubts whether direct pecuniary help had it been offered would have been accepted or could have proved very effectual we shall readily admit however that much was to be done burns that many poisoned arrow might have been warded from his bosom many an entanglement in his path cut asunder by the hand of the powerful and light and heat shed on him from high places would have made his humble atmosphere more genial and the softest heart then breathing might have lived and died with some fewer pangs nay we shall grant further and burns it is granting much that with all his pride he would have thanked even with exaggerated gratitude any one who had cordially befriended him patronage unless once cursed needed not to have been twice so at all events the poor promotion he desired in his calling might have been granted it was his own scheme therefore likelier than any other to be of service all this it might have been y it was duty our nobility to have done part of all this however did any of them or apparently attempt or wish to so much is granted against them 224 225 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https what then is the amount of their blame simply that they were men of the world and walked by the principles of such men that they treated burns other nobles and other commoners had done other poets the english did shakespeare king charles and his cavaliers did butler king philip and his grandees did cervantes men gather grapes of thorns or shall we cut down our thorns yielding only fence and haws how indeed could the nobility and gentry of his native land hold out any help to this scottish bard proud of his name and country were the nobility and gentry so much able rightly to help themselves had they not their game to preserve their borough interests to strengthen dinner therefore of various kinds to eat and give were their means more than adequate to all this business or less than adequate less than adequate in general few of them in reality were richer than burns many of them were poorer sometimes they had to wring their supplies with thumbscrews from the hard hand and in their need of guineas to forget their duty of mercy which burns was never reduced to let us pity and forgive them the game they preserved and shot the dinners they ate and gave the borough interests they strengthened the little babylon they severally builded by the glory of their might are all melted or melting back into the primeval chaos man merely selﬁsh endeavors are fated to and here was an action extending in virtue of its worldly inﬂuence we may say through all virtue of its moral nature beyond all time being immortal the spirit of goodness itself this action was offered them to and light was not given them to it let us pity and forgive them but better than pity let us go and otherwise human suffering did not end with the life of burns neither was the solemn mandate love one another bear one another burdens given to the rich only but to all men true we shall ﬁnd burns to relieve to assuage by our aid or pity but celestial natures groaning under the fardels of weary life we shall still ﬁnd and that wretchedness which fate has rendered voiceless and tuneless is not the least wretched but the most still we not think that the blame of burns failure lies chieﬂy with the world the world it seems to us treated him with more rather than with less kindnes s than it usually shows to such men it has ever we fear shown but small favor to its teachers hunger and nakedness perils and reviling the prison the cross the lice have in most times and countries been the it has offered wisdom the welcome with which it has greeted those who have come to enlighten and purify it homer and socrates and the christian apostles belong to old days but the world martyrology was not completed with these roger bacon and galileo languish in priestly dungeons tasso pines in the cell of madhouse camoens dies begging on the streets of lisbon so neglected so persecuted they the prophets not in judea only but in all places where men have been we reckon that every poet of burns order is or should be prophet and teacher to his he has right therefore to expect great kindness from it but rather is bound to it great burns in particular experienced fully the usual proportion of the world goodness and that the blame of his failure we have said lies not chieﬂy with the world where then does it lie we are forced to answer with himself it is his inward not his outward misfortunes that bring him to the dust seldom indeed is it is life morally wrecked but the grand cause lies in some internal some want less of good fortune than of good guidance nature fashions creature without implanting in it the strength needful its action and duration least of all does she so neglect her masterpiece and darling the poetic soul neither can we believe that it is in the power of any external circumstances utterly to ruin the mind of if proper wisdom be given him even so much to affect its essential health and beauty the sternest of all worldly misfortunes is more can lie in the cup of human woe yet many men in all ages have triumphed over death and led it captive converting its physical victory into moral victory themselves into seal and immortal consecration all that their past life had achieved what has been done may be done it is but the degree and not the kind of such heroism that differs in different seasons without some portion of this spirit not of boisterous daring but 226 227 228 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume v of 10 great britain and https silent fearlessness of in all its forms good man in any scene or time has ever attained to be good we have already stated the error of burns and mourned over it rather than blamed it it was the want of unity in his purposes of consistency in his aims the hapless attempt to mingle in friendly union the common spirit of the world with the spirit of poetry which is of far different and altogether irreconcilable nature burns was nothing wholly and burns could be man formed he was can be anything by halves the heart not of mere popular verse monger or poetical restaurateur but of true poet and singer worthy of the old religious heroic times had been given him and he fell in an age not of heroism and religion but of scepticism selﬁshness and triviality when true nobleness was little understood and its place supplied by hollow dissocial altogether barren and unfruitful principle of pride the inﬂuences of that age his open kind susceptible nature to say nothing of his highly untoward situation made it more than usually difﬁcult him to repel or resist the better spirit that was within him ever sternly demanded its rights its suprema cy he spent his life in endeavoring to reconcile these two and lost it he must have lost it without reconciling them here burns was born poor and born also to continue poor he would not endeavor to be otherwise this it had been well could he have once all admitted and considered ﬁnally settled he was poor truly but hundreds even of his own class and order of minds have been poorer yet have suffered nothing deadly from his own father had far sorer battle with ungrateful destiny than his was and he did not yield to it but died courageously warring and to all moral intents prevailing against it true burns had little means had even little time poetry his only real pursuit and vocation but so much the more precious was what little he had in all these external respects his case was hard but very far from the hardest poverty incessant drudgery and much worse evils it has often been the lot of poets and wise men to strive with and their glory to conquer locke was banished traitor and wrote his essay on the human understanding sheltering himself in dutch garret was milton rich or at his ease when he composed paradise lost not only low but fallen from height not only poor but impover ished in darkness and

its epic written without even the aid of paper on scraps of leather the stout ﬁghter and voyager snatched any moment from that wild warfare and what then had these men which burns wanted two things both which it seems to us are indispensable such men they had true religious principle of mora ls and single not double aim in their activity they were not and but seekers and worshippers of something far better than self not personal enjoyment was their object but high heroic idea of religion of patriotism of heavenly wisdom in one or the other form ever hovered before them in which cause they neither shrunk from suffering nor called on the earth to witness it something wonderful but patiently endured counting it blessedness enough so to spend and be spent thus the golden calf of however curiously carved was not their deity but the invisible goodness which alone is man reasonable service this feeling was celestial fountain whose streams refreshed into gladness and beauty all the provinces of their other wise too desolate existence in word they willed one thing to which all other things were subordinated and made subservient and therefore they accomplished it the wedge will rend rocks but its edge must be sharp and single if it be double the wedge is bruised doubtless there was remedy this perverseness but not in in himself least of all in simple increase of wealth and worldly respectability we hope we have now heard enough about the efﬁcacy of wealth poetry and to make poets happy nay have we not seen another instance of it in these very days byron man of an endowment considerably less ethereal than that of burns is born in the rank not of scottish ploughman but of an english peer the highest worldly honors the fairest worldly career are his by

on the surface he that runs may read them nor have there been wanting attentive and malicious observers to point them out many years after the restoration they were the theme of unmeasured invective and derision they were exposed to the utmost licentiousness of the press and of the stage at the time when the press and the stage were most licentious they were not men of letters they were body unpopular they could not defend themselves and the public would not take them under its protection they were therefore abandoned without reserve to the tender mercies of the satirists and dramatists

caskets which contain only the death head and the fool head and ﬁx on the plain leaden chest which conceals the treasure the puritans were men whose minds had derived peculiar character from the daily contemplation of superior beings and eternal interests not content with acknowledging in general terms an overruling provide nce they habitually ascribed every event to the will of the great being whose power nothing was too vast whose inspection nothing was too minute to know him to serve him to enjoy him was with them the greatest end of existence they rejecte d with contempt the ceremonious homage other sects substituted the pure worship of the soul instead of catching occasional glimpses of the deity through an obscuring veil they aspired to gaze full on his intolerable brightness and to commune with him face to face hence originated their contempt terrestrial distinctions the difference between the greatest and the meanest of mankind seemed to vanish when compared with the boundless interval which separated the whole race from him on whom their own eyes were constantly ﬁxt they recognized title to superiority but his favor and conﬁdent of that favor they despised all the accomplishments and all the dignities of the world if they were unacquainted with the works of philosophers and poets they were deeply read in the oracles of god if their names were not found in the registers of heralds they were recorded in the book of life if their steps were not accompanied by splendid train of menials legions of ministering angels had charge over them their palaces were houses not made with hands their diadems crowns of glory which should never fade away on the rich and the eloquent on nobles and priests they looked down with contempt they esteemed themselves rich in

and darkness looked with anxious interest who had been destined before heaven and earth were created to enjoy felicity which should continue when heaven and earth should have passed away events which shortsighted politicians ascribed to earthly causes had been ordained on his account his sake empires had risen and ﬂourished and decayed thus the puritan was made up of two different men the one all penitence gratitude passion the other proud calm inﬂexible sagacious he prostrated himself in the dust before his maker but he set his foot on the neck of his king in his devotional retirement he prayed with convulsions and groans and tears he was maddened by glorious or terrible illusions he heard the lyres of angels or the tempting whispers of ﬁends he caught gleam of the beatiﬁc vision or awoke screaming from dreams of everlasting ﬁre like vane he thought himself intrusted with the scepter of the millennial year like fleetwood he cried in the bitterness of his soul that god had hidden his face from him but when he took his seat in the council or girt on his swor d war these tempestuous workings of the soul had left perceptible trace behind them people who saw nothing of the godly but their uncouth visages and heard nothing from them but their groans and their whining hymns might laugh at them but those had little reason to laugh who encountered them in the hall of debate or in the ﬁeld of battle these fanatics brought to civil and military affairs coolness of judgment and immutability of purpose which some writers have though t inconsistent with their religious zeal but which were in fact the necessary effects of it the intensity of their feelings on one subject made them tranquil on every other one overpowering sentiment had subjected to itself pity and hatred ambition and fear death had lost its terrors and pleasure its charms they had their smiles and their tears their raptures and their sorrows but not the things of this world enthusiasm had made them stoics had cleared their minds from every vulgar passion and prejudice and raised them above the inﬂuence of danger and of corruption it sometimes might lead them to pursue unwise ends but never to choose unwise means they went through the world like sir artegal iron man talus with his ﬂail crushing and trampling down oppressors mingling with human beings but having neither part nor lot in human inﬁrmities insensible to fatigue to pleasure and to pain not to be pierced by any weapon nor to be withstood by any barrier such we believe to have been the character of the puritans we perceive the absurdity of their manners we dislike the sullen gloom of their domestic habits we acknowledge that the tone of their minds was often injured by straining after things too high mortal reach and we know that in spite of their hatred of popery they too often fell into the worst vices of that bad system intolerance and extravagant austerity that they had their anchorites and their crusades their

any but the humblest class of english laborers from their calling barrier almost impassable separates him from the commissioned ofﬁcer the great majority of those who rise high in the service rise by purchase so numerous and extensive are the remote dependencies of england that every man who enlists in the line must expect to pass many years in exile and some years in climates unfavorable to the

commands the ranks were accordingly composed of persons superior in station and education to the multitude these persons sober moral diligent and accustomed to reﬂect had been induced to take up arms not by the pressure of want not by the love of novelty and license not by the arts of recruiting ofﬁcers but by religious and political zeal mingled with the desire of distinction and promotion the boast of the soldiers we ﬁnd it recorded in their solemn resolutions was that they had not been forced into the service nor had enlisted chieﬂy the sake of lucre that they were janizaries but englishmen who had of their own accord put their lives in jeopardy the liberties and religion of england and whose right and duty it was to watch over the welfare of the nation which they had saved force thus composed might without injury to its efﬁciency be indulged in some liberties which if allowed to any other troops would have proved subversive of all discipline in general soldiers who should form themselves into political clubs elect delegates and pass resolutions on high questions of state would soon break loose from all control would cease to form an army and would become the worst and most dangerous of mobs nor would it be safe in our time to tolerate in any regiment religious meetings at which corporal versed in scripture should lead the devotions of his less gifted colonel and admonish backsliding major but such was the intelligence the gravity and the of the warriors whom cromwell had traine d that in their camp political organization and religious organization could exist without destroying military organization the same men who off duty were noted demagogs and were distinguished by steadiness by the spirit of order and by prompt obedience on watch on drill

troops moved to victory with the precision of machines while burning with the wildest fanaticism of crusaders from the time when the army was remodeled to the time when it was disbanded it never found either in the british islands or on the continent an enemy who could stand its onset in england scotland ireland flanders the puritan warriors often surrounded by difﬁculties sometimes contending against threefold odds not only never failed to conquer but never failed to destroy and break in pieces whatever force was opposed to them they at length came to regard the day of battle day of

emotion of national pride when they saw brigade of their countrymen outnumbered by foes and abandoned by friends drive before it in headlong rout the ﬁnest infantry of spain and force passage into counterscrap which had just been pronounced impregnable by the ablest of the marshals of france but that which chieﬂy distinguished the army of cromwell from other armies was the austere morality and the fear of god which pervaded all ranks it is acknowledged by the most zealous royalists that in that singular camp oath was heard drunkenness or gambling was seen and that during the long dominion of the soldiery the property of the peaceable citizen and the honor of woman were held sacred if outrages were committed they were outrages of very different kind from those of which victoriou s army is generally guilty complained of the rough gallantry of the redcoats not an ounce of plate was taken from the shops of the goldsmiths but pelagian sermon or window on which the virgin and the child

the plantagenets on an englishman accused of exercising tyranny over the lord of the holy city of benares and over the ladies of the princely house of oude the place was worthy of such trial it was the great hall of william rufus the hall which had resounded with acclamations at the inauguration of thirty kings the hall which had witnessed the just sentence of bacon and the just absolution of somers the hall where the eloquence of straf ford had moment awed and melted victorious party inﬂamed with just resentment the hall where charles had confronted the high court of justice with the

science and of every art there were seated round the queen the young daughters of the house of brunswick there the ambassadors of great kings and commonwealths gazed with admiration on spectacle which other country in the world could present there siddons in the prime of her majestic beauty looked with emotion on scene surpassing all the imitations of the stage there the historian of the roman

spectacle had allured reynolds from that easel which has preserved to us the thoughtful foreheads of so many writers and statesmen and the sweet smiles of so many noble matrons it had induced parr to suspend his labors in that dark and profo und mine from which he had extracted vast treasure of erudition treasure too often buried in the earth too often paraded with injudicious and inelegant ostentation but still precious massive and splendid there appeared the voluptuous charms of her to whom the heir of the throne had in secret plighted his faith there too was she the beautiful mother

neither the culprit nor his advocates attracted so much notice the accuse rs in the midst of the blaze of red drapery space had been ﬁtted up with green benches and tables the commons the managers with burke at their head appeared in full dress the collectors of gossip did not fail to remark that even fox generally so regardless of his appearance had paid to the illustrious tribunal the compliment of wearing bag and sword pitt had refused to be one of the conductors of the impeachment and his commanding copious and sonorous eloquence was wanting to that great muster of various talents age and blindness had unﬁtted lord north the duties of public prosecutor and his friends were left without the help of his excellent sense his tact and his urbanity but in spite of the absence of these two distinguished members of the lower house the box in which the managers stood contained an array of speakers such perhaps had not appeared together since the great age of athenian eloquence there were fox and sheridan the english demosthenes and the english hyperides there was burke indeed or negligent of the art of adapting his reasonings and his style to the capacity and taste of his hearers but in amplitude of comprehension and richness of imagination superior to every orator ancient or modern there with eyes reverentially ﬁxt on burke appeared the ﬁnest gentleman of the age his form developed by every manly exercise his face beaming with intelligence and ingenious the chivalrous the windham nor tho surrounded by such men did the youngest manager pass unnoticed at

which characterize the great works of athenian genius we must pronounce them intrins ically most valuable but what shall we say when we reﬂect that from these had sprung directly or indirectly all the noblest creations of the human intellect that from hence were the vast accomplishments and the brilliant fancy of cicero the withering ﬁre of juvenal the plastic imagination of dante the humor of cervantes the comprehension of bacon the wit of butler the supreme and universal excellence of shakespeare all the triumphs of truth and genius over prejudice and power in every country and in every age have been the triumphs of athens wherever few great minds have made stand against violence and fraud in the cause of liberty and reason there has been her spirit in the midst of them inspiring encouraging the lonely lamp of erasmus by the restless bed of pascal in the tribune of mirabeau in the cell of galileo on the scaffold of sidney but who shall estimate her inﬂuence on private happi ness who shall say how many thousands have been made wiser happier and better by those pursuits in which she has taught mankind to engage to how many the studies which took their rise from her have been wealth in in in in solitude her power is indeed manifested at the bar in the senate in the ﬁeld of battle in the schools of philosophy but these are not her glory wherever literature consoles sorrow or assuages it brings gladness to eyes which fail with wakefulness and tears and ache the dark house and the long is exhibited in its noblest form the immortal inﬂuence of athens the dervish in the arabian tale did not hesitate to abandon to his comrade the camels with their load of jewels and gold while he retained the casket of that juice which enabled him to behold at glance all the hidden riches of the universe surel y it is exaggeration to say that external advantage is to be compared with that puriﬁcation of the intellectual eye which gives us to contemplate the inﬁnite wealth of the mental world all the hoarded treasures of the primeval dynasties all the shapeless ore of its yet unexplored mines this is the gift of athens to man her freedom and her power have more than twenty centuries been annihilated her people have degenerated into timid slaves her language into barbarous jargon her temples have been given up to the successive depredations of romans turks and scotchmen 60 but her intellectual empire is imperishable and when those who have rivaled her greatness shall have shared her fate when civilization and know ledge shall have ﬁxt their abode in distant continents when the scepter shall have passed away from england when perhaps travelers from distant regions shall in vain labor to decipher on some moldering pedestal the name of our proudest chief shall hear savage hymns chanted to some missh aped idol over the ruined dome of our proudest temple and shall see single naked ﬁsherman wash his nets in the river of the ten thousand inﬂuence and her

sprung of house ancient indeed and noble but degraded and impoveri shed by series of crimes and follies which had attained scandalous publicity the kinsman whom he succeeded had died poor and but merciful judges would have died upon the gallows the young peer had great intellectual powers yet there was an unsound part in his mind he had naturally genero us and tender heart but his temper was irritable and wayward he had head which statuaries loved to copy and foot the deformity of which the beggars in the street mimicked distinguished at once by the strength and by the weakness of his intellect affectionate yet perverse poor lord and handsome cripple he required if ever man required the ﬁrmest and the most judicious training but capriciously nature had dealt with him the relative to whom the ofﬁce of forming his character was entrusted was more capricious still she passed from paroxysms of rage to paroxysms of fondness at one time she stiﬂed him with her caresses at another time she insulted his deformity he came into the world and the world treated him his mother treated with kindness sometimes with severity never with justice it indulged him without discrimination and punished him without discrimination he was truly spoilt child not merely the spoilt child of his parents but the spoilt child of nature the spoilt child of fortune the spoilt child of fame the spoilt child of society his ﬁrst poems 62 were received with contempt which feeble they were they did not absolutely deserve the poem which he published on his returns from his travels 63 was on the other hand extolled far above its merits at he found himself on the highest pinnacle of literary fame with scott wordsworth southey and crowd of other distinguished writers beneath his feet there is scarcely an instance in history of so sudden rise to so dizzy an eminence everything that could stimulate and everything that could gratify the strongest propensibilities of our gaze of hundred the acclamations of the whole nation the applause of applauded men the love of the loveliest this world and the glory of it were at once offered to young man to whom nature had given violent passions and whom education had never taught to control them he lived many men live who have similar excuses to plead his faults but his countrymen and his countrywomen would love him and admire him they were resolved to see in his excesses only the ﬂash and outbreak of the same ﬁery mind which glowed in his poetry he attacked religion yet in religious circles his name was mentioned with fondness and in many religious publications his works were censured with singular tende rness he lampooned the prince regent yet he could not alienate the tories everything it seems was to be given to youth rank and

in its fondness ﬂew into rage with its froward and petted darling he had been worshiped with an irrational idolatry he was persecuted with an irrational fury much has been written about those unhappy domestic occurrences which decided the fate of his life yet nothing ever was positively known to the public but he quarreled with his lady and that she refused to live with him there have been hints in abundance and shrugs and shakings of the head and well well we know and we could if we would and if we list to speak and there be that might an they list but we are not aware that there is before the world substantiated by credible or even by tangible evidence single fact indicating that lord byron was more to blame than any other man who is on bad terms with his wife the professional men whom lady byron consulted were undoubtedly of the opinion that she ought not to live with her husband but it is to be remembered that they formed that opinion without hearing both sides we not say we not mean to insinuate that lady byron was in any respect to blame we think that those who condemn her on the evidence which is now before the public are rash those who condemn her husband we will not pronounce any judgment we can not even in our own minds form any judgment on transaction which is so imperfectly known to us it would have been well if at the time of the separation all those who knew little about the matter then we know about it now had shown that forbearance which under such circumstances is but common justice we know spectacle so ridiculous the british public in one of its periodical lifts of morality in general elopements divorces and family quarrels pass with little notice we read the scandal talk about it day and forget it but once in six or seven years our virtue becomes outrageous we can not suffer the laws of religion and decency to be violated we must make stand against vice we must teach libertines that the english people appreciate the importance of domestic ties accordingly some unfortunat man in respect more depraved than hundreds whose offenses have been treated with lenity is singled out an expiatory sacriﬁce if he has children they are to be taken from him if he has profession he is to be driven from it he is cut by the higher orders and hissed by the lower he is in truth sort of by whose vicarious agonies all the other transgressors of the same class are it is supposed sufﬁciently chastised we reﬂect very complacently on our own severity and compare with great pride the high standard of morals established in england with the parisian laxity at length our anger is satiated our victim is ruined and and our virtue goes quietly to sleep seven years more it is clear that those vices which destroy domestic happiness ought to be much possible represt it is equally clear that they can not be represt by penal legislation it is therefore right and desirable that public opinion should be directed against them but it should be directed against them uniformly steadily and temperately not by sudden ﬁts and starts there should be one weight and one measure declamation is always an objectionable mode of punishment it is the resource of judges too indolent and hasty to investigate facts and to discriminate nicely between shades of guilt it is an irrational practise even when adopted by military tribunals when adopted by the tribunal of public opinion it is inﬁnitely more irrational it is good that certain portion of disgra ce should constantly attend on certain bad actions but it is not good that the offenders merely have to stand the risks of lottery of infamy that out of every hundre d should escape and that the hundredth perhaps the most innocent of the hundred should pay all we can not even now retrace those

long train of coaches turn slowly northward leaving behind it that cemetery which had been consecrated by the dust of so many great poets but of which the doors were closed against all that remained
