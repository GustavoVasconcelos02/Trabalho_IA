university press cambridge the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https reviewer and my dear readers i have been asked to say few words to you before you get busy with my little book that is ﬁlled with cheerful americans going out automobile rides generation or two ago there was poor writer i mean poor in this world s goods of course and he saw people riding about in automobiles if they owned them and it made him wish he could ride about in one if he owned it but he lacked the nerve so he had to be content with trolleys after while he made believe that he had bought an automobile and he rode around in it with araminta and enjoyed the motion so much that he set others to riding in automobiles that he made himself in his study and he was much pleased at the way they after while he made collection of these stories and they went some more and now they are off cross country trip that will undoubtedly result in the critics saying of the writer he has the pen of charles dickens or he reminds one of robert louis stevenson at his best or he succeeds man since sir walter scott has succeeded in writing automobile stories that cause the helpless and fascinated reader to sit up all night regardless of anything save the ﬂight of the machine or perhaps they will say the mantle of bret harte has fallen upon him and with the possible exception of nathaniel hawthorne one has written such tales of the clutch and brake and sparker readers need i tell you who that poor writer was the poor boy who in 1865 had never even seen an automobile stands before you and his name is charles b attell l oomis the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https ontents page aramint and the utomobile 9 the d eception

those who expended it on charity none of these forms of getting away with money appealed to araminta and myself soon it was ascertained that the automobile was practicable and would not cost king s ransom i determined to devote my savings to the purchase of one araminta and i live in suburban town she because she loves nature and i because i love araminta we have been married ﬁve years i am bank clerk in new york and morning and night i go through the monotony of railway travel and one who is forbid den to use his eyes on the train and who does not play cards it is monotony in the morning my friends are either playing cards or else reading their papers and one does not like to urge the claims of conversation on one who is deep in politics or the next play of his antagonist so my getting to business and coming back are in the nature of purgatory i therefore hailed the automobile means of swift motion with an agreeable companion and with danger of encountering either newspapers or cards i have seen neither reading nor going on in any automobile the community in which i live is not progressive and when i said that i expected to buy an automobile soon my ship came in i was frowned upon by my neighbors several of them have horses and all or nearly all have feet the horsemen were not more opposed to my proposed ownership than the should say pedestrians they all thought automobiles dangerous and menace to public peace but of course i poohed their fears and being person of good deal of stability of purpose i went on saving my money and in course of time i bought an automobile of the electric sort 11 12 13 14 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https young man experience teaches mor in half an hour than books or precepts in year araminta is plucky and i am perfectly fearless when the automobile was brought home and housed in the little barn that is on our property the man who had backed it in told that he had orders to stay and show how it worked but i laughed at naturedly yet ﬁrmly i said young man experience teaches more in half an hour than books or precepts in year newspaper man does not go to school of journalism if he is wise he gets position on newspaper and learns himself and through his mistakes i know that one of these levers is to steer by that another lets loose the power and that there is i also know that the machine is charged and i need to know more thus did i speak to the young man and he saw that i was person of force and discretion and he withdrew to the train and i never saw him again araminta had been to passaic shopping but she came back while i was out in the barn looking at my new purchase and she joined there i looked at her lovingly and she returned the look our joint ambition was realized we were the owners of an automobile and we were going out that afternoon why is it that cheap barns are so ﬂimsily built i know that our barn is cheap because the rent house and barn is less than what many clerk city pent pays cram ped ﬂat but again i ask why are they ﬂimsily built i have complaint to make if my barn had been built of good stout oak i might be in hospital 15 16 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https happened this way araminta said let get in and we will take just little ride to see how it goes and i out of my love her said wait just few minutes dearest until i get the hang of the thing i want to see how much go she has and just how she araminta has learned to obey my slightest word knowing that love is at the bottom of all my commands and she stepped to one side while i entered the gayly painted vehicle and tried to move out of the barn i moved out but i backed oh blessed cheaply built barn my way was not restricted to any appreciable extent i shot gayly through the barn into the hen yard and the sound of the ripping clapboards frightened the silly hens who were enjoying and they ﬂed in more directions than there were fowls i had not intended entering the hen yard and i did not wish to stay there so i kept on out the wire netting not being what an autom obile would call an obstruction i never lose my head and when i heard araminta screaming in the barn i called out cheerily to her i ll be back in minute dear but i m coming another way and i did come another way i came all sorts of ways i really don t know what got into the machine but she now turned to the left and made the road and then she ran along on her two left wheels moment and then seemed about to turn somersault but changed her mind and still veering to the left kept on up the road passing my house at furious speed and making the open country with much calmness i could summon i steered her but i think i steered her little too much she turned toward my house i reached one end of the front piazza at the same time that araminta reached the other end of it i had the right of way and she deferred to just in time i removed the vestibule storm door it was late in march and i did not think we should have any more use it that season and we didn i had ordered strongly built machine and i was now glad of it because light and weak affair that was merely meant to run along on level and unobstructed road would not have stood the assault on my piazza why my piazza did not stand it it caved in and made work an already overworked local carpenter who was with his orders after i had passed through the vestibule i applied the brake and it worked the path is not cinder one i think them untidy so i was not more than muddied i was up in an instant and looked at the still enthusiastic machine with admiration have you got the hang of it said araminta now that s one thing i like about araminta she does not waste words over essentials the point was not that i had damaged the piazza i needed new one anyway the main thing was that i was trying to get the hang of the machine and she recognized that fact instantly i told her that i thought i had and that if i had pushed the lever in the right way at ﬁrst i should have come out of the barn in more conventional way she again asked to let her ride and i now felt that i could better cope with the curves of the machine i allowed her to get in don t lose your head said i i hope i sha n t said she dryly well if you have occasion to leave drop over the back never jump ahead that is fundamental rule in runaways of all then we started and i ran the motor along upward of half mile after i had reached the highway which i did by short cut through ﬁeld at the side of our house there is only slight rail fence surrounding it and my machine made little of that it really seemed to delight in what some people would have called danger araminta are you glad that i saved up this 17 18 19 20 21 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https i am mad with joy said the dear thing her face ﬂushed with excitement mixed with expectancy nor were her expectations to be disappointed we still had good deal to before we should have ended our ﬁrst ride so far i had damaged property to certain extent but i had one but myself to reckon with and i was providing work people i always have claimed that he who makes work two men where there was only work one before is public benefactor and that day i was the friend of carpenters and other mechanics along the highway we ﬂew our hearts beating high but never in our mouths and at last we saw team approaching us by team i mean horse and buggy i was raised in connecticut where team is anything you choose to call one the teamster saw us well perhaps i should not call him teamster although he was one logically he was our doctor and i say he saw us now i think it would have been friendly in him seeing that i was more or less of novice at the art of automobiling to have turne d to the left when he saw that i was inadvertently turning to the left but the practice of forty years added to certain native obstinacy made him turn to the right and he met at the same time that i met him the horse was not hurt which i am truly glad and the doctor joined us and continued with us season but his buggy was demolished of course i am always prepared to pay my pleasure and though it was not strictly speaking my pleasure to deprive my physician of his yet if he had turned out it wouldn t have i say i was prepared to get him new vehicle but he was very unreasonable so much so that he was crowding the seat was not built more than two and he is at last told him that i intended to turn around and carry him home we were out pleasure and he was giving us pain i will confess that the events of the last few minutes had rattled somewhat and i did not feel like turning just then the road was narrow i knew that the road turned of its own accord farther on and so i determined to wait i want to get out said the doctor tartly and just he said so araminta stepped on the brake accidentally the doctor got in front with great presence of mind i reversed and so we did not run over him but he was furious and sulphurous and that is why i have changed to homeopathy he was the only allopathic doctor in brantford i suppose that if i had stopped and apologized he would have made up with and i would not have got angry with him but i couldn t stop the machine was now going she had done when i left the barn and we were backing into town through it all i did not lose my coolness i said araminta look out behind which is ahead us and if you have occasion to jump now it in front which is behind and araminta understood she sat sideways so that she could see what was going on but that might have been seen from any point of view we were the only things going backing pretty soon we passed the wreck of the buggy and then we saw the horse grazin g on dead grass by the roadside and at last we came on few of our townfolk who had seen us start and were now come out to welco us home but i did not go home just then i should have done so if the machine had minded and turned in at our drivew ay but it did not across the way from us there is ﬁne lawn leading up to beautiful greenhou full of rare orchids and other plants it is the pride of my very good neighbor jacob rawlinson the machine if moved by malice prepense turned just we came to the lawn and began to back at railroad speed i told araminta that if she was tired of riding now was the best time to stop that she ought not to overdo it and that i was going to get out myself soon i had seen her off 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https saw her of then after one ineffectual jab at the brake i left the machine hurriedly and i sat down on the sposhy lawn i heard tremendous but not unmusical sound of falling glass i tell araminta that it isn t the running of an automobile that is expensive it is the stopping of the project

by charles battell loomis https deception of mar tha tucker an aut omobile extra vaganza i t was not that martha tucker was particularly fond of horses so much that she was afraid of automobiles of every sort kind or description that was why she said that she would never consent to her husband s purchasing motor carriage horses were good enough my father and i guess that horses will long i live and john is able to keep them said she to various friends on numerous occasions but if she was ridiculously in her notions john was not and he cast about in his mind some way to circumvent martha without her knowing it the thing would have been easy to if it had not been the fact that they were very loving couple john seldom went anywhere without taking his wife along and his business was of such nature that he carried it on under his he was unable to speed along in happy loneliness on locomobile or electric motor besides all this john tucker s conscience was such peculiar affair that if he hoodwinked martha it must be in her sight the tuckers always spent their summ ers at arlinber g the roads around which were famous driving and almost their only recreation aside from wandering afoot in the ﬁelds was found in riding behind any one or two of his horses the fact that he was abundantly able to maintain the most expensive automobile extant made it doubly hard john to abstain from the use of one i gave up smoking to please martha when we ﬁrst married but i not intend to give up the idea of running an automobile of my own just because she has the y notions of the hiltons in her blood her father never rode in although the road passed by his back door and all the hiltons are sums up their john said this to an old who was spending sunday at his house wouldn t she try one of your neighbor s automobiles and see how she likes it sir her is but i mean to ride in one with her sometime if i have to blindfold her and tell her it s it may have been week after this conversation that john and martha wander ed in the woods picking wild ﬂowers and tucker was inoculated with that settled in her eyes so that several days she was conﬁned to her room and when she came out she was told by her doctor to wear smoked glasses week or two her eyes still being inﬂamed and very painful keep outdoors go riding much you can but don t take of f the glasses until the inﬂammation has entirely subsided said he john was sincerely sorry his wife s misfortune but when he heard that she would see through glass darkly the matter of week or two he made up his mind to act and act quickly they went out ride that he might test her vision the horse he was driving was gray roanoke by name my dear said tucker don t you think that the gait of this black horse is very like that of roanoke i m sure i can t tell said martha with these dismal glasses on i m not quite sure whether it s horse or cow in the harness i get hazy outline of some animal but color and little form don t ever touch if you value your 31 32 33 34 35 36 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https well the doctor says you ll be all right in week or two by the way martha i m going to run down to new york on business i ll be back in the evening if your eyes were all right you might come along but it is i guess you d better not go driving around with james will more good than stuffy train come home soon you can dear she hesitated i hate the old things but if you are so set on trying one of those automobiles why don t you it when you are in new york why i believe i will my dear i wish i could overcome your prejudice against but you can t dear so don t when tucker reached new york the ﬁrst thing that he did was to visit an automobile repository would it be possible you to let have an automobile that could be operated from behind so that my wife and i could sit in front and simply enjoy the ride why certainly said the man we have every style known to the most advanced and could i have shafts attached to it so that if it broke down i could call in the services of some horse but sir our machines never break down that is why we are selling one every minute in the our agents are locat ed in every known city of the earth and our factories are running day and night and in spite of it we are falling behind in our orders in rapidly increasing is that so said tucker turning to leave the store then i m afraid i ll have to go elsewhere i wanted one shipped to or next day birthday present my wife you oh i suppose said the wily salesman that i could let you in ahead of your turn if the payment were of course the payment will be cash that s the only way i ever pay from that time john tucker was being propelled through new york s busy streets in smoothly running almost noiseless automobile worked from behind and its way led down to harness store in chambers street yet there were shafts but he had provided pair tucker went into the said he i want to buy wooden horse like the one out in front only covered with well sir said the clerk we don t manufacture them ourselves but we can order one you going into the harness business but i want to try an experiment would it be possible to have mechanical horse built that would move its legs in passable imitation of trotting nowadays everything is possible said the salesman but it would be very well i ll tell you just what i want it said tucker and entered into details concerning tucker s aversion to automobiles her and his scheme the clerk seemed interested if the lady s eyes are inﬂamed all that said he she would not notice the lack of natural motion and it would be easy to place contrivance inside of the ﬁgure that would imitate the sound of trotting and your wife s imagination would the rest but i think that your idea of having the horse on platform like the one out front is not good one if the platform struck rock in the road it would knock the whole thing to smithereens better place smallish wheels on the inner side of the ankles ﬁx the hind legs so they will be jointed at the thighs and then you can run up hill and down dale with 37 38 39 40 41 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https tucker clapped his hands like boy that s ﬁne my wife will get thorou ghly used to an automobile without knowing she is riding in one and then when she recovers the use of her eyes i ll give the wooden horse rest call up that factory on the phone and i ll order my at once you think that i can get it in day or two it s only question of expense sir and you say that is of course it s nothing nothing is anything if i can take my wife out automobiling without her knowing three days later mr tucker said to his wife at luncheon my dear this is your birthday i have given myself the pleasure of buying you new horse and wagon and it will be ready us to go out in half an hour oh you dear thoughtful man said tucker beaming well she was able to through her smoked glasses then she rose and gave him kiss that made him feel that he was guilty wretch to be meditating the deception of such lovable wife but he had gone too far to retrace his steps now and he eased his feelings with the thought that the end would justify the means you are always doing things to please said she such thing he replied you may not like this horse well you like roanoke or charley but it is quite swagger and i ve decided to have james go with us and sit behind on the oh but my dear we will not be driving alone if he is with nonsense we ve been married twenty years and anyhow james is graven image he will not know we are he will be too busy running the thing added tucker mentally 42 43 44 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https appr oached the horse s head to pet him later tucker announced to his wife that he was ready and she put few ﬁnishing touches to her toilet bathed her eyes with adjusted her smoked glasses and went out to the she dimly discerned the horse the wagon the groom at the horse s head and her husband there was an indescribably swagger look about the equipage and she wished that she could take off her glasses and gloat over her new possession but the doctor s orders had been imperative she did however approach the horse s head to pet him but her husband said don t dear he may not like women wait until he is used to us before you try to coddle they stepped to their seats the groom left the horse s head and handed the reins to tucker mounted the rumble and of f they started why it s like sailing said tucker pneumatic tires my dear answered her husband glibly and how rhythmical the horse s are 45 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https an evidence of blood my darling i know this horse s pedigree by carpenter out of oh don t i never cared those long genealogies whether he has blood or not he is certainly the smoothest traveller i ever saw they had been skilfully guided along the winding path that led to the highway by the chauf feur who although he was james was not the james who generally worked in the stable but james hired at the ofﬁce of the company in order that he might break in the local james after they reached the road the way mile or more was clear and straight and they met with teams the horse was wond erfully lifelike except in his action or rather lack of action his forefeet were eternally in an attitude of rest the hind legs rose and fell with the inequalities of the road and his mane and tail waved in the breeze like the real horsehair that they were this is the poetry of motion said tucker i don t believe you ll ever ﬁnd an automobile that can run like i ll admit that i wouldn t wish one to go better are you all right back there james all right sir why how queer james voice sounds i never noticed that squeak in it it s the exhilarating effect of our fast driving you think that you could stand faster pace why if you re not afraid of tiring the horse he seems to be going like the wind now oh he won t mind faster why you say that to james did you think he was driving you dear you i did the james was sure he was driving and at this command from his employer he put on almost the full force of the electricity the wagon gave leap forward and turning into macadamized road at this point they went along at the rate of twenty miles an hour tucker clutched her husband s arm john his speed is uncanny we seem to be going like an it s the smoothness of the road and his perfect breeding my dear you notice that this furious gait does not seem to af fect his wind at all i hadn t noticed it but isn t it queer how regular his are and they not seem to quicken their rate at john had noticed this too and he had regretted not having told the manufacturer to arrange the mechanism so that the would become more or less rapid according to the gait but he answered quickly that my dear is because he reaches farther and farther you know some breeds of horses gain speed by quickening their gait this horse gains it by lengthened reach he is remarkable animal actually my dear we are overtaking oh john is he used to these horrid nothing will frighten this horse martha you can rest assured of minute later they passed the locomobile if tucker could have seen the codﬁsh eyes of the occupant of the vehicle when he saw going by at the rate of twenty miles an hour she would have questioned his sanity if she could have seen the scared looks and the scared horse of the people in the approaching buggy she would have begun to wonder what possessed her new possession but her goggles saved her from present worry and the buggy was passed in ﬂash 46 47 48 49 50 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https oh i wish i could take off my glasses minute so that i could enjoy this rapid motion to the full how the trees must be spinning by don t touch your glasses said tucker hurriedly if speck of dust or pebble were to get into your eye you might become permanently blind positively you are like child with new this will keep until your eyes are fully recovered and i hope we may enjoy many spin in this easy carriage with or without this never without him dear after the delight of this swift motion i never would go back to lazy roanoke or skittish charley i have never ridden in any carriage that pleased like this she s convert already without knowing it said her husband to himself but her next remark dispelled his illusion how can any one like noisy automob ile better than this you can t improve on nature by the way i got to ask you if you rode in one the other day in new to be sure i didn t tell you did i it was really almost nice this although the trafﬁc impeded us some oh james look out this interruption was involuntary on the part of tucker and his words were not noticed by his wife in the confusion of that which followed they were going down hill at fearful rate when the off foreleg of the wooden horse became veritable off foreleg it hit log of wood that had droppe d from teamster s cart not ﬁve minutes before and broke off at the knee the jar almost threw tucker out she grasped the dashboard to save herself and caugh t momentary glimpse of the oddly working haunches of the imitation beast oh john he s running away now this was not quite accurate he was being pushed away by runaway automobile mr tucker noticed the increased speed and turned to admonish james james had left the departure of james was coincident with the collision and he was at that moment extricating himself from sapling into which he had been pitched he yelled directions to tucker which lacked carrying power the vehicle had now come to turn in the road and not receiving any impulse to the contrary it made stone wall that lay before it tucker knew nothing about the working of the machine but with admirable presence of mind he seized projecting rod and the wagon turned to the left with prompt obedience but so suddenly that it ran upon two wheels and nearly upset so far so good but now what should he to get over to the back seat was either to give the whole thing away or else make tucker question his courage he was too obstinate to disclose his secret until he should be forced to so he sat still and awaited developments developments not keep you waiting long when you are in runaway automobile and in just one minute by his watch although he did not time it the end came too late to any good john tucker jumped over the back of the seat because he saw the wooden horse again approaching stonewall beyond which lay frog pond he pulled the lever before but he could not have pulled it hard enough the next moment there was shock and then tucker sailed like sprite through the air and landed in the water like nymph while some kindling wood in horsehair skin was all that was left of mr tucker s thoroughbred tucker was not hurt by the impact he had grasped an overhanging bough and saved himself he dropped to earth vaulted stone wall and rescued the fainting ﬁgure

knew from past experiences that his wife was an easy fainter and after assuring himself that bones were broken he left her few minutes that he might run out to seek james who might be at death s door he found him gazing upon the ruins of the wooden horse upon learning that the man was uninjured he drew bill from his pocket and said my boy here s money your expenses and your wages and if there is any go in this machine run her to new york and tell your people that they can have her gift i am through with but later tucker fully conscious but somewhat weak sat up on the bed in the farmer s best chamber and said john i think that if it had been horseless automobile it wouldn t have been so whereupon john overtook james just setting out new york and gave him an order one horseless automobile and now john is convinced that his wife is thoroughbred 57 58 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https the aut omobile ran down christmas extra

discovered various reasons why he should call at the marten house once or twice week but strange habit he had of putting off delightful moments in order to enjoy anticipation to its fullest extent had caused him to refrain from disclosing the state of his heart to miss badeau and so that young woman who had fallen in love with him even before she knew that he was the gifted author of thoughts often

bed feeling white about the gills orville was most methodical man he planned his doings days ahead and seldom changed his schedule but it seemed likely that unless he was built of sterner stuff than most of the machines called men he would not run out of the his fall had given his foot nasty wrench some engineers to change the simile would have argued that the engine was off the track and that therefore the train was not in running condition but orville merely changed engines his own steam having been cut off he ordered an automobile twenty minutes to seven and after he had bathed and bandaged his ankle he determined with grit worthy of the cause that brought it forth to attend that dinner even if he paid it in the hospital with annette special nurse old nickerson who lived across the hall had heard of his misfortune and called to proffer his services shall i help you get to bed said he i am not due in bed nickerson many hours but if you will give few ﬁngers of your excellent old scotch with the bouquet of smoked herring i will go on dressing dinner dear boy said the old gentleman almost tearfully it is impossible you to venture on your foot with such sprain it is badly mr nickerson my heart has received worse wrench than my foot has therefore i go out to at sound of which enigmat ical declaration nickerson hurried off the old scotch and in few minutes orvill s faintness had passed off and with help from the amiable old man he got into his evening the exception of his left foot which was encased in ﬂowered slipper of sunset red 66 67 68 69 70 71 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https now my dear nickerson i m thousand times obliged to you and if i can get you to help hop downstairs i will wait the automobile on the front orville had been born in brooklyn where they still have i m on time so far but if orville was on time the automobile was not the driver not being methodical man and when it did come it was all the motor could to stop it it seemed restive you ought to shut off on the oats said orville gayly from his seat on the lowest step of the the picture of gentleman in immaculate evening clothes with the excep tion of somewhat rococo carpet slipper seemed to amuse some street children who were passing if they could have followed the auto they would have been even more diverted but such was not to be their fortune nickerson helped his friend into the vehicle and the driver started at lively rate fifth avenue orville lived in seventeenth street near fifth avenue marten lived on fifth avenue near fortieth street street and street were reached and passed without further incident than the fact that orville s ankle pained him almost beyond the but it is not the history of sprained ankle that i am writing if the vehicle had stopped at marten s my pen would not have been set to paper but the motor did not even pause it kept on if the harlem river were to be its next stop orville had stated the number of his destination with distinctness and he now rang the annunciator and asked the driver why he did not stop calmly in the even tones that clear persons use when they wish to inspire conﬁdence the chauf feur said don t be alarmed sir but i can t stop there s something out of kilter and i may have to run some time before i can get the hang of it there s danger long i can steer can t you slacken up in front of the house so that i can jump with that foot sir impossible and anyway i can t slacken up i think we ll stop soon i don t know when it was charged but gentleman had it before i was sent out with it it won t be long i think i ll run around the block and maybe i can stop the next orville groaned twofold reason his ankle was jumping with pain and he would lose the pleasure of taking miss badeau in to dinner it was minute past seven he sat and gazed at his carpet slipper and thought of the daintily shod feet of the adorable annette the horseless carriage wound around the block they approached the house again orville imagined that they were slackening up and he opened the door to be ready it was now three minutes past seven and dinner had begun beyond doubt the driver saw the door swing open and said don t jump sir i can t stop yet i m afraid there s good deal of run in the orville looked up at the brownstone front of the house with an agonized stare if he would pull marten to the window by the power of his eyes but marten was not in the habit of pressing her nose against the pane in an anxious search tardy guests in fact it may be asserted with conﬁdence that it is not fifth avenue custom at that moment the purée was being served to marten s guests and to pretty annette badeau who really looked disconsolate with the vacant chair beside her something has happened to orville said marten looking over her shoulder toward the hall door he is punctuality joe burton was short little man with black whiskers of the style of 76 and way of looking in the most cheerful manner upon the dark side of things dessay he s been run over said he choppily wonder anyone escapes juggernauts ought to be 72 73 74 75 76 77 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https could not repress shudder her aunt saw it and said orville will never be run over he s too but it is very singular he may have been detained by an order story said marten also with the amiable purpose of consoling annette both of the martens knew how she felt toward thornton maybe he s lying on the front sidewalk hit by sign or bitten by dog dogs ought not to be allowed in the city they only add to the dangers of metropolitan existenc jerked out mr burton in blithe tones totally unaware that his remarks might worry annette dear i wish you d send some one out to see aunt nonsense annette burton is alwa ys an alarmist but marie you might step to the front door and look down the avenue thornton is always so punctual that it is peculiar marie went to the front door and looke d down the street just thornton gesticulating wildly disappeared around the corner of fortieth street oh why didn t she come sooner said he aloud to himself at least they would know why i m late and she ll be gone before i come round again was there ever such luck oh good old horse that could stop dear old nag that would pause and not go round and round like blamed carrousel say driver isn t there any way of stopping this cursed thing can t you run it into fence or house i ll take the but i won t sir these automobiles are very powerful and one of them turned over not long since and upset the stove in it and nearly burned up the newsman but there s plenty of time it to stop i don t have to hurry that s lucky said orville i thought maybe you d have to leave alone with the thing but say she may run all night here i am due at dinner i m tired of riding this is way to spend christmas slacken up and i ll jump when i get around there i tell you i can t slacken up and she s going ten miles an hour you ll break your leg if you jump and then where ll you be i might be on their sidewalk and then you could ring their bell and they d take and have you suing the company damages oh sir i m sorry but it can t be helped the company won t char ge you the extra i don t think it will said thornto n savagely the more so his foot gave twinge of pain just then there was one in sight ma am said marie when she returned probably he had an order story and got absorbed in it and forgot us said marten but this conjecture did not seem to suit annette it did not ﬁt what she knew of his character possibly he was dropped in an elevator said burton strain on elevators particularly these electrical ones is tremendous some of have got to drop and dropping elevator is respecter of persons you and i may be in one when it drops probably he was sure i hope not but he is known to be the soul of punctu ality we must put forward some accident to account his lateness people aren t always killed in elevator accidents are they my dear mr burton said his wife i wish you would give your morbid thoughts rest don t you see that annette is sensitive some one dying every minute it s merely because she happens to know orville that his death would be unpleasant if man in the klondike were to read of it in the paper he wouldn t remember it ﬁve minutes but i don t say he was in an 78 79 80 81 82 83 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https maybe some one sent him an infernal machine christmas present may have been blown up in manhole or jumped from his window to avoid ﬂames why there are million ways to account his marie had opened the parlor windows moment before the house was warm and now there came the humming of rapidly moving automobile mingled with it they heard distinctly although faintly mr marten here i it gave them all an uncanny feeling the ﬁsh was left untouched and moment silence reigned then marten sprang from the table and ran to the front door he got there just in time to see an automobile dashing around corner and to hear distinctly articulated imprecation in the voice of orville thornton in evening clothes and marten ran to fortieth street and saw the vehicle approaching sixth avenue its occupant still hurling strong language upon the evening air marten is something of sprinter although he has passed the ﬁfty mark and he resolved to solve the mystery but before he had covered third of the block in fortieth street he saw that he could not hope to overtake the runaway automobile so he turned and ran back to the house rightly surmising that the driver would circle the block when he reached his own doorstep badly winded he saw the automobile coming full tilt up the avenue from street the rest of the diners were on the steps i think he s coming he panted the driver must be moment later they were treated to the spectacle of orville still hurling imprecations he wildly gesticulated with both arms several boys were trying to keep up with the vehicle but the pace was too swift policeman had yet discovered its rotary course orville came near the marten mansion he cried in the relieved tones of one who has been falling half an hour and at last sees ground in sight what s the matter shouted marten wonderingly the carriage instead of stopping sped along the roadway sprained foot can t walk auto out of order can t stop till i come round again awful hungry merry christmas ah ha said joe burton i told you that it was an accident sprained his foot and lost power over vehicle i don t see the connection but let us be thankful that he isn t under the wheels with broken neck or winding round and round the but what s to be done said marten he says he s hungry tell you what said burton in his explosive way put some food on plate and when the carriage comes round again i ll jump aboard and he can eat he he loves purée of celery said marten very well put some in clean l or little out of the ordinary but so is the accident and he can t help his hunger hunger is disgrace i didn t think he d ever eat soup again to tell the truth i was making up my mind whether wreath or harp would be better oh you are so morbid burton said his wife while marten told the maid to get pail and put some purée into it 84 85 86 87 88 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https dr opped upon his bed feeling white about the gills when thornton came around again he met mr marten near street open the door orville and joe burton will get aboard with some soup you must be there s nothing like exercise gettin g up an appetite i ll be ready burton said orville wfully sorry i can t stop and talk but i ll see you again in minute or he opened the door he spoke and then to the great delight of at least score of people who had realized that the automobile was running away the rubicund and stout joe burton pail of purée in one hand and some table cutlery and silverware and napkin in the other made dash at the vehicle and with help from orville ef fected an entrance merry christmas said orville merry christmas awfully sorry old man but it might be worse better drink it out of the pail they gave knife and fork but they neglected to put in spoon or dish i thought that you were probably killed but i never imagined this miss badeau was terribly worked up i think that she had decided on white carnations nice girl you could easily jump old man if you hadn t sprained your foot hurt much 89 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https like the devil but i m glad it worried miss badeau i don t mean that but you know yes i know said burton with sociable smile mrs marten told nice girl let her in next time unusual thing you know people are very apt to jump from runaway vehicle but it seldom takes up passengers let her get in and you can explain matters to her you see she sails early in the morning and you haven t much time you can tell her what nice fellow you are you know and i m sure you ll have marten s blessing here s where i get with an agility admirable in one of his stoutness burton leaped to the street and ran up the steps to speak to miss badeau orville could see her blush but there was time her to become passenger that trip and the young man once more made the circuit of the block quite alone but strangely happy he had never ridden with annette except once on the elevated road and then both mr and marten were of the company round sped the motor and when the martens appeared in sight annette was on the sidewalk with covered dish in her hand and look of excited expectancy on her face that added hundredfold to its charms here you ten cents ride merry christmas shouted orville gayly and leaned half out of the automobile to catch her it was daring almost an impossible jump yet annette made it without accident and ﬂushed and excited sat down in front of thornton without spilling her burden which proved to be sweetbreads miss i hadn t expected it to turn out this way but of course your aunt doesn t care or she wouldn t have let you come we re really in danger this driver has had more experience dodging teams in this last hour than he d get in an ordinary year they tell you re going to europe early to leave all your friends now i ve something very important to say to you before you go thanks i don t want anything more that purée was very ﬁlling i ve sprained my ankle and i need to be very quiet week or two perhaps until this machine runs down but at the end of that time would orville hesitated and annette blushed sweetly she set the sweetbreads down upon the seat beside her orville had never looked so handsome before to her eyes he hesitated go on said she would you be willing to go to paris on bridal trip annette s answer was drowned in the hurrah of the driver the automobile gradually slackening came to full stop in front of the martens but orville read her lips and he handed his untouched sweetbreads to burton and his sweetheart to her uncle his face wore seraphically happy expression and when marten and the driver helped him up the steps at precisely eight clock annette s hand sought his and it was jolly party that sat down to big though somewhat rhode island turkey marriage also is an accident said mr burton the university press cambridge transcriber s note 90 91 92 93 94 the project gutenberg ebook of araminta and the automobile by charles battell loomis https
