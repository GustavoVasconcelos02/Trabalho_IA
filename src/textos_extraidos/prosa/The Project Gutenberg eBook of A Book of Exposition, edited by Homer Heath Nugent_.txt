another feature is worthy of mention although the material covers so wide anatomy zoölogy physics psychology and applied the collection will appeal to instructors in every type of college and

deals with another organism in nature the second and fourth selections deal with kindred aspects of modern manufacture of paper and the linotype machine by which it is used the ﬁfth selection is protest against certain developments of the industrial regime the last an attempt to reconcile the spirit of science with that of religion while monotony has been avoided the essays form distinct unit in most cases selections are longer than usual long enough in fact to introduce student to each ﬁeld result he can be made to feel that every subject is of importance and to realize that every chapter

suggestions are included in the critical notes in general i have assumed that instructors will prefer their own methods and have tried to leave them unhampered the exposition of mechanism the levers of the human body 1 the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https arthur keith in all the foregoing chapters we have been considering only the muscular engines of the human machine counting them over and comparing their construction and their mechanism with those of the ombustion engine of motor cycle but of the levers or through which muscular engines exert their power we have said nothing hitherto nor shall we get any help by now spending time on the levers of motor cycle we have already confessed that they are arranged in way which is quite different from that which we ﬁnd in the human machine in the motor cycle all the levers are of that complex kind which are called wheels and the joints at which these levers work are also circular the joints of motor cycle are the surfaces between the axle and the bushes which have to be kept constantly oiled we freely admit that the systems of levers in the human machine are quite unlike those of motor cycle they are more simple and it is easy to ﬁnd in our bodies examples of all the three orders of levers the joints at which bony levers meet and move on each other are very different from those we ﬁnd in motor cycles indeed i must confess they are not nearly so simple and lastly i must not forget to mention anoth er difference these levers we are going to study are least are so densely inhabited by myriads of minute bone builders that we must speak of them living i want to lay emphasis on that fact because i did not insist enough on the living nature of muscular engines fig chisel 10 inches long used lever of the ﬁrst order we are all well acquainted with levers we apply them every day box arrives with its lid nailed down we take chisel use it lever pry the lid open and see marvel in what we have done fig 1 and yet we thereby did with ease what would have been impossible us even if we had put out the whole of our unaided strength the use of levers is an old discovery more than 1500 years before christ englishmen living on salisbury plain applied the invention when they raised the great stones at stonehenge and at avebury more than 2000 years earlier still egyptians employed it in raising the pyramids even at that time men had made great progress they were already reaping the rewards of discoveries and inventions but none i am sure surprised them more than the discovery of the lever by its use one man could exert the strength of hundred men they soon observed that levers could be used in three different ways the instance already given the prying open of lid by using chisel lever is an example of one way fig 1 it is then used lever of the ﬁrst order now in the ﬁrst order one end of the lever is applied to the point of resistance which in the case just mentioned was the lid of the box at the other end we apply our strength force or power the edge of the box against which the chisel is worked serves fulcrum and lies between the handle where the power is applied and the bevelled edge which moves the resistance or weight pair of ordinary weighing scales also exempliﬁes the ﬁrst order of levers the knife edge on which the beam is balanced serves fulcrum it is placed exactly in the middle of the beam which we shall suppose to be 10 inches long if we place weight in one scale to represent the resistance to be overcome the weight will be lifted the moment that pound of sugar has been placed in the opposite sugar thus represe nting the power if however we move the or fulcrum so that it is only 1 inch from the sugar end of the beam and 9 inches from the weight end then we ﬁnd that we have to pour in 9 lb of sugar to equalise the weight the chisel used in prying open the box lid was 10 inches long it was pushed under the lid distance of 1 inch leaving the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https skull lever of the ﬁrst order use power lever by using lever in this way we increased our strength ninefold the longer we make the power arm the nearer we push the fulcrum towards the weight or resistance end the greater becomes our power this we shall ﬁnd is discovery which nature made use of many millions of years ago in fashioning the body of man and of beast when we apply our force to the long end of lever we increase our power we may also apply it nature has done in our bodies another purpose we have just noted that if the weight end of the beam of pair of scales is nine times the length of the sugar end that weight will count erpoise 9 lb of sugar we also see that the weight scale moves at nine times the speed of the sugar scale now it often happens that nature wants to increase not the power but the speed with which load is lifted in that case the sugar scale is placed at the long end of the beam and the weight scale at the short end it then takes weight to raise single pound of sugar but the sugar scale moves with nine times the speed of the weight scale nature often sacriﬁces power to obtain speed the arm is used lever of this kind when cricket ball is thrown nothing could look less like pair of scales than man head or skull and yet when we watch how it is poised and the manner in which it is moved we ﬁnd that it too acts lever of the ﬁrst order the fulcrum on which it moves is the ﬁrst vertebra of the spine fig 2 when man stands quite erect with the head well thrown back the ear passages are almost directly over the fulcrum it will be convenient to call that part of the head which is behind the ear passages the and the part which is in front the now the face is attached to the part of the lever and represents the weight or load to be moved while the muscles of the neck which represent the power are yoked to the end of the lever the hinder part of the head serves seven pairs of neck muscles but in fig 2 only the chief pair is drawn known the complex muscles when that pair is set in action the end of the head lever is tilted downwards while the end on which the face is set is turned upwards the complex muscles thus tilt the head backwards and the face upwards but where are the muscles which serve the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https or antagonists and reverse the movement in previous chapter it has been shown that every muscle has to work against an opponent or antagonist muscle here we seem to come across defect in the human machine the greater straight muscles in the front of the neck which serve opposing muscles are not only much smaller but at further disadvantage by being yoked to the end of the lever very close to the cup on which the head rocks however if the greater straight muscles lose power by working on very short lever they gain in speed we set them quickly and easily into action when we give nod of recognitio all the strength or power is yoked to the fulcral end of the head the end of its lever is poorly guarded japanese wrestlers know this fact very well and seek to gain victory by pressing up the poorly guarded lever of the head thus producing deadly lock at the fulcral joint indeed it will be found that those who use the method of ﬁghting have discovered great deal about the construction and weaknesses of the levers of the human body merely to poise the head on the atlas may seem to you easy matter balancing the beam of pair of scales on an upright support i am now going to show that great number of difﬁculties had to be overcome before our heads could be safely poised on our necks the head had to be balanced in such way that through the pivot or joint on which it rests safe passageway could be secured one of the most delicate and most important of all the parts or structures of the human machine we have never found good english name this structure so we use its clumsy latin medulla oblongata medulla short in the medulla are placed ofﬁces or centres which regulate the vital operations carried on by the heart and by the lungs it has also to serve passageway thousands of delicate gossamer nerve ﬁbres passing from the brain which ﬁlls the whole chamber of the skull to the spinal cord situated in the canal of the backbone by means of these delicate ﬁbres the brain dispatches messages which control the muscular engines of the limbs and trunk through it too ascend countless ﬁbres along which messages pass from the limbs and trunk to the brain in creating movable joint the head then safe passage had to be obtained the part of the great nerve stem which joins the brain to the spinal cord the medu lla is part of the brain stem this was only one of the difﬁculties which had to be overcome the eyes are set on the lever of the head our safety we must be able to look in all over this shoulder or that we must also be able to turn our heads so that our ears may discover in which direction sound is reaching us in fashioning fulcral joint the head then two different objects had to be secured free mobility the head and safe transit the medullary part of the brain stem how well these objects have been attained is known to all of us we can move our heads in the freest manner and suffer damage whatsoever indeed so strong and perfect is the joint that damage to it is one of the most uncommon accidents of life let us see then how this triumph in engineering has been secured in her inventive moods nature always hits on the simplest plan possible in this case she adopted kind by which older astronomers mounted their telesc opes by such joint the telescope becomes just the head is lever of the ﬁrst order the eyeglass is placed at one end of the lever while the which can be swept across the face of the heavens is place d at the other or more distant end in the human body the ﬁrst vertebra of the trimmed to form socket while an adjacent part of the base of the skull is shaped to play the part of ball the kind of joint to be used having been hit upon the next point was to secure safe passage the brain stem that too was worked out in the simplest fashion the central parts of both ball and socket were cut away or to state the matter more exactly were never formed thus passage was obtained right through the centre of the fulcral joint of the head the centre of the joint was selected because when lever is set in motion the part at the fulcrum moves least and the medulla being placed at that point is least exposed to disturbance when we bend our heads backwards forwards or from side to side when we examine the base of the skull all that we see of the ball of the joint are two knuckles of bone the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https covered by smooth slippery cartilage or gristle to which anatomists give the name of occipital condyles if we were to try to complete the ball of which they form part we should close up the great foramen magnum provides passageway the brain stem on its way to the spinal canal all that is to be seen of the socket or cup is two hollows on the upper surface of the atlas into which the occipital condyles ﬁt fig 3 b merely two parts of the brim of the cup have been preserved to provide socket the condyles or ball fig the opening in the base of the skull by which the brain stem passes to the spinal canal the two occipital condyles r epresent part of the ball which ﬁts into the cup formed by the atlas b the parts of the socket on the ring of the atlas we bend our heads the occipital condyles revolve or glide on the sockets of the atlas but what will happen if we roll our heads backwards to such an extent that the bony edge of the opening in the base of the skull is made to press hard against the brain stem and crush it that of course would mean instant death such an accident has been made impossible 1 by making the opening in the base of the skull so much larger than the brain stem that in extreme movement s there can be action 2 the muscles which move the head on the atlas arrest all movements long before the danger point is reached 3 even if the muscles are caught off their guard they sometimes are certain strong of tough so set automatically to jam the joint before the edge of the foramen can come in contact with the brain stem these are only some of the devices which nature had to contrive in order to secure safe passageway the brain stem but in obtaining safety the brain stem the movements of the head on the atlas had to be limited to mere nodding or bending the movements which are so necessary to us that of turning our heads so that we can sweep our eyes along the whole stretch of the skyline from right to left and from left to right were rendered impossibl this defect was also overcome in simple manner the joints between the ﬁrst and second atlas and were so modiﬁed that turning movement could take place between them instead of between the atlas and skull when we turn or rotate our heads the atlas carrying the skull upon it swings or turns on the axis when we search the manner in which this has been accomplished we see again that natu re has made use of the simplest means at her disposal when we examine vertebra in the course of construction within an unborn animal we see that it is really made up by the union of four parts see fig 4 central block which becomes the body or supporting part right and left arch which enclose passage the spinal cord and lastly fourth part in front of the central block which becomes big and strong only in the ﬁrst atlas when we look at the atlas fig 4 we see that it is merely ring made up of three of the right and left arches and the fourth element the body is missing glance at fig 4 b will show what has become of the body of the atlas it has been joined to the central block of the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https project s upwards within the front part of the ring of the atlas and thus forms pivot round whic h rotatory movements of the head can take place here we have in the atlas an approach to the formation of wheel which has its axle or pivot placed at some distance from its centre and therefore complete revolution of the atlas is impossible battery of small muscles is attached to the lateral levers of the atlas and can swing it freely and the head which it carries certain number of degrees to both right and left the extent of the movements is limited by stout check ligaments thus by the simple expedient of allowing the body of the atlas to be stolen by the axis pivot was obtained round which the head could be turned on horizontal plane fig the original parts of the ﬁrst or atlas vertebra b showing the body of the ﬁrst vertebra ﬁxed to the second thus forming the pivot on which the head turns nature thus set up double joint the movements of the head one between the atlas and axis rotatory movements anoth er between the atlas and skull nodding and movements and all these she increased by giving ﬂexibility to the whole length of the neck makers of modern telescopes have imitated the method nature invented when ﬁxing the human head to the spine their instruments are mounted with double movements in horizontal plane the other movements in vertical plane we thus see that the young engineer well the student of medicine can learn something from the construction of the human body in low forms of vertebrate animals like the ﬁsh and frog the head is joined directly to the body there being neck matter what part of the human body we examine we shall ﬁnd that its mechanical work is performed by means of bony levers having seen how the head is moved lever of the ﬁrst order we are now to choose part which will show us the plan on which levers of the second order work and there are many reasons why we should select the foot it is part which we are all familiar with every day we can see it at rest and in action the foot we have already noted serves lever in walking it is bent or arched lever fig 6 when we stand on one foot the whole weight of our body rests on the summit of the arch we are thus going to deal with lever of complex kind fig chisel used lever of the second order the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https using chisel to pry open the lid of box we may use it lever either of the ﬁrst or of the second order we have already seen fig 1 that in using it lever of the ﬁrst order we pushed the handle downwards while the bevelled end was raised forcing open the lid the edge of the box served rest or fulcrum the chisel if however after inserting the bevelled edge under the lid we raise the handle instead of depressing it we change the chisel into lever of the second order the lid is not now forced up on the bevelled edge but is raised on the side of the chisel some distance from the bevelled edge which thus comes to represent the fulcrum by using chisel in this way we reverse the positions of the weight and fulcrum and turn it into lever of the second order suppose we push the side of the is 10 inches the lid to the extent of 1 inch then the advantag we gain in power is 1 to 10 we thereby increase our strength tenfold if we push the chisel under the lid half its length then our advantage stands 10 to 5 our strength is only doubled if we push it still further of its length then our gain in strength is only 10 to our power is increased by only now this has an important bearing on the problem we are going to investigate the weight of our body falls on the foot so that only about third of the part of it which is formed by the behind the point on which the weight of the body rests the strength of the muscles which act on the heel will be increased only by about we have already seen that double engine made up of the gastr ocnemius and soleus is the power which is applied to the heel when we walk and that the pad of the foot lying across the sole in line with the ball of the great toe serves fulcrum or rest the weight of the body falls on the foot between the fulcrum in front and the power behind in lever of the second order we have explained why the power of the muscles of the calf is increased the more the weight of the body is shifted towards the toes but it is also evident that the speed and the extent to which the body is lifted are diminished if however the weight be shifted more towards the heel the muscles of the calf although losing in power can lift their load more quickly and to greater extent we must look closely at the foot lever if we are to understand it it is arched or bent the front pillar of the arch stretches from the summit or keystone where the weight of the body is poised to the pad of the foot or fulcrum fig 6 the posterior pillar projecting the heel extends from the summit to the point at which the muscular power is applied foot with short anterior pillar and long posterior pillar or heel is one designed power not speed it is one which will serve well or heavy corpulent man the opposite kind one with short heel and long pillar in front is well adapted running and speed now we ﬁnd among the various races of mankind that some have been given long heels such the natives of africa and of australia while other races have been given relatively short stumpy heels of which sort the natives of europe and of china may be cited examples with long heels less powerful muscular engines are required and hence in dark races the calf of the leg is but ill developed because the muscles which move the heel are small we must admit however that the gait of races is usually easy and graceful we europeans on the other hand having short heels need more powerful muscles to move them and hence our calves are usually well developed but our gait is apt to be jerky if we had the power to make our heels longer or shorter at will we should be able is the case in motor cycle to alter our according to the needs of the road with steep hill in front of us we shou ld adopt long slow powerful heel while going down an incline short one would best suit our needs with its motor cycle seems better adapted easy and economical travelling than the human machine if however the human machine has change of gear it has one very marvellous we may call compensatory mechanism want of short easy name the more we walk the more we go the more powerful the muscular engines of the heel become it is quite different with the engine of motor cycle the more it is used the more does it become worn out it is because muscular engine is living that it can respond to work by growing stronger and quicker the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https bones forming the ar ch of the foot seen fr om the inner have wish to extol the human machine unduly nor to run down the motor cycle because of certain defects there is one defect however which is inherent in all motor machines which man has invented but from which the human machine is almost completely free we can illustrate the defect best by comparing the movements of the heel with those of the pin of an engine one serves the lever by which the gastrocnemius helps to propel the body the other serves the same purpose in the propulsion of motor cycle on referring to fig 7 the reader will see that the and the are in straight line in such position the engine is powerless to move the until the ﬂywheel is started thus setting the in motion once started the leverage increases until the stands at right angles to the point of maximum power which is reached when the piston is in the position shown in fig 7 then the leverage decreases until the second dead centre is reached fig 7 c from that point the leverage is increased until the second maximum is reached fig 7 d whereafter it decreases until the arrival at the ﬁrst position completes the cycle thus in each revolution there are two points where all leverage or power is lost points which are surmounted because of the momentum given by the ﬂywheel clearly we should get most out of an engine if it could be kept working near the points of maximum the lever nearly possible at right angles to the fig the of an engine at first dead centr b first maximum leverage c second dead centr d second maximum leverage now we have seen that the tendon of achilles is the piston cord and the heel the of the muscular engine represented by the gastrocnemius and soleus in the standing posture the heel slopes downw ards and backwards and is thus in position regards its piston cord considerably beyond the point of maximum leverage the heel is lifted by the muscles it gradually becomes horizontal and at right angles to its the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https ar ch of the foot fr om the inner side showing some of the muscles which maintain piston cord the heel rises then it becomes more effective lever the muscles gain in power the more the foot is arched the more obliquely is the heel set and the greater is the strength needed to start it moving hence races like the european and mongolian which have short well steeply set heels need large calf muscles it is at the end of the upward stroke that the heel becomes most effective lever and it is just then that we most need power to propel our bodies in forward direction it will be noted that the heel unlike the of an engine never reaches never even approaches that point of powerlessness known to engineers dead centre work is always performed within the limits of the most effective working radius of the lever it is law all the levers of the body they are set and moved in such way to avoid the occurrence of dead centres think what our condition would have been were this not so why we should require revolving set in all our joints another property is essential in lever it must be rigid otherwise it will bend and power will be lost now if the foot were rigid lever there would be missing two of its most useful qualities it could longer act spring or buffer to the body nor could it adapt its sole to the various kinds of surfaces on which we have to tread or stand nature with her usual ingenuity has succeeded in combining those opposing rigidity suppleness and elasticity or springiness resorting to her favorite device the use of muscular engines the arch is necessarily constructed of number of bones which can move on each other to certain extent so that the foot may adapt itself to all kinds of roads and paths it is true that the bones of the arch are loosely bound together by passive ties or ligaments but these can not be lengthened or shortened at will nature had to fall back on the use of muscular engines the maintenance of the foot an arched lever some of these are shown in fig the foot then is lever of very remarkable kind all the time we stand or walk its rigidity its power to serve lever has to be maintained by an elaborate battery of muscular engines all kept constantly at work wonder our feet and legs become tired when we have to stand great deal some of these engines the larger ones are kept in the leg but their tendons or piston cords descend below the to be ﬁxed to various parts of the arch and thus help to keep it up fig 8 within the sole of the foot has been placed an installation of seventeen small engines all of them springing into action when we stand up thus helping to maintain the foot rigid yet ﬂexible lever we have already seen why our muscles are so easily exhausted when we stand still they then get rest at all now it sometimes happens in people who have to stand long periods at stretch that these muscular engines which maintain the arch are overtaxed the arch of the foot gives way the foot becomes ﬂat and ﬂexible and can longer serve lever many men and women thus become permanently crippled they can not step off their toes but must shufﬂe along on the inner sides of their feet but if the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https of the overworked muscles which maintain the arch is hard in people it is even harder in boys and girls who have to stand quite still long time or who have to carry such burdens are beyond their strength when we are young the bony levers and muscular engines of our feet have not only their daily work to but they have continually to effect those wonderful alterations which we call growth hence the muscular engines of young people need special care they must be given plenty of work to but that kind of active action which gives them alternate strokes of work and rest even the engine of motor cycle has three strokes of play one of work our engines too must have liberal supply of the right kind of fuel but even with all those precautions we have to confess that the muscular engines of the foot sometim es break down and the leverage of the foot becomes threatened nor have we succeeded in ﬁnding out why they are so liable to break down in some boys and girls and not in others some day we shall discover this too we are now to look at another part of the human machine so that we may study lever of the third order the lever formed by the forearm and hand will suit our purpose very well it is pivoted or jointed at the elbow the elbow is its fulcrum fig 9 b at the opposite end of the lever in the upturned palm of the hand we shall place weight of 1 lb to represent the load to be moved the power which we are to yoke to the lever is strong muscular engine we have not mentioned before called the brachialis anticus or front brachial muscle it lies in the uppe r arm where it is ﬁxed to the bone of that the humerus it is attached to one of the bones of the beyond the elbow in the second order of lever we have seen that the muscle worked on one end while the weight rested on the lever somewhere between the muscular attachment and the fulcrum in levers of the third order the load is placed at the end of the lever and the muscle is attached somewhere between the load and the fulcrum fig 9 in the examp le we are considering the brachial muscle is attached about half an inch beyond the fulcrum at the elbow while the total length of the lever measured from the elbow to the palm is 12 inches now it is very evident that the muscle or power being attached so close to the elbow works under great disadvantage regards strength it could lift weight placed on the forearm directly over its attachment easily single pound weight placed on the palm but then there is this advantage the weight placed in the hand moves with times the speed of the weight situated near the elbow what is lost in strength is gained in speed whenever nature wishes to move light load quickly she employs levers of the third order fig chisel used lever of the third order w weight p power f fulcrum we have often to move our forearm very quickly sometimes to save our lives the difference of of second may mean life or death to us on the face of cliff when we clutch at branch or jutting rock to save fall the quickness of blow we give or fend depends on the length of our reach long forearm and hand are ill adapted lifting heavy burdens strength is sacriﬁced if they are too long hence we ﬁnd that the laboring peoples of the and usually short forearms and hands while the peoples who live on such bounties nature may provide them have relatively long forearms and the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https earm and hand lever of the third order fig the action of the brachialis anticus in the arm of an anthr opoid man differs from anthropoid apes which are distant cousins of his in having forearm which is considerably shorter than the upper arm whereas in anthropoid apes the forearm is much the longer that fact surprises us at ﬁrst especially when we remember that anthropoids spend most of their lives amongst trees and use their arms much more than their legs in swinging the weight of their heavy bodies from branch to branch and from tree to tree long forearm and hand give them long and quick reach so that they can seize distant branches and swing themselves along safely and at good pace our ﬁrst thought is to suppose that long forearm being weak lever will be ill adapted climbing but when you look at fig 10 the explanation becomes plain when branch is seized by the hand and the whole weight of the body is supported from it the entire machinery of the arm changes its action the forearm is longer the lever which the brachial muscle moves fig 10 but now becomes the base from which it acts the part which was its piston cord now serves its base of ﬁxation and what was its base of ﬁxation to the humerus becomes its piston cord the humerus has become lever of the third order its fulcrum is at the elbow the weight of the body is attached to it at the shoulder and represents the load which has to be lifted we also notice that the brachial muscle is attached long way up the humerus thus increasing its power very greatly although the rate at which it helps in lifting the body is diminished we can see then why the humerus is short and the forearm long in anthropoid apes shortening the humerus makes it more powerful lever lifting the body that is why anthropoids are strong and agile but then watch them use those long hands and forearms the varied and precise movements we have to perform in our daily lives and you will see how clumsy they are in the human machine the levers of the arm have been fashioned not climb ing but work of another kind which brings us livelihood we must have perfect control over our hands the longer the lever of the forearm is made the more difﬁcult does control of the hand become hence in the human machine the forearm is made relatively short and the upper arm long we have just seen that the brachial muscle could at one time move the forea rm and hand but that when they are ﬁxed it could then use the humerus lever and the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https the weight of the body what should we think of metal engine which could reverse its action so that it could act through its at one time and through its cylinder at another yet that is what great numbe r of the muscular engines of the human machine every day there is another little point but an important one which i must mention before this chapter is ﬁnished i have spoken of the forearm and hand if they formed single solid lever of course that is not so there are joints at the wrist where the hand can be moved on the forearm but when weight is placed in the hand these joints became ﬁxed by the action of muscles the ﬁxing muscles are placed in the forearm both in front and behind and are set in action the moment the hand is loaded the wrist joint is ﬁxed just in the same way the joints of the foot are made rigid by muscles when it has to serve lever even when we take pen in our hand and write these engines which balance and ﬁx the wrist have to be in action all the time the steadiness of our writing depends on how delicately they are balanced like the muscles of the foot the ﬁxers of the wrist may become overworked and exhausted occasionally happens in men and women who not hold their pens correctly and write long spells day after day the which happens in them is called writer cramp but it is disaster of the same kind that

position above the upper end of the magazine and having along its lower edge shown in fig 2 horizontal teeth to engage the teeth in the upper end of the matrices and hold them in suspension the teeth of the matrix each letter differ in number or arrangement or both from the teeth of matrices bearing other letters and the teeth on the lower edge of the distributor bar are correspondingly varied in arrangement at different points in the length of the bar see fig 2 the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https matrices are moved forward into engagement with the distributor bar and also into engagement with the threads of horizontal screws u which are extended parallel with the distributor bar and constantly rotated so that they cause the matrices to travel one after another along the distributor and over the mouths of the channels in the magazines each matrix is held in suspension until it arrives over its proper channel where the ﬁrst time its teeth bear such relation to those of the bar that it is released and permitted to fall into the magazine the speed of the machine which is commonly from four to ﬁve thousand ems per hour but which has reached ten thousand and upward in competitive trials is due to the fact that the matrices pursue circulatory course leaving the magazine at the lower end passing thence to the line and to the casting mechanism and ﬁnally returning to the top of the magazine this permits the composition of one line the casting of another and the distribution of third to proceed simultaneously assembling and keyboard mechanisms the matrices pass through the magaz ine by gravity their release is effected by mechanisms shown in figs 5 and 6 which are vertical sections through the magazine the keyboard and

the position previously occupied by the one released fig thus it is that the alternate rising and falling of the two escapement pawls permits the matrices to escape one at time it is evident that the escapements could be operated directly by rods connected with the ﬁnger but this direct conn ection is objectionable because of the labor required on the part of the operator and the danger that the keys may not be fully depressed moreover it is essential that the escapements should act individually with moderate speed to the end that the matrices may be properly engaged and disengaged by the pawls these reasons and to secure easy and uniform action of the parts the mechanism shown in figs 5 and 6 is introduced between the ﬁnger and escapements the vertical rods c which actuate the

does gardener work yet takes its share of the harvest at its own hour when the earth is joyful with the new life of spring let us follow the manoeuvres of this insect which takes its tithe of the green pea i benevolent will allow it to take its dues it is precisely to beneﬁt it that i have sown few rows of the beloved plant in corner of my garden without other invitation on my part than this modest expenditure of it arrives punctually during the month of may it has learned that this stony soil rebellious at the culture of the gardener is bearing peas the ﬁrst time in all haste therefore it has hurried an agent of the entomological revenue system to demand its dues whence does it come it is impossible to say precisely it has come from some shelter somewhere in which it has passed the winter in state of torpor the ee the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https its rind during the heats of the summer furnishes an excellent refuge homeless insects under its partly detached sheets of bark i have often found our weevil in such winter refuge sheltered under the dead covering of the plane or otherwise protected while the winter lasts it awakens from its torpor at the ﬁrst touch of kindly sun the almanac of the instincts has aroused it it knows well the gardener when the are in ﬂower and seeks its favorite plant journeying thither from every side running with quick short steps or nimbly ﬂying small head ﬁne snout costume of ashen grey sprinkled with brown ﬂattened dumpy compact body with two large black dots on the rear such is the summary portrait of my visitor the middle of may approaches and with it the van of the invasion they settle on the ﬂowers which are not unlike butterﬂies i see them at the base of the blossom or inside the cavity of the keel of the ﬂower but the majority explore the petals and take possession of them the time laying the eggs has not yet arrived the morning is mild the sun is warm without being oppressive it is the moment of nuptial ﬂights the time of rejoicing in the splendor of the sunshine everyw here are creatures rejoicing to be alive couples come together part and when towards noon the heat becomes too great the weevils retire into the shadow taking refuge singly in the folds of the ﬂowers whose secret corners they know so well w will be another day of festival and the next day also until the pods emer ging from the shelter of the keel of the ﬂower are plainly visible enlar ging from day to day few gravid females more pressed time than the others conﬁde their eggs to the growing pod ﬂat and meager it issues from its ﬂoral sheath these hastily laid batches of eggs expelled perhaps by the exigencies of an ovary incapable of further delay seem to in serious danger the seed in which the grub must establish itself is yet more than tender speck of green without ﬁrmness and without any farinaceous tissue larva could possibly ﬁnd sufﬁcient nourishment there unless it waited the pea to mature but is the grub capable of fasting any length of time when once hatched it is doubtful the little i have seen tells that the newborn grub must establish itself in the midst of its food quickly possibl and that it perishes unless it can so i am therefore of opinion that such eggs are deposited in immature pods are lost however the race will hardly suffer by such loss so fertile is the little beetle we shall see directly how prodigal the female is of her eggs the majority of which are destined to perish the important part of the maternal task is completed by the end of may when the shells are swollen by the expanding peas which have reached their ﬁnal growth or are but little short of it i was anxious to see the fema le bruchus at work in her quality of curculionid our classiﬁcation declares her 4 the other weevils are rhyncophora beaked insects armed with drill with which to prepar the hole in which the egg is laid the bruchus possesses only short snout or muzzle excellently adapted eating soft tissues but valueless drill the method of installing the family is consequently absolutely different there are industrious preparations with the balinidae the larinidae and the rhynchit ides not being equipped with long oviscapt the mother sows her eggs in the open with protection against the heat of the sun and the variations of temperature nothing could be simpler and nothing more perilous to the eggs in the absence of special characteristics which would enable them to resist the alternate trials of heat and cold moisture and drought in the caressing sunlight of ten in the morning the mother runs up and down the chosen pod ﬁrst on one side then on the other with jerky capricious the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https she repeatedly extrudes short oviduct which oscillates right and left though to graze the skin of the pod an egg follows which is abandoned soon laid hasty touch of the oviduct ﬁrst here then there on the green skin of the and that is all the egg is left there unprotected in the full sunlight choice of position is made such might assist the grub when it seeks to penetrate its larder some eggs are laid on the swellings created by the peas beneath others in the barren valleys which separate them the ﬁrst are close to the peas the second at some distance from them in short the eggs of the bruchus are laid at random though on the wing we observe still more serious vice the number of eggs is out of all proportion to the number of peas in the pod let us note at the outset that each grub requires one pea it is the necessary ration and is largely sufﬁcient one larva but is not enough several nor even two one pea to each grub neither more nor less is the unchangeable rule we should expect to ﬁnd signs of procreative economy which would impel the female to take into account the number of peas contained in the pod which she has just explored we might expect her to set numerical limit on her eggs in conformity with that of the peas available but such limit is observed the rule of one pea to one grub is always contradicted by the multiplicity of consumers my observations are unanimous on this point the number of eggs deposited on one pod always exceeds the number of peas available and often to scandalous degree however meager the contents of the pod there is superabundance of consumers dividing the sum of the eggs upon such or such pod by that of the peas contained therein i ﬁnd there are ﬁve to eight claimants each pea i have found ten and there is reason why this prodigality should not go still further many are called but few are chosen what is to become of all these supernumeraries perforce excluded from the banquet want of space the eggs are of fairly bright amber yellow cylindrical in form smooth and rounded at the ends their length is at most of an inch each is afﬁxed to the pod by means of slight network of threads of coagulated albumen neither wind nor rain can loosen their hold the mother not infrequently emits them two at time one above the other not infrequently also the uppermost of the two eggs hatches before the other while the latter fades and perishes what was lacking to this egg that it should fail to produce grub perhaps bath of sunlight the incubating heat of which the outer egg has robbed it whether on account of the fact that it is shadowed by the other egg or other reasons the elder of the eggs in group of two rarely follows the normal course but perishes on the pod dead without having lived there are exceptions to this premature end sometimes the two eggs develop equally well but such cases are exceptional so that the bruchid family would be reduced to about half its dimensions if the binary system were the rule to the detriment of our peas and to the advantage of the beetle the eggs are commonly laid one by one and in isolation recent emer gence is shown by little sinuous mark pale or whitish where the skin of the pod is raised and withered which starts from the egg and is the work of the newborn larva tunnel along which the grub works its way while seeking point from which it can escape into pea this point once attained the larva which is scarcely of an inch in length and is white with black head perforates the envelope and plunges into the capacious hollow of the pod it has reached the peas and crawls upon the nearest i have observed it with the magniﬁer having explored the green globe its new world it begins to sink well perpendicularly into the sphere i have often seen it halfway in wriggling its tail in the effort to work the quicker in short time the grub disappears and is at home the point of entry minute but always easily recognizable by its brown coloration on the pale the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https of the pea has ﬁxed location it may be at almost any point on the surface of the pea but an exception is usually made of the lower half that is the hemisphere whose pole is formed by the supporting stem it is precisely in this portion that the germ is found which will not be eaten by the larva and will remain capable of developing into plant in spite of the large aperture made by the emer gence of the adult insect why is this particular portion left untouched what are the motives that safeguard the germ it goes without saying that the bruchus is not considering the gardener the pea is meant it and one else in refusing the few bites that would lead to the death of the seed it has intention of limiting its destruction it abstains from other motives let us remark that the peas touch laterally and are pressed one against the other so that the grub when searching point of attack can not circulate at will let us also note that the lower pole expands into the umbilical excrescence which is less easy of perforation than those parts protected by the skin alone it is even possible that the umbilicum whose organization differs from that of the rest of the pea contains peculiar sap that is distasteful to the little grub such doubtless is the reason why the peas exploited by the bruchus are still able to germinate they are damaged but not dead because the invasion was conducted from the free hemisphere portion less vulnerable and more easy of access moreover the pea in its entirety is too large single grub to consume the consumption is limited to the portion preferred by the consumer and this portion is not the essential portion of the pea with other conditions with very much smaller or very much larger seeds we shall observe very different results if too small the germ will perish gnawed like the rest by the insufﬁciently provisioned inmate if too large the abundance of food will permit of several inmates exploited in the absen ce of the pea the cultivated vetch and the broad bean afford us an excellent example the smaller seed of which all but the skin is devoured is left incapable of germination but the large bean even though it may have held number of grubs is still capable of sprouting knowing that the pod always exhibits number of eggs greatly in excess of the enclosed peas and that each pea is the exclusive property of one grub we naturally ask what becomes of the superﬂuous grubs they perish outside when the more precocious have one by one taken their places in their vegetable larder or they succumb to the intolerant teeth of the ﬁrst occupants neither explanation is correct let us relate the facts on all old are at this stage which the adult bruchus has emer ged leaving large round hole of exit the will show variable number of ﬁne reddish punctuations perforated in the centre what are these spots of which i count ﬁve six and even more on single pea it is impossible to be mistaken they are the points of entry of many grubs several grubs have entered the pea but of the whole group only one has survived fattened and attained the adult age and the others we shall see at the end of may and in june the period of let us inspect the still green and tender peas nearly all the peas invaded show us the multiple perforations already observed on the dry peas abandoned by the weevils does this actually mean that there are several grubs in the pea yes skin the peas in question separate the cotyledons and break them up may be necessary we shall discover several grubs extremely youthful curled up fat and lively each in little round niche in the body of the pea peace and welfare seem to reign in the little community there is quarrelling jealousy between neighbors the feast has commenced food is abundant and the feasters are separated one from another by the walls of uneaten substance with this isolation in separate cells conﬂicts need be feared sudden bite of the mandibles the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https or accidental all the occupants enjoy the same rights of property the same appetite and the same strength how does this communal feast terminate having ﬁrst opened them i place number of peas which are found to be well peopled in glass i open others daily in this way i keep myself informed to the progress of the various larvae at ﬁrst nothing noteworthy is to be seen isolated in its narrow chamber each grub nibbles the substance around it peacefully and parsimoniously it is still very small mere speck of food is feast but the contents of one pea will not sufﬁce the whole number to the end famine is ahead and all but one must perish soon indeed the aspect of things is entirely changed one of the which occupies the central position in the to grow more quickly than the others scarcely has it surpassed the others in size when the latter cease to eat and longer attempt to burrow forwards they lie motionless and resigned they die that gentle death which comes to unconscious lives henceforth the entire pea belongs to the sole survivor now what has happened that these lives around the privileged one should be thus annihilated in default of satisfactory reply i will propose suggestion in the centre of the pea less ripened than the rest of the seed by the chemistry of the sun may there not be softer pulp of quality better adapted to the infantile digestion of the grub there perhaps being nourished by tenderer sweeter and perhaps more tasty tissues the stomach becomes more vigorous until it is ﬁt to undertake less easily digested food nursling is fed on milk before proceeding to bread and broth may not the central portion of the pea be the of the bruchid with equal rights ﬁred by an equal ambition all the occupants of the pea bore their way towards the delicious morsel the journey is laborious and the grubs must rest frequently in their provisional niches they rest while resting they frugally gnaw the riper tissues surrounding them they gnaw rather to open way than to ﬁll their stomachs finally one of the excavators favored by the direction taken attains the central portion it establishes itself there and all is over the others have only to die how are they warned that the place is taken they hear their brother gnawing at the walls of his lodging can they feel the vibration set up by his nibbling mandibles something of the kind must happen from that moment they make attempt to burrow further without struggling against the fortunate winner without seeking to dislodge him those which are beaten in the race give themselves up to death i admire this candid resignation on the part of the departed another of also present factor the pea weevil is the largest of our bruchidae when it attains the adult stage it requires certain amplitude of lodging which the other weevils not require in the same degree pea provides it with sufﬁciently spacious cell nevertheless the cohabitation of two in one pea would be impossible there would be room even were the two to put up with certain discomfort hence the necessity of an inevitable decimation which will suppress all the competitors save one now the superior volume of the broad bean which is almost much beloved by the weevil the pea can lodge conside rable community and the solitary can live cenobite without encroaching on the domain of their neighbors ﬁve or six or more can ﬁnd room in the one bean moreover each grub can ﬁnd its infant diet that is that layer which remote from the surface hardens only gradually and remains full of sap until comparatively late period this inner layer represents the crumb of loaf the rest of the bean being the crust in pea sphere of much less capacity it occupies the central portion limited point at which the grub develops and lacking which it perishes but in the bean it lines the wide adjoining faces of the two ﬂattened cotyledons matter where the point of attack is made the grub has only to bore straight down when it quickly reaches the the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https what is the result i have counted the eggs adhering to and the beans included in the pod and comparing the two ﬁgures i ﬁnd that there is plenty of room the whole family at the rate of ﬁve or six dwellers in each bean superﬂuous larvae perish of hunger when barely issued from the egg all have their share of the ample provision all live and prosper the abundance of food balances the prodigal fertility of the mother if the bruchus were always to adopt the broad bean the establishment of her family i could well understand the exuberant allowance of eggs to one pod rich foodstuf f easily obtained evokes large batch of eggs but the case of the pea perplexes by what aberration does the mother abandon her children to starvation on this totally insufﬁcient vegetable why so many grubs to each pea when one pea is sufﬁcient only one grub matters are not so arranged in the general of life certain foresight seems to rule over the ovary so that the number of mouths is in proportion to the abundance or scarcity of the food consumed the scarabaeus the sphex the necrophorus and other insects which prepare and preserve alimentary provision their families are all of narrowly limited fertility because the balls of dung the dead or paralyzed insects or the buried corpses of animals on which their offspring are nourished are provided only at the cost of laborious ef forts the ordinary bluebottle on the contrar y which lays her eggs upon butcher meat or carrion lays them in enormous batches trusting in the inexhaustible riches represented by the corpse she is prodigal of offspring and takes account of numbers in other cases the provision is acquired by audacious brigandage which exposes the newly born offspring to thousand mortal accidents in such cases the mother balances the chances of destruction by an exaggerated ﬂux of eggs such is the case with the meloides which stealing the goods of others under conditions of the greatest peril are accordingly endowed with prodigious fertility the bruchus knows neither the fatigues of the laborious obliged to limit the size of her family nor the misfortunes of the parasite obliged to produce an exaggerated number of offspring without painful search entirely at her ease merely moving in the sunshine over her favorite plant she can insure sufﬁcient provision each of her offspring she can so yet is foolish enough to the pod of the pea nursery insufﬁciently provided in which the great majority will perish of starvat ion this ineptitude is thing i can not understand it clashes too completely with the habitual foresight of the maternal instinct i am inclined to believe that the pea is not the original food plant of the bruchus the original plant must rather have been the bean one seed of which is capable of supporting dozen or more larvae with the larger cotyledon the crying disproportion between the number of eggs and the available provision disappears moreover it is indubitable that the bean is of earlier date than the pea its exceptional size and its agreeable ﬂavor would certainly have attracted the attention of man from the remotest periods the bean is mouthful and would be of the greatest value to the hungry tribe primitive man would at an early date have sown it beside his wattled hut coming from central asia by long stages their wagons drawn by shaggy oxen and rolling on the circular discs cut from the trunks of trees the early immigrants would have brought to our virgin land ﬁrst the bean then the pea and ﬁnally the cereal that best of safeguards against famine they taught us the care of herds and the use of bronze the material of the ﬁrst metal implement thus the dawn of civilization arose over france with the bean did those ancient teachers also involuntarily bring us the insect which day disputes it with us it is doubtful the bruchidae seem to be indigenous at all events i ﬁnd them levying tribute from various indigenous plants wild vegetables which have never tempted the appetite of man they abound in particular upon the great forest vetch lathyrus latifolius with its magniﬁcent heads of ﬂowers and long handsome pods the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https are not large being indeed smaller than the garden pea but eaten to the very skin they invariably are each is sufﬁcient to the needs of its grub we must not fail to note their number i have counted more than twenty in single pod number unknown in the case of the pea even in the most proliﬁc varieties consequently this superb vetch is in general able to nourish without much loss the family conﬁded to its pod where the forest vetch is lacking the bruchus none the less bestows its habitual prodigality of eggs upon another vegetable of similar ﬂavor but incapable of nourishing all the grubs example the travelling vetch vicia peregrina or the cultivated vetch vicia saliva the number of eggs remains high even upon insufﬁcient pods because the original offered copious provision both in the multiplicity and the size of the seeds if the bruchus is really stranger let us regard the bean the original if indigenous the lar ge vetch sometime in the remote past we received the pea growing it at ﬁrst in the prehistoric vegetable garden which already supplied the bean it was found better article of diet than the broad bean which after such good service is comparatively neglected the weevil was of the same opinion man and without entirely forgetting the bean and the vetch it established the greater part of its tribe upon the pea which from century to century was more widely cultivated we have to share our peas the bruchidae take what they need and bestow their leavings on us this prosperity of the insect which is the offspring of the abundance and equality of our garden products is from another point of view equivalent to decadence the weevil ourselves progress in matters of food and drink is not always beneﬁcial the race would proﬁt better if it remained frugal on the bean and the vetch the bruchus founded colonies in which the infant mortality was low there was room all on the delicious though its fruits may be the greater part of its offspring die of starvation the rations are few and the hungry mouths are multitudinous we will linger over this problem longer let us observe the grub which has now become the sole tenant of the pea by the death of its brothers it has had part in their death chance has favored it that is all in the centre of the pea wealthy solitude it performs the duty of grub the sole duty of eating it nibbles the walls enclosing it enlar ging its lodgment which is alway s entirely ﬁlled by its corpulent body it is well shaped fat and shining with health if i disturb it it turns gently in its niche and sways its head this is its manner of complaining of my importunities let us leave it in peace it proﬁts so greatly and so swiftly by its position that by the time the have come it is already preparing its approaching liberation the adult is not sufﬁciently well equipped to open itself way out through the pea which is now completely hardened the larva knows of this future helplessness and with consummate art provides its release with its powerful mandibles it bores channel of exit exactly round with extremely sides the most skilful could better to prepare the door of exit in advance is not enough the grub must also provide the tranquillity essential to the delicate processes of nymphosis an intruder migh t enter by the open door and injure the helpless nymph this passage must therefore remain closed but how the grub bores the passage of exit it consumes the farinaceous matter without leaving crumb having come to the skin of the pea it stops short this membrane is the door to the chamber of metamorphosis its protection against the evil intentions of external creatures it is also the only obstacle which the adult will encounter at the moment of exit to lessen the difﬁculty of opening it the grub takes the precaution of gnawing at the inner side of the skin all round the circumference so to make line of least resistance the perfect insect will only have to heave with its shoulder and strike few blows with the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https in order to raise the circular door and knock it off like the lid of box the passage of exit shows through the diaphanous skin of the pea large circular spot which is darkened by the obscurity of the interior what passes behind it is invisible hidden it is behind sort of window pretty invention this little closed porthole this barricade against the invader this raised by push when the time has come the hermit to enter the world shall we credit it to the bruchus did the ingenious insect conceive the undertaking did it think out plan and work out scheme of its own devising this would be small triumph the brain of weevil before coming to conclusion let us try an experiment i deprive certain occupied peas of their skin and i dry them with abnormal rapidity placing them in glass the grubs prosper well in the intact peas at the proper time the preparations emer gence are made if the grub acts on its own inspiration if it ceases to prolong its boring directly it recognizes that the outer coating auscultated from time to time is sufﬁciently thin what will it under the conditions of the present test feeling itself at the requisite distance from the surface it will stop boring it will respect the outer layer of the bare pea and will thus obtain the indispensable protecting screen nothing of the kind occurs in every case the passage is completely excavated the entrance gapes wide open large and carefully executed though the skin of the pea were in its place reasons of security have failed to modify the usual method of work this open lodging has defence against the enemy but the grub exhibits anxiety on this score neither is it thinking of the outer enemy when it bores down to the skin when the pea is intact and then stops short it suddenly stops because the innutritious skin is not to its taste we ourselves remove the parchm skins from mess of from culinary point of view they are so much waste matter the larva of the bruchus like ourselves dislikes the skin of the pea it stops short at the horny coverin g simply because it is checked by an uneatable substance from this aversion little mirac le arises but the insect has sense of logic it is passively obedient to the superior logic of facts it obeys its instinct unconscious of its act is crystal when it assembles in exquisite order its battalions of atoms sooner or later during the month of august we see shadowy circle form on each inhabited pea but only one on each seed these circles of shadow mark the doors of exit most of them open in september the lid though cut out with punch detaches itself cleanly and falls to the ground leaving the oriﬁce free the bruchus emer ges freshly clad in its ﬁnal form the weather is delightful flowers are abundant awakened by the summer showers and the weevils visit them in the lovely autumn weather then when the cold sets in they take up their winter quarters in any suitable retreat others still numerous are less hasty in quitting the native seed they remain within during the whole winter sheltered behind the which they take care not to touch the door of the cell will not open on its hinges or to be exact will not yield along the line of least resistance until the warm days return then the late arrivals will leave their shelter and rejoin the more impatient and both will be ready work when the are in ﬂower to take general view of the instincts in their inexhaustible variety is the observer the great attraction of the entomological world nowhere we gain clearer sight of the wonderful way in which the processes of life are ordered thus regarded

if escape is possible if not they will perish without in any way attacking the sound peas eggs new generation will ever be seen upon or within the dried peas in the storehouse there the adult weevil can work further mischief the bruchus is not sedentary inhabitant of granaries it requires the open air the sun the liberty of the ﬁelds frugal in everything it absolutely disdains the hard tissues of the vegetable its tiny mouth is content with few honeyed mouthfuls enjoyed upon the ﬂowers the larvae on the other hand require the tender tissues of the green pea growing in the pod these reasons the granary knows ﬁnal multiplication on the part of the despoiler the origin of the evil is in the it is there that we ought to keep watch on the misdeeds of the bruchus were it not the fact that we are nearly always weaponless when it comes to ﬁghting an insect indestructible by reason of its numbers its small size and its cunning the little creature laughs at the anger of man the gardener curses it

an opening in the centre of the circular which the grub of the weevil prepared in view of its future deliverance the slain has prepared the way the slayer after this detail the rest may be divined when the preliminaries to the metamorphosis are completed when the passage of escape is bored and furnished with its lid of superﬁcial membrane the female chalcidian arrives in busy mood she inspects the peas still on the vine and enclosed in their pods she auscultates them with her antennae she discovers hidden under the general envelope the weak points in the epidermic covering of the peas then applying her oviscapt she thrusts it through the side of the pod and perforates the circular however far withdrawn into the centre of the pea the bruchus whether larvae or nymph is reached by the long

hundred years ago when the saving of rags was inculcated domestic virtue and patriotic duty methods have changed but the material remain s the same in complete modern mill making writing and other papers the process begins with unsightly rags the material from which to form the white sheets that are to receive upon their spotless polished surface the thoughts of philosophers and statesmen the tender messages of affection the counsels and admonitions of ministers the decisions of grave and learned judges and all the wisdom of things mysterious divine that illustriously doth on paper shine was duly set forth in rhyme by the boston news letter in 1769 the bell cart will go through boston about the end of next month it announced and appealed to the inhabitants of that modern seat of learning and philosophy to save their rags the occasion and thus encourage the industry the rags not come to the mammoth factories of in bell carts but by the carload in huge bales gathered from all sections of this great republic well from lands beyond the eastern and western oceans the square compact bundles are carried by elevators well up toward the top of the building where they await the knife of the opener when they have been opened the feeder throws the contents by armfuls into the thrasher the novice or layman ignorant of the state in which rags come to the mill will ﬁnd their condition most unpleasant surprise especially disagreeable to his olfactory nerves yet the unsavory revelation comes with more force little farther on in the the thrasher is great cylindrical receptacle revolving rapidly which is supplied with long wooden beaters or arms passing through wooden cylinder and driven by power when the rags have been tossed in there ensues great pounding and thrashing and the dust is carried off in suction while the whipped rags are dischar ged and carried to the sorting and shredding room here the rags are assorted to size condition and the presence of buttons hooks and eyes or other material that must be removed then those that need further attention are passed on 3 4 the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent

upward the shank being ﬁrmly ﬁxed to the table or operating board here buttons hard seams and all similar intruders are disposed of and the larger pieces of rags are cut into numerous small ones on the blades the rags thus prepared are tossed by the women into receptacles in the tables the work in this room is the most disagreeable and unwholesome in the entire process of manufacture and this despite the fact that these rags too have been thrashed and freed from an amount of dust and dirt beyond belief while one is watching the operations carried on here it is impossible to repress the wish that rags might be bought otherwise than by the pound unfortunately ﬁlth dust and dirt weigh and to wash rags only reduces the weight while this is true reﬂection of the condition in the average mill it is pleasant to know however there are others of the higher class that are decided exceptions far dust and dirt are concerned such are the mills making ledger and bond papers well the mill manufacturing the paper that is used the printing of our greenbacks to which further referenc will be made later in these exceptional mills everything is neat and perfectly clean all the stock used being new and fresh from the cotton or linen mills or from factories producing cloth goods like shirt and corset factories and others of the same sort the sorting and shredding room is always large and light with windows on all sides and well ventilated offering decided contrast in many respects to the less cleanly mills ﬁrst referred to where the women must wear bonnets or hoods the protection of the hair in either case the process is certainly an improvement over the old plan of leaving the rags to decay in cellar to expedite the removal of the glutinous matter from them from the sorting and shredding room the rags are conveyed to the cutter where they are cut and chopped by revolving knives leaving them in small pieces and much freer from dust and grit various ingenious devices are employed removing metal and other hard and injurious matter magnetic brushes serving this purpose in some mills when the cutter has ﬁnished its work the still very dirty rags go further cleansing to the devil or whipper hollow cone with spikes projecting within against which work the spikes of drum dashing the rags about at great speed human lives are often freed of their baser elements and restored to purity and beauty through the chastening inﬂuences of tribulation or adversity in like manner the whipper carries the rags forward step in the process of puriﬁca tion that is necessary before they can be brought to their highest usefulness but the cleansing process which is only preparation what is to follow does not end with the whipper which has served merely to loosen not to dislodge great deal of dust and dirt the ﬁnal operation in the preliminary cleaning is performed by the duster proper which is conical revolving sieve the mass of rags is tossed and shaken about the loosened dust is carried away by the suction of the air which draws the dust particles into tubes furnished with suction fans in most modern mills the rags are carried forward from the duster on an endless belt and careful watch is kept upon them they emer ge to detect the presence of unchopped pieces buttons or other foreign substances the journey of the rags over this endless belt or conveyor terminates in receiving in the ﬂoor of which there are several openings and immediately below these the mouths of the digesters which are in room beneath the digesters they are suggestively and appropriately termed are huge revolving boilers usually upright which often have great diameter eight feet with height of feet and digestive capacity of upward of ﬁve tons of rags each the rags that are to be cooked are fed in to the digesters through the openings in the ﬂoor and the great movable manhole plates are then put in place and closed hermetically sealing the openings or mouths through which the boilers have been fed these having ﬁrst been charged with mixed solution of lime and soda and with live hot steam in lieu of gastric juice digesting ﬂuid and force in some mills the boilers are placed in horizontal position while in others they are in the form of large ball or globe in either case being operated in the manner described those of upright form however are most commonly in use the rags are boiled under steam pressure of the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https pounds to the square inch and the cooking is continued from twelve to fourteen hours it is here that the process of cleaning begins in earnest and the mass of rags is tumbled about in its scalding bath of or milk of lime the coloring and glutinous matters well all other impurities are loosened from the ﬁbers which are in the end so cleansed and puriﬁed to come forth unstained and of virgin purity having been sufﬁciently boiled and digested the mushy mate rial still looking dark and forbidding is emptied onto the ﬂoor below or into receptacles placed directly beneath the boilers where the color and dirt are allowed to drain off the mass is then conveyed to the washers great receptacles which are known hollanders from the fact that these rag engines were invented in holland about the year 1750 they are tubs about twenty feet long nine feet wide and three feet high varying somewhat according to the conditions each tub is divided of its length by an upright partition or it is called which makes narrow course around the vat on one side of the partition the tub is raised in close to which revolves an iron roll about three or four feet in diam eter and covered with knives in the bottom of the tub and directly under the revolving roll is another set of knives called which is stationary and against which the roll can be lowered but let us not anticipate when the emptyings from the boiler have been thrown into the washer continuous stream of water is turned in at one end the roll having been adjusted so to open up the rags they are set in motion these then begin lively chase around the edge of the vat through the form ed by the and under the knives where the water is given chance to wash out all impurities then on up the incline over the from the elevation in the tub cylinder of loth partly immersed in the moving mass holds back the now rapidly whitening ﬁbers while the dirty water escapes into buckets inside the drum and is dischar ged into and through an the heavy particles of dirt settle into what is termed at the bottom of the tub the water clears the roll is lowered closer and closer to the bottom of the in order to open up the ﬁbers more thoroughly the free circulation of the water among them when the several agencies of the washer have accomplished their purpose and the water runs clear and unsullied bleaching material is put into the mass which in the course of from two to six hours becomes white milk the dirty offscourings of all ragdom ﬁrst seen in the original bales and gathered from the four corners of the globe have endured many buffetings many bruisings and tribulations and having been washed come forth pure sweet and clean from the washers the rags are precipitated through trap into drainers which are chambers made of stone and brick with false bottom through which the water is allowed to drain this rag pulp now called half stock is kept in this receptacle until the water and liquor are thoroughly drained off when it becomes white and compact mass of ﬁbers the rags should stand in the drainers at least one week though better results are obtained if they are left period two or three times long the ﬁbers become more subdued the process of paper it has already been described applies more particularly to papers made from rags very large proportion of the cheaper papers are made from wood either entirely or in part and these papers are subjected to dif ferent treatment to which further reference will be made from the drainer the mass is carted to the beating engine or beater which is very similar in construction to the washer just described the knives on the roll in the beater are grouped three together instead of two and are placed nearer the bottom or in order to separate more thoroughly the ﬁbers in the beater are performed many and varying manipulations designed not only to secure more perfect product but also to produce different varieties of paper it is the theory of the beating process that the ﬁbers are not cut but are drawn out to their utmost extent in watching the operations of the beater one notices on the surface of the slowly revolving mass of ﬁbers ﬂoating bluing such the thrifty housewife uses to whiten ﬁne fabrics this familiar agency the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https laundry is introduced into the solution of ﬁbers with the same end in view that is sought in the give the clear white color that is so desirable many of the inventions and discoveries by which the world has proﬁted largely have been due primarily to some fortunate accident and according to pretty story upon which paper makers have set the seal of their belief more than one hundred and ﬁfty years the use of bluing was brought about in the same way about the year 1746 so runs the story buttonshaw the wife of an english paper accidentally dropped into tub of pulp the bag of bluing or its contents which she was about to use in washing of ﬁne linen frightened at what she had done and considering it the part of wisdom to keep silence she discreetly held her peace and awaited results but when her husband had expressed great wonder and admiration over the paper made from that particular pulp and had sold it in london at an advance of several shillings over the price of his other paper which had not met with any such accident she realized that the time silence had passed her account of the happy accident led her grateful husband to purchase costly scarlet cloak her on his next visit to london town this accident brought about another result which was to prove of inestimable value to the future paper use of bluing in paper when especial whiteness is desired important the bluing or coloring is however it is only one of the numerous operations or manipulations that take place in the beater many of these such sizing and require skill and constant watchfulness here too if anywhere adulteration takes place it is sometime s necessary to secure paper at small cost and it is proﬁtable to add to its weight in such cases process of loading takes place here and clay or cheap heavy ﬁbers are added clay is of value not only to increase the weight but also to render the paper more opaque so to prevent type or illustrations from showing through while at the same time it makes possible smoother surface by ﬁlling the pores in the paper but while it adds to the weight clay must of necessity weaken the paper in engine which is done in the beater the size is thoroughly incorporated with the ﬁbers these revolve or ﬂow around the engine this sizing renders the paper more nearly impervious to moisture the difference between paper that is sized and that has repellent surface which prevents the ink from settling into it when it is written upon and an ordinary with its absorbent surface is due entirely to the fact that the former is most carefully treated with sizing both in the beating engine and in the size tub or vat referred to later whereas in the latter paper it is omitted if the paper is to be tinted or colors made from aniline are generally used only in the highest grade of and in some few papers that demand colors fast to the light is any other order of coloring matter employed may be easily imagined considerable skill is required to secure exactly the desired tint and to get the coloring matter so evenly mixed that each small ﬁber shall receive its proper tint and thus to insure that the paper when ﬁnished shall be of uniform color and not present mottled appearance when the operations of the beating engine have been completed most interesting process begins which marks vast advance over the earlier method of forming the sheets of paper with mould and deckel straining off the water and shaking the frame with quick motion to mat the ﬁbers together the patient striving toward something better which has marked all the centuries since man ﬁrst learned to carve his rude records ﬁnds its consummation in the process of making paper in continuous web this result is accomplished by machine ﬁrst inven ted by louis robert workman in mill at enonnes france who obtained frenc h patent with bounty of eight thousand francs its development this he later sold to didot the proprietor of the mill who crossed the channel into england where with the aid of skilled mechanic the machine was in measure perfected and then sold to henry and sealy fourdrinier they with the further aid of bryan donkin their employee and expert engineer made many additional improvements and sank in the enterprise some sixty thousand pounds sterling which their only reward was blighted hopes and embittered lives in 1847 the london times made fruitless appeal on behalf of the surviving brother who was eighty years of age and in great poverty it is seldom that the world voluntarily makes return to those the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https bestowed upon it great material or moral beneﬁts though it is ever ready to expend its treasure engines of destruction and to magnify and reward those who have been most successful in destroying human life the ﬁrst machine mill was started at frogmore hertz england in 1803 which was the year of the great louisiana purchase by the united states and it is not difﬁcult to say which event has been productive of the greater and more beneﬁcial results to this nation through this invention

sword states can be saved without the pen if the power of the pen over the sword is greater than it has ever been before its increased and increasing inﬂuence must be credited in large measure to the inventive genius and the enterprise that has made possible the great output of our modern paper so thoroughly did these forces their work in the beginning that in the century that has elapsed since the fourdrinier brothers sacriﬁced themselves and their means in the perfecting of their machine there have been really changes in the fundamental principle those that have been made have been in the nature of further development and improvement such increasing the speed and widening the web thereby multiplying the product many fold but let us resume the interesting journey of the rags which had reached state of puriﬁcation and perfection pulp and which we left in the beaters in some grades of paper the perfected and prepared pulp is taken from the beaters and passed through what is known reﬁning or jordan engine the purpose of more thoroughly separating the ﬁbers and reducing them to extreme ﬁneness the reﬁning engines are however used only in the manufacture of certain grades of paper the pulp is next taken from the beater or reﬁning engine the case may be to what is called stuf an inclosed vat partly ﬁlled with water in which contrivance shaking and shifting properly called an agitator keeps the ﬁbers in suspension from the the mixture is pumped into what is known the mixing or regulating box here the stream ﬁrst passes over the in continuous ﬂow these are composed of little troughs with and are covered at the bottom with felt to catch any sand or dirt that may still adhere after the numerous operations to which the pulp has been subjected the ﬂow is then forced through the screen which is horizontal piece of metal pierced with slots very ﬁne paper these slots are so small to be only one of an inch in width they are usually about quarter of an inch apart throu gh these tiny apertures the ﬁbers must ﬁnd their way leaving behind in their difﬁcult passage all lumps dirt or knotted ﬁbers which would mar the perfection of the product toward which they are tending vibrating motion is given to the screen the ﬂow passes over it or revolving strainers may be used when the screen has ﬁnished its work the water carrying the pulp in solution ﬂows in an even stream the volume of which varies according to the width of the web of paper to be produced through dischar onto the fourdrinier or cylinder machine the case may be each of which will be duly described this stream has ﬁlmy appearance and is of diverse color depending upon the shade of paper to be produced from its consistency which is about that of milk it is difﬁcult to imagine that it ﬂoats separate particles of ﬁber in such quantities when gathered on the wire cloth and passed to felt blanket and then pressed between rollers to form in second of time broad web of embryo paper sufﬁciently strong and ﬁrm to take deﬁnite form man mastery of the process by which this startling and wonderful change is effected has come one of the rewards of his long and patient study the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https fourdrinier machine which preserves at least the name of the enterprising developers of the invention takes up the work that was formerly done by the molder the wire cloth upon which the ﬁbers are dischar ged is an endless belt the full width of the paper machine upon this the ﬁbers spread out evenly being aided by rubber or oil cloth which delivers the smooth stream under gate regulated to insure perfect evenness and to ﬁx uniformly the ﬁbers of the web now commencing its ﬁnal formation of are fastened on both sides of the wire screen and move with it thus holding the wate ry pulp in place the are adjustable and ﬁx or regulate the width of the paper these and the gate or slicer are attached to what is termed the which corresponds to the deckel used by paper in the days when the manufacture was carried on by hand the stream ﬂows onto the endless belt of wire cloth the water which has borne the ﬁbers ﬁlters into the trough beneath being charged with very ﬁne ﬁbers size coloring matter and other similar ingredients it is carried back into the to save these materials well to contribute again to the extra supply of water needed this reason the trough into which it falls from the revolving wire is called the shaking motion is imparted to the wire from the frame upon which rest the rolls that keep it in its never ending round this aids in draining away the water and mats or interlaces the ﬁbers together at the end of the where the ﬁbers are to leave the wire the next stage of their journey are placed provided with an to take up the surplus water that has not yet found its way through the meshes between these boxes above the wire is roll which impresses the newly formed sheet this impression cylinder is called dandy roll and it is from this that the web receives the markings or impressions that characterize different papers all watermarks patterns and designs which it is desired to have appear in the paper are put upon this roll and here impressed upon the soft sheet which is clariﬁed and left transparent at the point of contact thus the impression is permanently ﬁxed in the ﬁber so that it can be seen at any time by holding the sheet to the light the power of suggestiveness is quality which is highly esteemed wherever it is found and which frequently furnishes standard of judgment judged by such criterion the impression cylinder or dandy roll has an added value in all probability its operation suggested the idea of printing from cylinders in our present web or perfecting presses the matted pulp now having sufﬁcient body passes on between two rolls covered with felt which deliver the web of damp paper upon an endless belt of moist felt while the wire passes

temperature being regulated according to requirements these driers made from iron or steel are usually from three to four feet in diameter and vary in length according to the width of the machine there are from twelve to ﬁfty of these cylinders their number depending upon the character and weight of the paper to be produ ced very heavy sheets requiring many more drying cylinders than sheets of lighter weight strange almost phenomenal conditions come about in the transformation from ﬁlmy pulp to ﬁnished paper sheet which though formed is at the ﬁrst too fragile to carry its own weight

homer heath nugent https great aggregate strength sheet of paper yields readily to tearing but the same sheet when perfectly even tension is applied will demonstrate that it is possessed of wonderful resisting power in evidence may be cited an instance that seems almost beyond belief through some curious mishap web of heavy paper in fact bristol board which had been thoroughly formed was suddenly superheated and then cooled while still on the driers this was caused by difference in temperature of the driers and resulted in the sudden contraction of the web of bristol the strain on the machine was so great that not only were the broken on two of the driers around which the paper was at the moment passing but the driers themselves were actually lifted out of place showing resisting power in the paper of at least several tons the paper now passes to the upright stack of rolls which are known calenders the word is derived from calendra corruption of cylindrus roller or cylinder they are simply rollers revolving in contact and heated from the interior by steam these calenders are used giving to the paper smooth and even surface and are also employed in the smoothing and ﬁnishing of cloth the speed with which the paper passes through these cylinders is remarkable from one hundred to ﬁve hundred feet running through and over the machine in minute and in some of the most recent mills the web is wide one hundred and inches thirteen feet this is very nearly double the average machine width of very few years ago while the speed has increased in proportionate ratio only few years ago the maximum speed was from two hundred and ﬁfty to three hundred feet per minute at this writing 1900 there are machines in operation which run high ﬁve hundred feet per minute but great has been the increase in the production of paper the demand has kept pace steadily the wonderful produ ct of the holds an invincible position in the world economy book and print papers well other cheaper grades the process ends with the calenders after which the paper is slit into required widths by knives which are revolving and so cut continuously paper intended web newspaper presses is taken off in continuous rolls of the widths required varying from seventeen to inches according to the size of the paper to be printed these reels contain from ﬁfteen to thousand lineal feet of paper or from three to ﬁve miles the amount of paper used in disseminating the news of the day is enormous some times one or two mills are required to manufacture the supply single metropolitan daily while one new york newspaper claims to have used four hundred and ﬁfty tons of paper in one christmas edition which is about four times the amount of its regular daily consumption after having been slit into the proper widths by the revolving knives ordinary ﬂat and book papers are cut into sheets by straight knife revolving at proper intervals on horizontal drum the paper in sheets is carried by travelling apron to receiv ing table at the end of the machine where the sheets they fall are carefully examined by experts usually women who remove any that may be imperfect the entire length of paper machine from the screens to the calenders is about one hundred and feet while the height varies the average being about ten feet the machines while necessarily of the ﬁnest adjustment are ponderous and heavy weighing in some cases much four hundred tons this being the weight of the machine itself exclusive of its found ations the is of neces sity well lighted and thoroughly ventilated and should be kept clean throughout cleanliness is an essential factor in the making of good paper while the same general process applies to all classes of paper made the particular character of any paper that is to be produced determines exactly the details of the process through which it shall pass and regulates the deviations to be made from the general operations in order to secure special results example some papers are wanted with rough or antique ﬁnish it is called in such cases calendering is omitted another special process is that by which the paper is made with ragged or this result is obtained in some mills by playing stream of water upon the edge of the pulp crushing and thinning it and thus giving it jagged appearance at the present time this paper is being quite extensively used in bookwork

ordinary papers that are to be printed upon in the usual way and the cheapest grades of r where the requirements are not very exacting and where curtailment of expense is necessary the higher grades of however distinctly separate and additional process is required these papers while on the machine in web form are passed through vat which is called the and which is ﬁlled with liquid sizing made of gelatine from clippings of the horns hides and hoofs of cattle this gelatine or glue being mixed with dissolved alum and made ﬂuid in the vat papers which are treated in this way are known animal or we have duly described papers but these higher grades of papers are dried by what is known the loft or process such paper is permitted to dry very slowly in loft specially constructed the purpose where it is hung on poles several days during which time the loft is kept at temperature of about fahrenheit another detail of considerable importance is that of the ﬁnish or surface of the paper when paper with particularly high or glossy surface is desired it is subjected to separate process after leaving the paper machine known supercalendering supercalendering is effected by passing the web through stack of rolls which are similar to the machine calenders alread y described these rolls are composed of metal cylinders alternating with rolls made of solidiﬁed paper or cotton turned exactly true the top and bottom rolls being of metal and heavier than the others stack of supercalenders is necessarily composed of an odd number of rolls seven nine or eleven the paper passes and repasses through these calenders until the requisi degree of smoothness and polish has been acquired the friction in this machine produces so much electricity that ground wires are often used to carry it off in order that the paper may not become so highly charged to attract dust or cause the sheets to cling together when the ﬁne polish has been imparted the rolls of paper go to the cutting machines which are automatic in action cutting regular sheets of the required length the paper is fed to them in continuous web in the manufacture of some high grades of paper such linens and bonds where an especially ﬁne smooth surface is required the sheets after being cut are arranged in piles of from twelve to ﬁfteen sheets plates of zinc are inserted alternately between them and they are subjected to powerful hydraulic pressure this process is termed plating and is of course very much more expensive than the process of supercalendering described above from the cutters the sheets are carried to the inspectors who are seated in row along an extended board table before two divisions with partitions ten or twelve inches high affording spaces the sheets before and after sorting the work of inspection is performed by women who detect almo st instantly any blemish or imperfecti on in the ﬁnished product it passes through their hands if the paper is to be ruled writing purposes it is then taken to the ruling machines where it is passed under revolv ing discs or pens set at regular intervals these convey the ruling ink to the paper it passes on through the machine and thus form true and continuous lines if the paper is to be folded after ruling in the case of ﬁne the sheets pass on from the ruling machine to the folding machines which are entirely automatic in their action the paper is stacked at the back of the ﬁrst folding guide and is fed in by the action of small rubber rollers which loosen each sheet from the one beneath and push it forward until it is caught by the folding apparatus man mechanical ingenuity has given to the machin es of his invention something that seems almost like human intelligence and in the case of the folding machine the action is so regular and perfect that there seems to be need of an attendant save to furnish constant supply of sheets the folding completed cutting machines are again brought into requisition to cut and trim the sheets to the size of folded note or letter which is the ﬁnal operation before they are sent out into the world on their mission of usefulness the ﬁnished paper may or may not have passed through the ruling and folding process but in either case it goes from the cutters to the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https and packers and then to the all of whom perform the duties indicated by their names the wonderfu l transformation wrought by the magic wand of science and human invention is complete and what came into the factory great bales of offensive rags disgusting to sight and smell goes forth delicate beautiful perfected paper redeemed from ﬁlth and gloriﬁe d into high and noble use purity and beauty have come from what was foul and unwholesome the highly useful has been summoned forth from the seemingly useless product that is one of the essential facto rs in the world progress and that promises to serve an purpose has been developed from material that apparently held not the slightest promise well might the boston news letter of 1769 exclaim in quaint old rhyme rags are beauties which concealèd lie but when in paper charming to the eye pray save your rags new beauties to discover of paper truly every one lover by the pen and press such knowledge is displayed would not exist if paper was not made and well may man pride himself on this achievement this marvelous transformation which represents the fruitage of centuries of striving and endeavor up to this point the reference has been almost entirely to paper made from rags but radical improvements have been made caused by the introduction of wood pulp and these are of such importance that the account would not be complete without some mention of them these changes are mainly in the methods of manipulating the wood to obtain the pulp when that is ready the process from and including the was hers and beaters is very similar to that already described all papers whether made from rags or wood depend upon vegetable ﬁber their substance and fundamental base and it is found that the different ﬁbers used in paper when ﬁnally subdued not differ in fact whether obtained from rags or from the tree growing in the forest in the latter case the raw wood is subjected to chemical treatment which destroys all resinous and foreign matters leaving merely the cellular tissue which it is found does not differ in substance from the cell tissue obtained after treating rags in either case this cellular tissue through the treatment to which the raw material is subjected becomes perfectly plastic or moldable and while the paper made from one differs slightly in certain characteristics from the paper made from the other they are nevertheless very similar and it might be safe to predict that further perfecting of processes will eventually make them practically alike the woods used this purpose are principally poplar and spruce and there are three classes of the wood pulp 1 mechanical wood 2 soda process wood and 3 sulphite wood pulp the ﬁrst method was invented in germany in the logs are hewn in the forest roughly barked and shipped to the factory where the ﬁrst operation is to cut them up by steam saws into blocks about two feet in length any bark that may still cling to the log is removed by rapidly revolving corrugated wheel of steel while the larger blocks are split by steam splitter the next stage of their journey takes these blocks to great millstone set perpendicularly instead of horizontally here very strong and ingenious machine receives one block at time and with an automatically elastic pressure holds it sidewise against the millstone which like the mills of the gods grinds exceeding ﬁne and with the aid of constantly ﬂowing water rapidly reduces these blocks to pulpy form this pulp is carried into tanks from which it is passed between rollers which leave it in thick damp sheets which are folded up evenly shipment or storage future use if paper is operated in connection with the the wood pulp is not necessarily rolled out in sheets but is pumped directly from the tanks to the beaters in the preparation of pulp by the other processes the blocks are ﬁrst thrown into chipping machine with great wheels the short slanting knives of which quick ly cut the blocks into small the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https the soda process invented by meliner in france in 1865 the chips from spruce and poplar logs are boiled under pressure in strong solution of caustic soda when sulphite wood pulp is to be prepared the chips are conveyed from the chipper into hoppers in the upper part of the building here they are thrown into great upright iron boilers or digesters charged with and fed with the fumes of sulphur which is burned the purpose in furnace adjoining the building and which thus forms acid sulphide of lime the sulphite process was originally invented by celebrated philadelphia chemist but was perfected in europe the cooking or boiling to which the wood is subjected in both the soda and sulphite processes effects complete separation of all resinous and foreign substances from the ﬁne and true cell tissue or cellulose which is left pure ﬁber ready use described in the case of all ﬁbers whether rag or wood painstaking work counts and the excellence of the paper is largely dependent upon the time and care given to the reduction of the pulp from the original raw material chemical wood pulp of the best quality makes an excellent product and is largely used both print and book paper it is frequently mixed with rag pulp making paper that can scarcely be distinguished from that made entirely from ﬁne rags though it is not of the proper ﬁrmness the best ﬂat or writing papers all ordinary newspapers well some of the cheaper grades of book and wrapping paper are made entirely from wood the sulphite or soda process supplying the ﬁber and ground wood being used ﬁller in the average newspaper of issue per cent of sulphite ﬁber is sufﬁcient to carry per cent of the ground wood ﬁller the value of the idea is an economical one entirely the ground wood employed costs less than any other of the component parts of sheet the cylinder machine to which reference was made earlier in the chapter was patented in 1809 by prominent paper of england john dickinson in this machine cylinder covered with wire cloth revolves with its lower portion dipping into vat of pulp while by suction partial vacuum is maintained in the cylinder causing the pulp to cling to the wire until it is conveyed to covered cylinder which takes it up and carries it forward in manner similar to the syste m already described this machine is employed in making and other heavy and cheap grades of paper generous mother nature who supplies man wants in such bountiful fashion has furnished on her plains and in her forests an abundance of material that may be transformed into this ﬁne product of human ingenuity esparto spanish grass grown in south africa has entered largely into the making of in england mixed with rags it makes an excellent product but the chemicals required to free it from resin and gritty silica are expensive while the cost of importation has rendered its use in america impractical flax hemp manila jute and straw and of course old paper that has been once used are extensively employed in this manufacture the process beginning with the chemical treatment and boiling that are found necessary in the manipulation of rags the successful use of these materials has met demands that would not otherwise have been supplied result the price has been so cheapened that the demand paper has greatly increased and its use has been extended to many and various purposes many additional items of interest might be described in connection with the methods of manufacturing paper but this work is intended the general reader rather than the manufacturer those wishing further information are referred to technical works on the subject the best linen rags are used the highest grades of writing and bond papers while ordinary note letter and ﬂat papers are made from cotton rags in some mills such the government mill at dalton massachusetts where the government paper is made banknotes and in others where the ﬁnest ledger papers are manufactured none but new clean rags are used these come from the remnants left in the making of linen goods in the government mill where is made the paper our national currency or greenbacks the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https is special attachment on the machine introducing into the paper the silk threads that are always to be seen in our paper money this attachment is just above the wire on the machine and consists of little conducting trough through which ﬂows from receptacle near the machine stream of water holding the silk threads in solution the trough extends across the machin and is provided at intervals with openings through which the short pieces of silk thread are automatically released and sprinkled continuously onto the web of pulp it passes beneath the paper is thus distinguished and infringement and possible counterfeiting are made extremely difﬁcult by the fact that the government absolutely forbids the making of paper by others under similar process well the production of any paper containing these silk threads the laws of the united states pertaining to anything that borders on infringement of our various money issues both metal and currency are most rigid anything approaching similarity of impression is prohibited and cut stamp or impression of any character that approaches in its appearance any money issue of our government is considered violation of the law against counterfeiting and is dealt with severely the government takes the same uncompromising position in regard to the fabrics used in printing its paper issues and it will be quickly seen that the silk thread process described above it is so great variation from anything required in the mercantile world that it would be difﬁcult to produce paper at all similar without an ulterior purpose being at once apparent this reason the silk thread interspersion is in reality very effective medium in preventing counterfeiting not only on account of its peculiar appearance but also because of the elaborate methods necessary in its production in those mills making the ﬁnest grades of paper much of the process of thrashing beating

exposition edited by homer heath nugent https gospel of relaxa tion 6 william james i wish in the following hour to take certain psychological doctrines and show their practical applications to mental hygiene the hygiene of our american life more particularly our people especially in academic circles are turning towards psychology nowadays with great expectations and if psychology is to justify them it must be by showing fruits in the pedagogic and therapeutic lines the reader may possibly have heard of peculiar theory of the emotions commonly referred to in psychological literature the theory according to this theory our emotions are mainly due to those organic stirrings that are aroused in us in reﬂex way by the stimulus of the exciting object or situation an emotion of fear example or surprise is not direct effect of the object presence on the mind but an effect of that still earlier effect the bodily commotion which the object suddenly excites so that were this bodily commotion suppressed we should not so much feel fear call the situation fearful we should not feel surprise but coldly recognize that the object was indeed astonishing one enthusiast has even gone so far to say that when we feel sorry it is because we weep when we feel afraid it is because we run away and not conversely some of you may perhaps be acquainted with the paradoxical formula now whatever exaggeration may possibly lurk in this account of our emotions and i doubt myself whether the exaggeration be very great it is certain that the main core of it is true and that the mere giving way to tears example or to the outward expression of an anger ﬁt will result the moment in making the inner grief or anger more acutely felt there is accordingly better known or more generally useful precept in the moral training of youth or in one personal than that which bids us pay primary attention to what we and express and not to care too much what we feel if we only check cowardly impulse in time example or if we only strike the blow or rip out with the complaining or insulting word that we shall regret long we live our feelings themselves will presently be the calmer and better with particular guidance from us on their own account action seems to follow feeling but really action and feeling go together and by regulating the action which is under the more direct control of the will we can indirectly regulate the feeling which is not thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness if our spontaneous cheerful ness be lost is to sit up cheerfully to look round cheerfully and to act and speak if cheerfulness were already there if such conduct does not make you soon feel cheerful nothing else on that occasion can so to feel brave act if we were brave use all our will to that end and will very likely replace the ﬁt of fear again in order to feel kindly toward person to whom we have been inimical the only way is more or less deliberately to smile to make sympathetic inquiries and to force ourselves to say genial things one hearty laugh together will bring enemies into closer communion of heart than hours spent on both sides in inward wrestling with the mental demon of uncharitable feeling to wrestle with bad feeling only pins our attention on it and keeps it still fastened in the mind whereas if we act if from some better feeling the old bad feeling soon folds its tent like an arab and silently steals away the best manuals of religious devotion accordingly reiterate the maxim that we must let our feelings go and pay regard to them

social reform i can not but think that the tennis and tramping and skating habits and the which are so rapidly extending among our dear sisters and daughters in this country are going also to lead to sounder and heartier moral tone which will send its tonic breath through all our american life i hope that here in america more and more the ideal of the and vigorous body will be maintained neck by neck with that of the and vigorous mind the two coequal halves of the higher education men and women alike the strength of the british empire lies in the strength of character of the individual englishman taken all alone by himself and that strength i am persuaded is perennially nourished and kept up by nothing so much by the national worship in which all classes meet of athletic outdoor

remember well an awful prophecy that it contained about the future of our muscular system human perfection the writer said means ability to cope with the environment but the environment will more and more require mental power from us and less and less will ask bare brute strength wars will cease machines will all our heavy work man will become more and more mere director of nature energies and less and less an exerter of energy on his own account so that if the homo sapiens of the future can only digest his food and think what need will he have of muscles at all and why pursued this writer

your insight and sympathy in cause which i believe is one of paramount patriotic importance to us yankees many years ago scottish medical man clouston they call him there or what we should call an asylum physician the most eminent one in scotland visited this country and said something that has remained in my memory ever since you americans he said wear too much expression on your faces you are living like an army with all its reserves engaged in action the duller countenan ces of the british population betoken better scheme of life they suggest stores of reserved nervous force to fall back upon if any occasion should arise that requires it this inexcitability this presence at all times of power not used i regard continued clouston the great safeguard of our british people the other thing in you gives sense of insecurity and you ought somehow to tone yourselves down you really carry too much expression you take too intensely the trivial moments of life now clouston is trained reader of the secrets of the soul expressed upon the countenance and the observation of his which i quote seems to to mean great deal and all americans who stay in europe long enough to get accustomed to the spirit that reigns and expresses itself there so unexcitable compared with ours make similar observation when they return to their native shores they ﬁnd look upon their compatriots faces either of too desperate eagerness and anxiety or of too intense responsiveness and it is hard to say whether the men or the women show it most it is true that we not all feel about it clouston felt many of us far from deploring it admire it we say what intelligence it shows how different from the stolid cheeks the codﬁsh eyes the slow inanimate demeanor we have been seeing in the british isles intensity rapidity vivacity of appearance are indeed with us something of nationally accepted ideal and the medical notion of irritable weakness is not the ﬁrst thing suggested by them to our mind it was to clouston in weekly paper not very long ago i remember reading story in which after describing the beauty and interest of the heroine personality the author summed up her charms by saying that to all who looked upon her an impression of bottled lightning was irresistibly conveyed bottled lightning in truth is one of our american ideals even of young girl character now it is most ungracious and it may seem to some persons unpa triotic to criticise in public the physical peculiarities of one own people of one own family so to speak besides it may be said and said with justice that there are plenty of lightning temperaments in other countries and plenty of phlegmatic temperaments here and that when all is said and done the more or less of tension about which i am making such fuss is small item in the sum total of nation life and not worth solemn treatment at time when agreeable rather than disagreeable things should be the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https well in one sense the more or less of tension in our faces and in our unused muscles is small thing not much mechanical work is done by these contractions but it is not always the material size of thing that measures its importance often it is its place and function one of the most philosophical remarks i ever heard made was by an unlettered workman who was doing some repairs at my house many years ago there is very little difference between one man and another he said when you go to the bottom of it but what little there is is very important and the remark certainly applies to this case the general may be small when estimated in but its importance is immense on account of its effects on the person spiritual life this follows necessary consequence from the theory of our emotions to which i made reference at the beginning of this article by the sensations that so incessantly pour in from the excited body the and excited habit of mind is kept up and the sultry threatening exhaus ting thunderous inner atmosphere never quite clears away if you never wholly give yourself up to the chair you sit in but always keep your and half contrac ted rise if you breathe eighteen or nineteen instead of sixteen times minute and never quite breathe out at that mental mood can you be in but one of inner panting and expectancy and how can the future and its worries possibly forsake your mind on the other hand how can they gain admission to your mind if your brow be unrufﬂed your respiration calm and complete and your muscles all relaxed now what is the cause of this absence of repose this quality in us americans the explanation of it that is usually given is that it comes from the extreme dryness of our climate and the acrobatic performances of our thermometer coupled with the extraordinary progressiveness of our life the hard work the railroad speed the rapid success and all the other things we know so well by heart well our climate is certainly exciting but hardly more so than that of many parts of europe where nevertheless girls are found and the work done and the pace of life are extreme in every great capital of europe they are here to both of these pretended causes are utterly insufﬁcient to explain the facts to explain them we must go not to physical geography but to psychology and sociology the latest chapter both in sociology and in psychology to be developed in manner that approaches adequacy is the chapter on the imitative impulse first bagehot then tarde then royce and baldwin here have shown that invention and imitation taken together form one may say the entire warp and woof of human life in so far it is social the american and jerkiness and breathlessness and intensity and agony of expression are primarily social and only secondarily physiological phenomena they are bad habits nothing more or less bred of custom and example born of the imitation of bad models and the cultivation of false personal ideals how are idioms acquired how local peculiarities of phrase and accent come about through an accidental example set by some one which struck the ears of others and was quoted and copied till at last every one in the locality chimed in just so it is with national tricks of vocalization or intonation with national manners fashions of movement and gesture and habitual expressions of face we here in america through following succession of whom it is now impossib le to trace and through inﬂuencing each other in bad direction have at last settled down collectively into what better or worse is our own characteristic national type type with the production of which so far these habits go the climate and conditions have had practically nothing at all to this type which we have thus reached by our imitativeness we now have ﬁxed upon us better or worse now type can be wholly disadvantageous but so far our type follows the fashion it can not be wholly good clou ston was certainly right in thinking that eagerness breathlessness and anxiety are not signs of strength they are signs of weakness and of bad the even forehead the cheek the codﬁsh eye may be less interesting the moment but they are more promising signs than intense expression is of what we may expect of their possessor in the long run your dull unhurried worker gets over great deal of ground because he never goes backward or breaks down your intense convulsive worker breaks down the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https bad moods so often that you never know where he may be when you most need his help may be having one of his bad days we say that so many of our countrymen collapse and have to be sent abroad to rest their nerves because they work so hard i suspect that this is an immense mistake i suspect that neither the nature nor the amount of our work is accountable the frequency and severity of our breakdowns but that their cause lies rather in those absurd feelings of hurry and having time in that breathlessness and tension that anxiety of feature and that solicitude results that lack of inner harmony and ease in short by which with us the work is so apt to be accompanied and from which europ ean who should the same work would nine times out of ten be free these perfectly wanton and unnecessary tricks of inner attitude and outer manner in us caught from the social atmosphere kept up by tradition and idealized by many the admirable way of life are the last straws that break the american camel back the ﬁnal overﬂowers of our measure of wear and tear and fatigue the voice example in surprisingly large number of us has tired and plaintive sound some of us are really tired i not mean absolutely to deny that our climate has tiring quality but far more of us are not tired at all or would not be tired at all unless we had got into wretched trick of feeling tired by following the prevalent habits of vocalization and expression and if talking high and tired and living excitedly and hurriedly would only enable us to more by the way even while breaking us down in the end it would be different there would be some compensation some excuse going on so but the exact reverse is the case it is your relaxed and easy worker who is in hurry and quite thoughtless most of the while of consequences who is your efﬁcient worker and tension and anxiety and present and future all mixed up together in our mind at once are the surest drags upon steady progress and hindrances to our success my colleague professor münsterber g an excellent observer who came here recently has written some notes on america to german papers he says in substance that the appearance of unusual energy in america is superﬁcial and illusory being really due to nothing but the habits of jerkiness and bad which we have to thank the defective training of our people i think myself that it is high time old legends and traditional opinions to be changed and that if any one should begin to write about yankee inefﬁciency and feebleness and inability to anything with time except to waste it he would have very pretty paradoxical thesis to sustain with great many facts to quote and great deal of experience to appeal to in its proof well my friends if our dear american character is weakened by all this i think whatever reserves you may make that you will agree to the main facts does the remedy lie it lies of course where lay the origins of the disease if vicious fashion and taste are to blame the thing the fashion and taste must be changed and though it is small thing to inoculate seventy millions of people with new standards yet if there is to be any relief that will have to be done we must change ourselves from race that admires jerk and snap their own sakes and looks down upon low voices and quiet ways dull to one that on the contrary has calm its ideal and their own sakes loves harmony dignity and ease so we go back to the psychology of imitation again there is only one way to improve ourselves and that is by some of us setting an example which the others may pick up and imitate till the new fashion spreads from east to west some of us are in more favorable positions than others to set new fashions some are much more striking personally and imitable so to speak but living person is sunk so low not to be imitated by somebody

nature will take care of that result now the psychological principle on which this precept reposes is law of very deep and widespread importance in the conduct of our lives and at the same time law which we americans most grievously neglect stated technically the law is this that strong feeling about one self tends to arrest the free association of one objective ideas and motor processes we get

doomed he is annihilated he is lost his mind is ﬁxed if in cramp on these feelings of his own situation and in all the books on insanity you may read that the usual varied ﬂow of his thoughts has ceased his associative processes to use the technica l phrase are inhibited and his ideas stand still shut up to their one monotonous function of reiterating inwardly the fact of the man desperate estate and this inhibitive inﬂuence is not due to the mere fact that his emotion is painful joyous emotions about the self also stop the association of our ideas saint in ecstasy is motionless and

made temporarily by some great success or piece of good fortune good good good is all we can at such times say to ourselves until we smile at our own very foolishness now from all this we can draw an extremely practical conclusion if namely we wish our trains of ideation and volition to be copious and varied and effective we must form the habit of freeing them from the inhibitive inﬂuence of reﬂection upon them of egoistic about their results such habit like other habits can be formed prudence and duty and emotions of ambition and emotions of anxiety have of course needful part to play in our lives but conﬁne them far possible to the occasions when you are making your general resolutions and deciding on your plan of campaign and keep them out of the details when once decision is reached and execution is the order of the day dismiss absolutely all responsibility and care about the outcome unclamp in word your intellectual and practical machinery and let it run free and the service it will you will be twice good who are the scholars who get rattled in the those who think of the possibilities of failure and feel the great importance of the act who are those who recite well often those who are most indifferent their ideas reel themselves out of their memory of their own accord why we hear the complaint so often that social life in new england is either less rich and expressive or more fatiguing than it is in some other parts of the world to what is the fact if fact it be due unless to the conscience of the people afraid of either saying something too trivial and

talk much in pedagogic circles about the duty of the teacher to prepare every lesson in advance to some extent this is useful but we yankees are assuredly not those to whom such general doctrine should be preached we are only too careful it is the advice i should give to most teachers would be in the words of one who is herself an admirable teacher prepare yourself in the subject so well that it shall be always on tap then in the trust your spontaneity and ﬂing away all further care my advice to students especially to would be somewhat similar just may be too tight so may one carefulness

worth many pounds of anxious study it in advance if you want really to your best at an examination ﬂing away the book the day before say to yourself i wo waste another minute on this miserable thing and i care an iota whether i succeed or not say this sincerely and feel it and go out and play or go to bed and sleep and i am sure the results next day will encourage you to use the method permanently i have heard this advice given to student by miss call whose book on muscular relaxation i quoted moment ago in her later book entitled matter of course the gospel of moral relaxation of droppi ng things from the mind and not caring is preached with equal success not only our preachers but our friends the theosophists and of various religious sects are also harping on this string and

good start might be made in the direction of changing our american mental habit into something more indifferent and strong worry means always and invariably inhibition of associations and loss of effective power of course the sovereign cure worry is religious faith and this of course you also know the turbulent billows of the fretful surface leave the deep parts of the ocean undisturbed and to him who has hold on vaster and more permanent realities the hourly vicissitudes of his personal destiny seem relatively insigniﬁcant things the really religious person is accordingly unshakable and full of equanimity and calmly ready any duty that the day may bring forth this is charmingly illustrated by little work with which i recently became acquainted the practice of the presence of god the best ruler of holy life by brother lawrence being conversations and letters of nicholas herman of lorraine translated from the french 7 i extract few passages the conversations being given in indirect discourse brother lawrence was carm elite friar converted at paris in 1666 he said that he had been footman to fieubert the treasurer and that he was great awkward fellow who broke everything that he had desired to be received into monastery thinking that he would there be made to smart his awkwardness and the faults he should commit and so he should sacriﬁce to god his life with its pleasures but that god had disappointed him he having met with nothing but satisfaction in that state that he had long been troubled in mind from certain belief that he should be damned that all the men in the world could not have persuaded him to the contrary but that he had thus reasoned with himself about it i engaged in religious life only the love of god and i have endeavor ed to act only him whatever becomes of whether i be lost or saved i will always continue to act purely the love of god i shall have this good at least that till death i shall have done all that is in to love him that since then he had passed his life in perfect liberty and continual joy the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https that when an occasion of practicing some virtue offered he addressed himself to god saying i can not this unless thou enablest and that then he received strength more than sufﬁcient that when he had failed in his duty he only confessed his fault saying to

into burgundy to buy the provision of wine the society which was very unwelcome task him because he had turn business and because he was lame and could not go about the boat but by rolling himself over the casks that however he gave himself uneasiness about it nor about the purchase of the wine that he said to god was his business he was about and that he afterward found it well performed that he had been sent into auver gne the year before upon the same account that he could not tell how the matter passed but that it proved very well so likewise in his business in the kitchen to which he had naturally great aversion having accustomed himself to everything there the love of god and with prayer upon all occasions his grace to his work well he had found everything easy during ﬁfteen years that he had been employed there that he was very well pleased with the post he was now in but that he was ready to quit that the former since he was always pleasing himself in every condition by doing little things the love of god that the goodness of god assured him he would not forsake him utterly and that he would give him strength to bear whatever evil he permitted to happen to him and therefore that he feared nothing and had occasion to consult with anybody about his state that when he had attempted to it he had always come away more perplexed the of the good brother lawrence and

seem is genuinely not to care whether you are doing it or not then possibly by the grace of god you may all at once ﬁnd that you are doing it and having learned what the trick feels like you may again

religion 8 charles proteus steinmetz the problem of is of the relations of man with the supernatural with god and immortality with the soul our personality or the ego and its existence or nonexistence after the greatest and deepest which ever confronted mankind in the present state of human knowledge science can give deﬁnite and ﬁnal conclusions on these subjects because of the limitations inherent in science we must realize that all our knowledge and information and the entire structure of science are ultimately derived from the perceptions of our senses and thereby limited in the same manner and to the same extent our sense perceptions and our intellect are limited the success or failure of scientiﬁc achievement largely depends on the extent to which we can is make our observations and conclusions indep endent of the limitations of the human mind but there are limitations inherent in the human mind beyond which our intellect can not reach and therefore science does not and can not show us the world it actually is with its true facts and laws but only it appe ars to us within the inherent limitations of the human mind the greatest limitation of the human mind is that all its perceptions are ﬁnite and our intellect can not grasp the conception of inﬁnity the same limitation therefore applies to the world it appears to our reasoning intellect and in the world of science there is inﬁnity and conceptions such god and the immortality of the ego are beyond the realm of empirical science science deals only with ﬁnite events in ﬁnite time and space and the farther we pass onward in space or time the more uncertain becomes the scientiﬁc reasoning until in trying to approach the inﬁnite we are lost in the fog of unreasonable contradiction beyond science is transcendental thus we may never know and understand the inﬁnite whether in nature in the ultimate deductions from the laws of nature in time and in space or beyond nature on such transcendental conceptions god and immortality but we may appro ach these subjects far the limitations of our mind permit reach the border line beyo nd which we can not go and so derive some unde rstanding of how far these subjects may appear nonexisting or unreasonable merely because they are beyond the limitations of our intellect there appear to two promising directions of from the complex of thought and research which in physics has culminated in the theory of relativity and second in study of the gaps found in the structure of empirical science and what they may teach us all events of nature occur in space and in time whatever we perceive whateve r record we receive through our senses always is attached to and contained in space and time but are space and time real existing things have they an absolute reality outside of our mind part or framework of nature is things that are or are they merely conception of the human mind form given by the character of our mind to the events of is to the hypothetical cause of our sense perceptions kant the greatest and most critical of all philosophers in his critique of pure reason kritik der reinen vernunft concludes that space and time have absolute existence but are is forms in which the human mind conceives his relation to nature the same idea is expressed by the goethe in his dramatic autobiography faust in the second part when he refers to the mütter to the marriage of achilles and helena outside of all time it is found in ancient time so revelation speaks of there should be time longer ὅτι χρόνος οὐκέτι ἔσται transliterated hoti chronos ouketi estai the work of the great mathematicians of the nineteenth riemann lobatschefsky fered further evidence that space is not an empirical the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https nature but conception of the mind by showing that various forms of space can be conceived differing from one another and from the form in which the mind has cast the events of nature the euclidean space finally physical science in the theory of relativity has deduced the same conclusions space and time not exist in nature by themselves empty space and empty time but their existence is only due to things and events they occur in nature they are relative in the relation between us and the events of nature so much so that they are not ﬁxed and invariable in their properties but depend upon the observer and the conditions of observation we can get an idea of how utterly our perception of nature depends on the particular form of our time conception by picturing to ourselves how nature would look if our time perception were times faster or times slower in the ﬁrst case with our sense percep tions times faster all events in nature would appear to us times slower this would then be stationary and immovable world the only motion which we could see with our eyes would be that of the cannon ball which would crawl slowly along at less than snail pace the express train going at sixty miles per hour would appear to stand still and deliberate experiment be required to discover its motion by noting its position on the track and noting it again after period of time long ﬁve minutes appears to us now we should ﬁnd its position changed by three inches it would be dangerous world there would be many objects distinguishable to the senses from other harmless with which would be dangerous even fatal and one and the same object the express train might sometimes be harmless when at rest sometimes dangerous when in motion without our senses being able to see any dif ference on the other hand with our sense perceptions times slower all events in nature would appear to us to occur times faster there would be little rest in nature and we should see plants and even stones move we should observe in period of time not longer than minute or two appear to us now plant start from seed grow up ﬂower bring fruit and die sun and moon would be luminous bands traversing the sky day and night alternate seconds of light and darkness much of nature all moving things would be invisible to us if i moved my arm it would disappear to reappear again when i held it still it would be usual occurrence to have somebody suddenly appear and just suddenly disappear from our midst or to see only part of body the vanishin g and the appearance of objects would be commo n occurrences in nature and we should speak of vanishing and appearing instead of moving and stopping collisions usually harmless with invisible objects would be common occurrences seen nature and its laws would appear to us very different from what we ﬁnd them now with our present time perception thus philosophy mathematics and physical science agree that space and time can not be entities but are conceptions of the human mind in its relation to nature but what does this mean and what conclusions follow from it the space of our conception is is extended in three directions instance the direction the direction and the direction any place or point in space thus is located relative to some other point by giving its three distances from the latter in three arbitrarily chosen directions time has only one is extends in one direction only from the past to the moment or point in time thus is located with reference to another point in time by one time distance but there is fundamental difference between our space conception and our time conception in that we can pass through time only in one direction from the past to the future while we can pass through space in any direction from north to south well from south to is time is irreversible ﬂows uniformly in one direction while space is reversible can be traversed in any direction this means that when we enter the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https in space house we can approach it pass through it leave it come back to it and the thing therefore appears permanent to us and we know even when we have left the house and not see it any more that it still exists and that we can go back to it again and enter it not so with time on approaching thing in time an event such human life it extends from point in length of an end point in the house in space extends from point in the north length of an end point in the south wall but when we pass beyond the end point of an event in death of can not go back to the event any more the event has ceased ended the life is extinct but let us imagine that the same irrevers ibility applied to the conception of is that we could move through space only from north to south and not in the opposite direction then thing in space house would not exist us until we approached it when we were approaching it it would ﬁrst appear indistinctly and more and more distinctly the nearer we approached it just an event in time does not exist until we reach the point of its beginning but may appear in anticipation in time perspective when we approach it the more distinctly the closer we approach it until we reach the threshold of the time span covered by the event and the event begins to exist the life is born so to us if we could move only from north to south the house would begin to exist only when we reached its north door that point would be the birth of the house passin g through the span of space covered by the would us be its existence its life and when we stepped out of the south door the house would cease to exist us we could never enter it and turn back to it is it would be dead and extinct just the life when we pass beyond its end point in time thus birth and death appearance and extinction of an event in time our life are the same the beginning and end point of thing in space like house but the house appears to us to exist permanently whether we are in it within the length between beginning and end point or not while the event in time our life appears to us to exist only during the length of time when we are between its beginning and its end point in time and before and after it does not exist us because we can not go back to it or ahead into it but assume time were reversible like is we could go through it in any direction there would then be such thing birth or origin and death or extinction but our life would exist permanently part or span of time just the house exists part or section of space and the question of immortality of extinction or nonexti nction by death would then be meaningless we should not exist outside of the span of time covered by our life just we not exist outside of the part of space covered by our body in space and to reach an event our life we should have to go to the part of space and to the part of time where it occurs but there would be more extinction of the life by going beyond its length in time there is extinction of house by going outside of its door and everything like human being would have four extensions or extensions in space and one in time 9 if space and time and therefore the characteristics of space and time are not real things or entities but conceptions of the human mind then those transcendental questions that of immortality after death and existence before birth are not problems of fact in nature or outside of nature but are meaningless just the question whether house exists an observer outside of the space covered by it in other words the questions of birth and death of extinction or immortality are merely the incidental results of the peculiarity of our conceptions of time the peculiarity that the time of our conceptions is irreversible ﬂows continuously at uniform rate in the same direction from the past to the future but if time has reality is not an existing entity then these transcendental problems resulting from our time conception of extinction or immortality have real existence but are really phenomena of the human mind and cease to exist if we go beyond the limitations of our mind beyond our peculiar time conception it is interesting to realize that the modern development of science in the relativity theory has proved not only that time is not real but conception but also has the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https the time of our conception does not ﬂow uniformly at constant rate from past to future but that the rate of the ﬂow of time varies with the conditions the rate of time ﬂow of an event slows down with the motion relative to the event but the conception of reversal of the ﬂow of time is more illogical than the conception of change of the rate of the ﬂow of time it is inconceivable because it is beyond the limitations of our mind thus we see that the questions of life and death of extinction and immortality are not absolute problems but merely the resul t of the limitations of our mind in its conception of time and have existence outside of us after all to some extent we conceive time reversible in the conception of historical time in history we go back in time at our will and traverse with the mind eye the times of the past and we then ﬁnd that death and extinction not exist in history but the events of history the lives of those who made history exist just much outside of the span of time of their physiological is are immortal in historical time they may fade and become more indistinct with the distance in time just things in space become more indistinct with the distance in space but they can be brought back to full clearness and distinction by again approaching the things and events the former moving through space the latter moving through the historical is by looking up and studying the history of the time the entity x scientiﬁcally life is process transformations of matter with which the chemist deals and transformations of energy with which the physicist deals are all that is comprised in the phenomenon of life and mind intellect soul personality the ego are mere functions of the process of life vanishing when this process ceases but are not part of the transformations of matter and of energy if you thus speak of mental energy it scientiﬁcally is misnomer and mind is not energy in the physical sense it is true that mental effort intellectual work is accompanied by transformations of matter chemical changes in the brain and by transformations of energy but the mental activity is not part of the energy or of the matter which is transformed but the balance of ener gy and of matter closes in the energy transformations accompanying mental activity just much energy of one form appears energy of some other form is consumed and the mental activity is part of the energy in the transformations of matter accompanying mental activi ty just much matter of one form appears matter of some other form is consumed and the mental activity is part of is neither energy nor matter has been transformed into mental activity nor has energy or matter been produced by mental activity all attempts to account the mental activity produced by the expenditure of physical energy or producing physic al is exerting forces and have failed and must fail and so must any attempt to record or observe and measure mental activity by physical is methods sensitive to the action of physical forces but what then is mind is it mere phenomenon accompanying the reactions of life and vanishing with the end of the reaction just the phenomenon of ﬂame may accompany chemical reaction and vanish when the reaction is completed or is mind an entity just like the entity energy and the entity matter but differing from either of short third entity we have compared mind with the phenomenon of ﬂame accompanying chemical reaction but after all the ﬂame is not mere phenomenon but is an entity is ener gy more than once in the apparently continuous and unbroken structure of science wide gaps have been discovered into which new sections of knowledge ﬁtted sections the existence of which had never been suspected so in mendelejef f periodic system of the elements all chemical elements ﬁtted in without continuous series except the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https missing links which were gradua lly discovered and ﬁlled in neverth eless the whole group of six noble gases from helium to emanium were discovered and ﬁtted into the periodic system at place where nobody had suspected gap one of the most interesting of such unsuspected gaps in the structure of science is the following because of its pertinency to the subject of our discussion in studying the transformations of matte r the chemist records them by equations of the form 1 2h2 o2 2h2o which means two gram molecules of hydrogen h2 2 x 2 4 grams and 1 gram molecule of oxygen o2 1 x 32 grams combine to 2 gram molecules of water vapor h2o 2 x 18 36 grams nearly hundred years chemists wrote and accepted this equation innumerable times it has been experimentally proved by combining 4 parts of hydrogen and 32 parts of oxygen to 36 parts of water vapor so that this chemical equation would appear correct and unquestionable anything can be nevertheless it is wrong or rather incomplete it does not give the whole event but omits an essential part of it and now we write it 2 2h2 o2 2h2o which means the matter and energy of 2 gram molecules of hydrogen and the matter and energy of 1 gram molecule of oxygen combine to the matter and energy of 2 gram molecules of water vapor and joules or units of free ener gy hundred years the chemists thus saw only the material transforma tion represented by equation 1 but overlooked and did not recognize the energy transformation coincident with the transformation of matter though every time the experiment was made the of energy in equation 2 made themselves felt ﬂame heat and mechanical force sometimes even explosively shattering the container in which the experiment was made but the ﬂame and the explosion appeared only an incidental phenomenon without signiﬁc ance it represents and contains part of the matter but equation 1 gives the complete balance of matter in transformation it was much later that the scientists realized the signiﬁcance of the ﬂame accompanying the material transformation not mere incidental phenomenon but the manifestation of the entity energy permanent and indestructible like matter and the complete equation 2 appeared giving the balance of energy well the balance of is coincident with the transformation of matter is transformation of energy and both are indissoluble from each other either involves the other and both may be called different aspects of the same phenomenon but we have seen when mental activity occurs in our mind chemical and physical transformations accompany it are coincident with it and apparently indissolubl from it does there possibly exist the same relation between mental activity and the transformations of energy and matter we have seen to exist between the latter two are mental activity energy transformation and transformation of matter three aspects of the same biochemical phenomenon if nearly hundred years equation 1 was considered complete until we found that one side was incomplete and arrived at the more complete equation 2 the question may well be raised is equation 2 complete dealing it does with two entities matter and energy or is it not possibly still incom plete and third entity should appear in the equation an entity x i may call it differing from energy and from matter just energy and matter differ from each other and therefore not recognizable and measurable by the means which measure energy or matter just energy can not be measured by the same means matter the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https is the complete equation of transformation would read 3 2h2 o2 2h2o j x involving all three entities matter energy and mind pertaining respectively to the realm of chemistry of physics and of psychology or possibly broader science of which psychology is one branch there is scientiﬁc evidence whatsoever of the existence of such third entity x but all our deductions have been by analogy which proves is by speculation dreaming and unavoidably in these conceptions we are close to the border line of the human mind where logical reasoning loses itself in the fog of contradiction but at the same time there is evidence against the conception of an entity x it is not illogical at least more so than all such general conceptions more so than instance that of energy or of matter empirical science deals with energy and matter and entity x is neither it could not be observed by any of the methods of experimental physics or chemistry if mind is third entity correlated with the entities of energy and of matter we should expect that mental activity or entity x should occur not only in the highly complex transformations of energy and of matter taking place in the brains of the highest orders of living beings but that entity x should appear in all reactions just energy transformations always occur in transformations of matter and inversely but this seems not so and in most of the transformations of energy and of matter entity x does not appear however we have satisfactory means of recognizing entity x methods of studying it therefore it may well be that it is noticed only in those rare instances when it appears of high intensity but in most reactions entity x may be so small or appear in such way to escape observation by the means and by the methods now available like energy or matter entity x may have many forms in which it is not recognized by us just long time the ﬂame was not recognized the entity energy to illustrate again by analogy in many transformations of matter indeed in most of the more complex ones of the organic world the concurrent energy transformation is of such slowness and of such low intensity that it appears nonexisting and can be discovered and measured only by the delicate experiments devised by science furthermore the energy may appear in different forms thus the of energy in equation 2 may appear heat or electrical energy or combination of heat light sound and mechanical energy now assume that we could observe and notice only one of the forms of instance only electrical energy we should then ﬁnd that in the equation 1 we only sometimes get is electrical special peculiar conditions but usually not seem to get any of the entity energy simply because we not recognize it in the form in which it appears analogously there might be term of entity x in all transformations even such simple ones equation 3 but entity x may appear in far different simpler form it would mean that mind is only one form of entity x perhaps the form it appears in highly complex reactions in the simpler processes of nature entity x also would appear but in other simpler forms it would mean that things such mind and intellect are not limited to the higher living beings but characteristics akin thereto would be found grading down throughout all living and inanimate nature this does not appear unreasonable when we consider that some characteristics of life are found throughout all nature even in the crystal which in its mother liquor repairs lesion heals wound or which in the colloidal solution may be poisoned by prussic acid assume then that mind intellect personality the ego were forms of third entity an entity x correlated in nature with the entities energy and matter then just energy and matter continuously change their forms so with the transformations of energy and of matter entity x would continuously change disappear in one form and reappear in another form entity x could therefore not exist permanently in one and the same form and the permanency of the is still be illogical would not exist within the realm of science but would carry us beyond the limitations of the the project gutenberg ebook of book of exposition edited by homer heath nugent https into the unknowable permanency of the is individual would require form of entity x in which it is not further transformable this would be the case if the transformations of entity x are not completely reversible but tend one deﬁnite direction from lower to higher forms and the latter thus would gradually build up to increasing permanency there is nothing unreasonable in this but similar the reverse with the transformations of energy they also are not completely reversible but tend in deﬁnite direction from higher to lower heat energy the increase of entropy by the second law of thermodynamics thus in inﬁnite time the universe should come to standstill in spite of the law of conservation of energy by all energy becoming unavailable further is becoming dead energy if entity x existed could it not also have become unavailable further transformation by reaching its maximum form and thus become not susceptible to further is immortal the unavailable heat of the physicist is immortal and not capable of further transformation here we are again in the fog of illogic beyond the limitations however it sounds familiar to the nirvana of the buddhist physics and chemistry obviously could not deal with entity x and the most delicate and sensitive physical or chemical instruments could get indication of it and all attempts at investigation by physical or chemical means thus must be doomed to failure but such investigations of entity x belong to the realm of the science of psychology or rather broader science of which psychology is one branch dealing with one form of entity x mind just instance is one branch of the broader science of physics dealing with electric al energy while physics deals with all forms of energy in concluding i wish to say that nothing in the preceding speculations can possibly encourage spiritism or other on the contrary from the preceding it is obvious that the alleged manifestations of spiritism must be fake or since they are manifestations of energy entity x if it exists certainly is not energy and therefore could not manifest itself such
