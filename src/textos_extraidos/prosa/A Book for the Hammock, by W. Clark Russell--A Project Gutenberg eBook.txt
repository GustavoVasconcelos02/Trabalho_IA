made by distance shone with most exquisi dainty distinctness in the lenses of the telescope i levelled at it the vessel showed every cloth she had spars and booms and leaned very lightly from the wind

knocked at the door and demanded to know why such word was put up the reason was explained but to purpose and the french ambassador in order to get rid of these jolly tars ordered concord to be taken down and replaced by the word amity it is to illiteracy of this kind that we are indebted much of the romantic superstitions of the sea in olden days the forecastle was certainly very unlettered and the wonderful imaginings of the early navigators whose imperfect gaze and enormous credulity coined marvels and miracles out of things we now deem in the highest degree prosaic and commonplace descended without obstruction of learning or scepticism through the marine generations it is easily seen on reading the old how most of the superstitions had their birth and it needs but very superﬁcial acquaintance with the nautical character to understa nd why they should have been perpetuated into comparatively enlightened times two capital instances occur to and they are both to be found in the narrative of cowley s voyage round the world in the years 1683 84 85 and 86 the ﬁrst relates to the old practice of choosing valentines we came abreast with cape horn says the author on 14 1684 where we chusing of valentines and discoursing of the intrigues of women there arose prodigious storm which did continue to the last day of the month driving us into the latitude of 60 deg and 30 min south which is further than any ship hath sailed before south so that we concluded the discoursing of women at sea very unlucky and occasioned the that such superstition this ever obtained footing among mariners i will not declare yet it is easily seen that the conclusion the author arrived at that the discoursing of women at sea is very unlucky might engender superstition strong enough to live through centuries in the same book is recounted another strange matter of true pattern on june 29 1686 there had been great feasting on board cowley s ship and when the commanders of the other vessels departed they were saluted with some guns which on arriving on board their ships they returned but says the author it is strangely observable that whilst they were loading their guns they heard voice in the sea crying out come help come help man overboar d which made them forthwith bring their ships to thinking to take him up but heard more of the captains were so puzzled that they returned to cowley s ship to see if he had lost man but we nor the other ship had not man wanting upon strict examination we found that in all the three ships we had our complement of men which made them all to conjecture that it was the spirit of some man that had been drowned in that latitude by thus they resolved their perplexity braced up their yards and pursued their course in composed

exhalation which in gales of wind or in dead calms blazes at the end of yards or hovers in bulbous shinings upon the mastheads one readily sympathizes with the old superstitions here to the ancient

clung so obstinately to the skirts of the running ship that its identity became in day or two distinguishable thing amongst the other of like kind that pursued the vessel one day this huge bird was hovering at short elevation above the taffrail it was noticed that an object about the size of dollar was suspended from its neck glasses were brought to bear but nothing could be made of the great bird s embellishment thereupon everybody grew eager to catch the creatu re and hook was forthwith baited with piece of pork and towed astern some of the other albatrosses were caught but the desired one was not to be entrapped it would sail with sweep to over the bait that hissed throu gh the water poise itself on magniﬁce nt length of tremulous pinion whilst its eyes glowing like cairngorm

birds not appear to have inspired maritime fancy to any marked degree the belief of old sailors that if an albatross be slaughtered it at once becomes necessary to keep one s weather eye lifting squalls but that harm follows if the bird be caught with piece of fat pork and is allowed to die natural death on deck about sums up the traditionary apprehensions in respect of the bird yet this meagreness of forecastle imagination is strange assuredly the albatross is the pinioned monarch of the deep the majestic and beautiful eagle of the liquid crags and steeps of the ocean and will days so haunt the wakes of ships to impart just that element of the familiar into the wild and desolat freedom of the cold grey skies and billows of dominion which especially fertilizes the fancy of the mariner who needs something of the prosaic to hold on by just in the same way that he swings by rope high aloft in the middle air nevertheless it is true that there are scores of comparatively insigniﬁcant sea and land birds whose feathers are supposed to cover larger powers good or evil than even the albatross the common here surely is strange little fowl of the air to parallel nay to surpass the wizard powers of the shrieking monarch of the horn and the southern ocean and yet it is gravely asserted that should sparrows be blown away to sea and alight upon ship they are not to be taken or even chased in proportion the birds are molested must sail be shortened to provide against the storm that will certainly come in the interests of humanity nothing could be better than such superstitions the harmless and beautiful gull whose lovely sweepin gs and curvings through the air whose exquisite capacity in the teeth of living gale whose bright eyes salt shrewd voice and webbed feet folded in bosom of ermine it is impossible to sufﬁciently admire though there be unhappily lack of nathaniel winkles who regard this pretty creature mark set up by nature cockneys to shoot at has commercial virtue that sets it high in the long shoreman s catalogue of things to be approved when this bird appears in great numbers then is its presence accepted an infallible sign of the neighbourhood of herring shoals herman melville has somewhere said that in his time it was reckoned bad omen ravens to perch on the mast of ship at the cape of good hope we know that the raven himself was hoarse that croaked the fatal entrance of duncan and there is reason forecastle reason at least why the should not have ravens harnessed to his chariot after the manner of the doves of venus though why these plumed steeds are peculiarly obnoxious to mariners at or of f the cape of good hope is not certainly known it was an old superstition that the rotten timbers of foundered ships generated birds 9 when says very early english naturalist this old wrack of ships falls in the sea it is rotted and corrupted by the sea and from this decay breeds birds hanging by the beaks to the wood and when they are all covered with plumage and are large and fat then they fall into the sea and then god in his grace restores them to their natural it will thus be seen how intimate is the association between sailors and birds particularly the kind of bird produced by rotten and sunken timber and styled by the above very early english naturalist crabans or cravans though barnacles perhaps is the term to best ﬁt the prodigy even dead bird may prove soothsayer according to jack says he if kingﬁsher be suspended to the mast by its beak it will swing its breast in the direction of the coming wind easier even than whistling breeze and weathercock worth the lordliest and more ﬂashing of ecclesiastical vanes which will only tell how the wind is actually blowing this is vulgar error in sir thomas browne s list but not exploded by that eloquent worthy nay he rather explains it by remarking that kingﬁsher hanged by the bill showeth what quarter the wind is by an occult and secret property converting the breast to that part of the horizon from whence the wind doth blow this is received opinion and very strange introducing natural weathercocks39 book the hammock by clark

agreed that if kite perched on mast the omen was favourable one crow lighting on ship is accepted by the chinese sure sign of prosperous gales and they feed the bird with crumbs of bread by way of

magpies but twice and once i nearly lost my vessel and afterwards i fell off my horse and was it is said that ﬁshermen in the english channel attribute the east wind to the ﬂight of curlew on dark nights it is possible that such superstition may exist nor could far wilder fancy be held by one who in midnight darkness upon the has heard the dismal wailings and cryings of invisible birds speeding

all that the albatross remains the sovereign of the seas and unless the average duration of its life is already positively known the discovery made in 1886 of the bird with the compass at its neck

foundation in truth he examines sir humphry davy s arguments against the likelihood of the existence of such an object mermaid and agrees with that distinguished philosopher s view that human head

bathing in the sea in the month of january will seem strange to persons whose blood ﬂows languidly but there is more to wonder at in the following particulars whilst miss mackay and another lady were walking by the shore they perceived three people who were on rock at some distance showing signs of astonishment and terror on approaching the ladies saw that the object of their wonder was face resembling the human countenance ﬂoating on the waves the sea ran high and the waves advanced the mermaid gently sank under them and afterwards reappeared the face was plump and round the nose small

struck his ﬂag thrice meaning that the spaniards well others should conclude that by continuing to wear his ﬂag he represented sovereignty of the sea complete that of the english sir william requeste d him to take in his ﬂag he refused alleging that he had struck it three times which he held was acknowledgment enough there was some discussion after which he was told that if he did not salute the british admiral would weigh anchor and fall down to him and then the force of the ships should determine the question rather than i would suffer his ﬂag to be worn in view of so many nations were to behold it i resolved to bury myself in the the admiral it seems on better advice adds sir william took in his ﬂag and stood immediately off to sea ﬁring gun the rest of the ﬂeet to follow him and thus i lost my guest the next day at dinner he had amongst others who witnessed this was sciriago the spanish general who told sir william that if the hollanders had worn their ﬂag times had strangely altered in england he remembered his old master king philip the second being shot at by the lord admiral of england wearing his ﬂag in the narrow seas when he came to marry queen mary in spite of treaties of peace between england and holland the trouble about the ﬁshing continued disputes arose over the payment of the in scotland and the dutch sent ships of war to protect their against the penalties which must attend the refusal to pay the licence money in 1609 king james issued proclamation68 69 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https ﬁshing in which it was

does not appear that the honour of the ﬂag was involved in these trawling politic s until in that year commodore young encountered dutch whose captain refused to salute the english colours the commodore sent boat with polite request that the dutchman would strike but mynheer answered very honestly that the states had threatened to take off his head if he struck whereupon ﬁght began with the result that the dutchman had to haul down his colours this was on may 14 on the 19th van tromp bore down upon blake who was lying off dover blake sent three shots at the dutch ﬂag hint which tromp answered with broadside and then followed an action that lasted till nine at night when blake being reinforced the dutch made off peace was made in in that treaty nothing was said to our sovereignty in respect to the ﬁsheries but amongst other article s was the acknowledgment of the dominion of the english at sea and the agreement to strike to the meteor bunting but the prowess of admiral blake may have provided this without any obligation of speciﬁcation in this year coming to an anchor off cadiz dutch admiral who was there would not hoist his ﬂag whilst blake was present indeed such was the awe in which blake was held that the algerines merely with the idea of obtaining his favour made point of overhauling the sallee rovers english prisoners and sending all they found to him the

compliment which lawson refused to return alleging that his orders did not allow him to strike to the subjects of any king or state whatever it may be supposed that such treatment pretty liberally enven omed the soul of the ﬁne old dutchman who when he was shortly afterwards sent to commit hostilities against us made sail on that adventure with hot heart in 1674 we ﬁnd the dutch in the treaty of peace professing to understand point that in spite of previous treaties they had refused to admit in the treaty with cromwell they had agreed that their ships should salute the english and in subsequent treaties the same undertaking appears but their usual apology failure was that striking was mere matter of civility and that if they declined to pull off their hat there was obligation upon them to so but by 1674 the political atmosphere had been cleared by british cannons and the dutch were now able to distinguish the treaty ended the doubt what was before styled courtesy was here confessed right not only was the extent of the british sovereignty clearly deﬁned the state undertook that whole ﬂeets well separate ships should strike their sails to any ﬂeet or single ship carrying

command of the french ﬂeet in the west indies should be offered him on this the duke invited rodney to spend some weeks with him and one morning whilst strolling about the grounds sounded the admiral on the subject rodney not catching the duke s drift thought him deranged and began to eye him with some alarm eventually biron came out boldly with the proposal those says the biographer who remember the worthy admiral and can recollect the counte nance he would assume when anything unexpectedly broke upon him may imagine his aspect and demeanour he answered thus my distresses it is true have

much obliged all these penalties and punishments it is on record that information having been laid against some persons living in dorsetshire harbouring smuggled tea their houses were searched and there were found about thirty pounds of tea mixed with leaves and one thousand and thirty pounds weight of ash elder and sloe leaves dried and prepared ready mixing with the tea this was about the

of cornwall he saw sloop lying at anchor the people of which hailed him and asked him whose boat it was he answered that it was king s boat they warned him not to approach if he did they would ﬁre on him he was then some eight or ten fathoms distant from the sloop his men nothing daunted continued to row whilst he held the revenue colours in his hand the smugglers ﬁred volley from their muskets slipped their cable and made off one of the men in the boat was killed the smugglers were apprehended on the evidence of one of their own people this man named tom rogers said that he was sailor on

the william that was captured by privateer off bridlington all the crew except three were taken out and ﬁve frenchmen put on board the three englishmen found means to choke the pumps with ashes and made the frenchmen believe the vessel was sinking sooner than go to the bottom they agreed to make the nearest port and eventually they carried the william to sunderland the frenchmen i read were

the scufﬂe the steersman fell overboard and was drowned the other three were aloft the english captain taking the helm ordered them to remain aloft or he would shoot them in this manner he steered the vessel all night and next morning sighting an english frigate signalled and was brought safely to port by her there is something not little humorous in the thought of those three frenchmen hanging on aloft all night the smuggling britisher at the helm steering with one hand and with the other covering them with pistol these are but plum or two from pudding very rich with such fruit somehow the

what he knew of the enemy hawke said if he was right he would make his fortune but that if he lied he would hang him at the the ﬂeet was instantly under weigh and by paulet s directions was presently brought between the enemy and the french coast the admiral then ordered paulet into his own vessel but the bold smuggler begged leave to remain that he might assist in beating the enemy this favour was granted station was assigned to paulet who fought like gamecock and when the battle was over he was sent home with pocket full of letters of commendation and subsequently rewarded in such manner

not mean to spread over nor in my judgment does spenser employ it in that sense in the triplet that johnson appends loofed gone to loofed in johnson s day denoted ship that had put her helm down to come closer to the wind keel the bottom of the doubt the keel is at the bottom of the ship but sailors would more understand it ship s bottom than they would accept the word beam deﬁnition of the word johnson gives helm the steerage the rudder it is plain that he is here under the impress ion that steerage is pretty much the same in reality the helm is more the rudder than it is the tiller the

mend rope by laying one end over another to belay rope is to make it fast 34 bailey correctly deﬁnes this word to fasten any running rope so that when it is haled it can not run out either johnson doubted bailey whom he quotes nevertheless an authority or consulted him his at capricious intervals these examples could be multiplied but it is not my purpose to criticize samuel johnson s dictionary yet it is admittedly the basis of most of the dictionaries in use it is worth while calling attention to errors which have survived without question or correction into the later compilations these and the like blunders merely indicate the extreme difﬁculty that confronts not indeed the i nowhere discover any signs of research in the direction of marine the plain deﬁner of nautical words the truth is before man undertakes to explain the language of sailors he should go to sea it is only by mixing with sailors by hearing and executing orders that one can distinguish the shades of meaning amidst the scores of subtleties of the mariner s speech it is of course hard to explain what the sailor himself could not deﬁne save by the word he himself employs take example inboard and you say of man entering ship that he has gone aboard her of boat hanging at the davits that it must be swung there is nicety here difﬁcult of discrimination but it is ﬁxed nevertheless you woul d not say of man in ship that he is inboard nor of davits that they must be slewed so of aft and they both mean the same thing but they are not applied in the same way man is aft when he is on the quarter or poop you could not say he is but suppose him to be beyond the you would say he is standing abaft the not he is standing aft peculiarities of expression abound in to degree not to be paralleled by the eccentricities of other vocational dialects man who sleeps in his bunk or hammock all night or through his watch on deck lies in or sleeps but neither term is applicable if he sleeps

yourselves aft etc at all events lay is an active verb at sea and means it is however used in other senses to lay up rope the ship lay along the old expression vessel pressed down by the force of the wind other terms strike the ear singular contradictions such to make land to fetch such and such place to reach it by sailing but properly to arrive at it by means of beating or tacking jump aloft run aloft tumble up come up from below bear hand look sharp make haste handsomely in the expression lower away handsomely meaning lower away with judgment but promptly bully term of kindly greeting bully you 35 this and other terms must now be called americanisms but they are americanisms only are other old words which the people of the united states have preserved from the language of their english forefathers but which on this side of the water are obsolete or employed with different meaning the difﬁculties of the lexicographer desiring the inclusion of nautical terms in his list are not little increased by the sailor s love of contractions or his perversities of pronunciation let cite few examples the word treenail wooden118 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https

sesquipedalianism if there be long word it must be shortened somehow to spring to jump to leap to tumble to keep his eyes skinned to hammer his ﬁngers into these are the things required of jack he dances he sings he drinks he is in all senses lively hearty but underlying his intellectual and physical caper is deep perception of the sea mighty force remorseless foe the matter seems triﬂing yet the national character is in it great number of words are used by sailors which are extremely disconcerting to landsmen apparently sheer violations of familiar sounds and the images they convey to lash ashore this is to beat with whip to thrash at sea it means to make anything fast by securing it with rope to foul when sailor speaks of one thing fouling another he does not intend to say that one thing soils or dirties another but that it has got mixed in manner to make separation difﬁculty our ship drove and fouled vessel line is foul when it is twisted when it jams in block seize is to attach it does not mean to seizing is the line or lanyard or small stuff by which anything is made fast whip this word naturally conveys the idea of the implement ﬂogging driving in reality it

leach or leech may be taken meaning the cut sides of the sail leach also meant hard of such terms these how is the etymology to be come at the name of the animal might have been suggested in few cases in lizard perhaps by some dim or fanciful resemblance to it in the object that wanted title but monkey fox cat and other such appellations must have an origin referable to any other cause than that of their likeness to the creatures they are called after it is possible that these names may be corruptions from saxon and other terms expressive of totally different meaning it will120 121 book the

fake french sennit etc the derivatives of some words are suggested by their sounds bowse pronounced bowce is familiar call at sea bowse it taut lads take and bowse upon those halliards the men pull off upon the rope and bow it by their action it is therefore conceivable that bowse may have come from bow 37 dowse pronounced dowce signiﬁes to lower to haul down suddenly also to extin guish dowse the glim put out the the french word douce is probably the godfather here but rouse pronounced rouce rouse it aft boys it means to drag smartly does it really signify what it looks to rouse up the object that is to be handled it is wonderful to note how on the whole the language of the sea has preserved its substance and sentiment through the many generations of seafarers down to the present period of iron plates and steel masts of the propeller and the steam engine the reason is that great has been the apparent change wrought in the body and fabric of ships since the days of the great harry of the sixteenth century and the royal geor ge of the eighteenth century the nomenclature of remote times still perfectly answers to mass of nautical essentials more especially regards the masts yards rigging and sails of vessel and another reason lies in the strong conservative spirit of the sailor there was loud outcry when the admiralty many years ago condemned the term larbo ard and ordered the word port to be substituted the name was not to be abandoned without violent struggle and many throes of prejudice on the part of the old salts what was good enough hawkins duncan howe rodney nelson was surely good enough their successors old dictionaries give to bowse meaning to drink the correct etymology might lie in this direction not in many directions i ﬁnd new readings of old terms rule where the feature has disappeared the term has gone with it where the expression is retained the meaning is more or less identical with the original words few exceptions may be quoted bittacle was anciently the name of the binnacle obviously derived from the french habitacle small habitation caboose was formerly the name of the galley or kitchen of small merchantmen falconer spells it coboose and describes it sort of box or house to cover the chimney of some merchant ships previous to the introduction of the caboose the furnaces cooking were in placed on the middle deck in ships in the forecastle and adds my authority the anonymous author of treatise on shipbuilding written in 1701 also in all ships which have forecastles the provisions are there cuddy is forcible word that has been replaced by the mincing affected term in the last century it signiﬁed sort of cabin or cookroom in the or near the stern of lighter or barge of it is curious to note the humble origin of term

whoever were the inventors writes sir walter raleigh in discou rse of shipping included in his genuine remains we ﬁnd that every age hath added somewhat to ships and to all things else and in mine own time the shape of our english ships hath been greatly bettered it is not long since the striking of the wonderful ease to great ships both at sea and in harbour hath been devised together with the chain pump which takes up twice much water the ordinary did we have lately added the bonnet and the drabler to the courses we have devised studding sails topgallant sails topsails the weighing of anchors by the capstone is also new we have fallen into consideration of the length of cables and by it we resist the malice of the greatest winds that can blow although this passage has reference to improvements made in the fabrics of ships during the closing years of the reign of queen elizabeth and of the opening of that of james it is curious illustrative of the conservatism of the sailor that by omitting the these words of raleigh might stand the ships of sailor unacquainted with the archæology of his own calling would believe that the sail the bonnet the drabbler the the and even the sail that was in use down to so late period the close of the ﬁrst quarter of the present century were old raleigh s certainly the terms given by sir walter would furnish us with clue to the paternity of these cloths example falconer derives it from scud stead or steady i am inclined to think it is derived from the verb to stud adorn to cover but not necessarily john son says with studs or shining it is quite conceivable to think of lifted over ruff in admiration of canvas that raises the cry by r lady but she is now studded with sail assuredly we moderns woul d not regard steadying sail in any sense of the word the bonnet mentioned by raleigh is an additional piece of canvas made to lace on to the foot of sail the term bonnet applied to thing worn at the foot advises us of an ironical derivative but of drabbler the etymology is obvious to drabble is to wet to befoul now the drabbler is an additional piece of canvas laced to the bonnet and necessarily coming very low unquestionably takes its name from drabbling wet the and are among the vanishe d details so indeed is the which may be said to have been conquered like cold young virgin by the invention of whiskers booms or irons

may be accepted metaphorically expressing the action of rounding into the wind in the direction of the tacks topgallant says johnson is proverbially applied to anything elevated or splendid and quotes from l estrange i dare appeal to the consciences of topgallant prior to the introduc tion of topgallant sails there was nothing higher than the topsails taking topgallant of proverbial application to whatever is elevated if not splendid one easily sees how the topgallant fabric of sail mast and the name it is known by to luff is to put the helm down so to bring the vessel closer to the wind this

course of my reading i lighted upon description of of 1712 in which it is stated that the lady s hole is place the gunner s small stores built between the partners of the mainmast and looked after by man named lady who is put in by turns to keep the terms of this kind are revelations in their way showing the most part the sort of road the marine philologist must take in his search after originals

the etymology of certain peculiarly nautical expressions in common use on shipboard must be entirely conjectu ral take swig off to pull upon perpendicular rope the end of which is led under the old readings give it swag off swagging the motion of this sort of pulling is of swaggering kind and i have little doubt that the expression of swig or swag comes from 41 tail on tally on the order more men to haul upon rope possibly expresses its origination with some clearness tail on the tail of pullers tally on men in countable way it is usual to speak of ship being under it should i think be

the following nor here know well what it means whoe er offends at some unlucky time slides in verse or hitches in so writes johnson had he looked into the old voyages he would have found hitch

riggers that also old ships had their rigging reﬁtted at the same place and that matthew walker was the inventor of the lanyard knot now known by the inventor s name wherever ship it has been

by electric lights table elegantly and hospitably furnished that of any hotel ashore numerous waiters to ﬂy at his bidding comfortable bedroom ﬁtted with wove mattrass and hair bed he may quench his

there is nothing in head winds or boisterous weather to detain her and she commonly arrives at her destination before she is due fielding s ship was vessel not at all unlike one of the scores of sailing colliers which to this day go on staggering down the north sea laden with coals from newcastle or sunderland her master was so great rufﬁan that fielding has drawn the ﬁgure of completer character of that kind in any of his novels not excepting jonathan when the novelist ventured mildly to complain of the long detention at rotherhithe this brutal skipper in whose mouth every other word was an oath declared that had he known and fielding were not to be pleased he would not have carried them ﬁve hundred pounds he added says fielding many asseverations that he was gentleman and despised money not forgetting several hints of the presents which had been made him his cabin of twenty thirty and forty guineas by several gentlemen over and above the sum which they had the size and comfort of the accommodation may be conjectured from what fielding says of the captain s snoring he loved to indulge himself in morning slumbers which were attended with much more agreeable to the performer than to the hearers especially such have i had the privilege of sitting in the orches the passage money was ﬁve pounds head and it was expected that passengers fed themselves fielding

agonies of it is well that those days are dead and gone hundreds of us are every year going abroad health of embarking on that painful quest the invalid of century ago ship of probably hundred tons burden commanded by pitiless bully and worked by men who to use fielding s own expression seemed to glory in the language and behaviour of savages it is fair to admit however that much of the misery endured by the passenger was in those and later times limited to the short service ships it is true that on the american route the vessels contin ued small and wretched down to the present century instance you read of two hundred highland emigrants embarking boston in kind of one hundred and forty tons few years ago i was in company with an old gentleman who pointing to small barque lying moored alongside wharf told that he sailed to new york in her in 1836 and that she was esteemed commodious passenger even in those days 47 but it must be admitted that at the period of fielding s voyage there were ships trading to the east and west indies of bulk and beauty which migh t justly entitle them still to admiration the craft of both the dutch and east india compa nies were capacious and seaworthy ships of the state their forecastle companies were abundantly and highly disciplined their commanders of the roughly polite type excellently represented by the heroic old commodore dance their s or great cabins were exceedingly handsome apartments plentifully embellished with carpets mirrors ﬂowers panels and in other ways richly decorated such were the ships which carried clive and hastings and such they remained down to the time of the ﬁne old earl of balcarres the following lines published in 1832 and therefore referring to shipboard life of date comparatively recent

much need of comfort and security passengers embarking on long voyage and that more misery could be packed into the run between dover and calais than could be found in journey of three years round the

ingenious but it is not every captain who would relish the thought of an unsinkable chest full of gold and jewels hanging at his davits ready to the hand of the ﬁrst daring jack who should depend upon black night and the navigable qualities of the chest to come safely off with few hundreds of thousands of pounds yet what pickings the deep would have still the money and jewels carried by ships were

drowned and his body was never again seen the other two discovering that the bulkhead between the forecastle and the hold was started and that the cargo had fallen down on the deck drew themselves towards the stern of the ship with their faces close to the kelson when the vessel capsized the captain mate and boy were in the cabin the mate wrenched open the trap hatch in the deck cleared vacant space there and then scrambling up into it he took the boy from the hands of the captain whom he assisted to follow them in about an hour they were joined by the two men from forward who managed to scrape along the kelson to where they were they are now descr ibed ﬁve individuals closely cooped together so that they sat they were obliged to bend their bodies want of height above them whilst the water reached high their waists the only relief they could obtain was by one of them at time stretching at full length on the barrels in the hold taking care however to keep close to the kelson where the air was the 17th and 18th passed they were without food and without water and might be supposed from their situation certainly doomed if they already lay dead at the bottom of the sea they could distinguish between day and night by the light in the sea that was reﬂected up from the cabin skylight and thence into the space where they lay through the hatch in the cabin ﬂoor in the middle of wednesday night the 18th the vessel struck at the third blow the stern dropped to such an extent that the men were forced forward towards the bows whilst making their way one of them fell down through the cabin ﬂoor and skylight and was drowned they noticed presently that the water was ebbing on which the mate dropped into the cabin to seek hatchet that they might cut their way out but the water suddenly rising he had to ﬂy again to his former shelter at last the day dawned and then perceiving point of rock sticking into the vessel they knew that she was hard and fast ashore the quarter of the ship being stove the captain looked through the rent there and cried out in french thank god my children we are saved i see man on the shortly afterwards the man approached and put in his hand

desperation of dying man almost incessantly two days and one night to cut hole with his knife through the hull the knife broke but this the hole would have been made with the result that the vessel must have instantly foundered owing to the liberation of the air that alone kept her buoyant second it was afterwards shown that during the afternoon of wednesday the 18th the wreck had been fallen in

or sink those who are inside her may choose this is by means the ﬁrst of her kind in 1801 fulton experimented with what he called or at rouen the ﬁrst account of this invention says that the boat sank and rose seven or eight times the longest period during which it remained under water was eight minu tes the machine was entered by means of an opening shaped like tunnel when those who conducted the experiment wished to descend into the river and disappear they let down this opening and lost all communication with the external air the inventors of this ingenious machine are americans the principal of whom is called fulton three of them went into the boat and remained during the experiment the prefect and vast concourse of specta tors were 54 fuller account written by aubin was printed

the crew to live under water eight hours the boat was of sufﬁcient strength to plunge one hundred feet deep and to bear the pressure of water at that depth she was furnished with two sails and when above water presented the appearance of an ordinary boat fulton in making his experiments at havre not only remained an hour under water with his companions but held his boat parallel to the horizon at any given depth he proved the correctly under water on the surface and while under water the boat made way at half league an hour by means contrived that at this point aubin indulges in the follo wing prophetical exclamation it is not twenty years since all europe was astonished at the ﬁrst ascension of men in balloons perhaps in few years they will not be less surprised to see ﬂotilla of diving boats which on given signal shall to avoid the pursuit of an enemy plunge under water and rise again several leagues from the place where they descended the invention of balloons has hitherto been of advantage because means have been found to direct their course but if such means could be discovered what would become of camps cannon fortresses and the whole art of war he then proceeds to point out that fulton s craft has the advantage of sailing like common boat and also of diving when it is pursued it was therefore ﬁt carrying secret orders to succour blockaded port and to examine the force and position of an enemy in their own harbours he further tells us that fulton had already added to his boat machine by means of which he blew up large craft in the port of brest he concludes what will become of maritime wars and where will sailors be found to man ships of war when it is physical certainty that they may every moment be blown into the air by means of against which human foresi ght could guard them aubin does not say how the boat was sunk and raised and how it was propelled when sunk at the rate of mile and half in an hour but that fulton invented such boat the frenchman describes is indisputable and it is equally certain that although its merit an invention was remarkable nothing came of it naval chronicle fulton however was not the ﬁrst in 1774 man named

consider that though the obligation of having on all occasions to struggle against weather helm must weigh heavy on life whose essential condition is one of ﬁns yet being ﬁsh it is better to be

in the beginning of the seventeenth century one peter jansen dutch merchant ordered ship to be built him on the lines of noah s ark of course this vessel was designed to contain only few animals and those chieﬂy men her size was not that of her famous prototype the dutchman s orders were that the vessel should exactly answer proportionally to the dimensions of the fabric that was stranded on ararat jansen ﬂourished in times but this notion of his went so far beyond the most extravagant credulities of the period that the scheme was viewed mere fanatical whim of mennonite to which sect our friend belonged he persevered however in spite of being heartily jeered at more particularly by the seafaring folk who assembled to view the shipwrights at work but when the vessel was eventually launched it was discovered that ships built in this manner were in times of peace commodious above all others because they would convey more cargo than other holds and yet be navigated by the same number of hands which other forecastles carried those who would hear more of this ark may consu they can ﬁnd bibliotheca biblia vol i 62 the story is there related peter jansen dutch merchant caused ship to be built him answering in its respective proportions to those of noah s ark at ﬁrst this ark was looked upon better than fanatical vision of this jansen but afterwards it was discovered that ships built in this manner were in times of peace beyond all others most commodious etc that jansen erred according to the light of his times who shall declare sir thomas browne who lived much about that period would not say he noah s ark was the swiftest vessel that ever drove keel through than the baltimore clippers the mediterranean fruiters the slavers of the spanish main in fact very nearly fast the atlantic expresses which storm through the ocean between the mersey and new york i ﬁnd in the extracts from commonplace books in browne s works this passage whether noah might not be the ﬁrst man that compassed the globe since if the ﬂood covered the whole earth and lands appeared to hinder the current he must be carried with the wind and current according to the sun and so in the space of the deluge might near make the tour of the globe and since if there were continent of america and all that tract sea ship setting out from africa without other help would at last fall upon some part of india or this is much to say that noah sailed round the world in forty days smart work when you consider that it takes days to steam to new zealand it can not however be concluded from her dimensions that even though blown along by gale of wind right over her stern the ark equalled the speed of union or royal mail steamer sir walter raleigh in his history of the world mine of exquisite thought and of sweet and noble expression devotes page or two to consideration of the size and form of noah s ship and what man who was great sailor he was poet philosopher and soldier and who lived near to jansen s time has to say of her must be worth hearing in this particular connection he is unable to point to the place where the ark was framed but suspects it was near the caucasus where grew goodly it was thought to have ﬂat bottom and crested roof and the wood gopher of which it was made was very probably cedar being light easy to cut sweet and the pitch he thinks was bitumen her length was six hundred feet the breadth one hundred feet and the depth sixty feet he calculates her internal capacity in cubical cubits four hundred and ﬁfty thousand which is sufﬁcient an hundred kind of beasts and their190 191 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https in the lower and second stories and two hundred and eighty fowls with noah and his family in the so far beam and length go she was considerably narrower than the ships in jansen s day which were commonly about three and half times long they were broad but what of her bows had she run had she the ﬂat bottom of barge or the moulded depth of the clipper but it matters not jansen s inspiration found copyists his fabric has ﬂoated solitarily down to us strange ship and now that we have viewed her she may brace round her yard again and proceed on her phantom course i not think however that we can ﬁnd much title in our own marine performances to justify laughter at the old folks ships is it conceivable that

the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https of rig i had been talking with an old seaman about the races between an english and an american yacht my companion was man who had spent the greater part of his life at sea and was sailor in the sense that includes not only smartness alertness and skill in those duties expected of seamen but thorough knowledge of all that concerns ships both in the fabrics of their hulls and in their masts yards rigging and canvas he said to that he was not sorry the yankee had beaten the englishman because it might cause yachtsmen to see that beam must still be regarded condition of speed and that the notion that swiftness was to be obtained by shape that answered to euclid s deﬁnition of line had been carried considerably too far one thing leading to another he spoke of schooner yachts and said that so far racing was concerned he fancied that the schooner rig was gradually sliding out of date and yet said he i m certain that if the prejudices of yachting skippers and yachting crews could be overcome and owners induced to see the thing in its right light the schooner yacht could be rendered faster craft than the most splashing and frothing of the yawls or cutters which now seem capable of sailing round them it was only the other day i was looking at yacht race there was middling breeze blowing i turned the glass upon schooner that was in the race she was ratching through it with spars almost erect whilst the yawls lay down till their rail looked to be under why was that would not you say because the schooner hadn t canvas enough she was showing all she had but she wanted more and if more had been given her she would have been leading instead of hanging in the wake of the toys that were swirling ahead of her what other canvas would i give her why of course i d give her and and topgallant yard consider what square sail would have done that schooner i ve been sailing in vessel of that rig when we ve taken the square off her and the moment that bit of canvas was clewed up you might have felt the way deadened in her if she d lost her if all impulse was gone the yachting skippers have got prejudice against square canvas it come s in my opinion in good many cases from the feeling that if they were shipmates with they wouldn t quite know what to with it i ve spoken to good many of them upon the subject and asked how it is that they don t recommend their gents to rig their vessels with square yards forward but their regular answer is pooh we don t want square sails who s going to be bothered with bracing yards about and mucking up aloft after shipshape bunts when gaffs and booms ll blow us along fast we need to go that s what it comes to who s going to be bothered skipper said to take vessel in stays you ve got your aback and instead of shooting ahead will she stops dead while she slowly comes that shows his ignorance i ve been ratching down the mersey in clipper schooner and such way did she get from her square canvas and such little notice did she take of her coming aback that i ve seen the skipper head her the shore with slow putting down of his helm to let her edge along and i ve watched her run good spell parallel with the shore before she came round on the other tack the increased way the square canvas gives schooner counterbalances whatever loss of way an aback sail is supposed to cause her my own opinion of the advantage of that canvas is such that i d undertake to ﬁt schooner yacht with square rig forward on these terms that i was allowed to sail her ﬁrst that if she beat i was to receive double pay my services and if she lost what i d done should be at my own expense and i d restore her to her old rig free only fancy in ratching the pulling power you d be giving to schooner your foreyard is suspended by truss and if you choose you could sweat it fore and aft if you230 231 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https there s nothing in square canvas to prevent schooner from lying up close if she was rigged naturally schooners ll go to leeward and be lost sight of racers if the canvas they compete under is out of all proportion with the canvas that yawls and cutters spread this is my notion anyway and such is my faith in my own opinion that i m willing to stand or fall by it on the terms i ve given you if so be any owner of schooner yacht is agreeable to give the i have comment to offer on this sailor s observations my knowledge of racing yachts their qualities and requirements does not carry nearly far enough to form any approach to judgment upon the use that might be made amongst competing schooners of square sails and square topsails i may say in the language of the old i served my time in the blackwall i went to sea at the age of thirteen and half in duncan dunbar s service and kept to the life until i was nearly two and twenty few sailors combine knowledge of with seamanship there is great difference between them there is between steam and sail my own part i must confess to knowing very little about yachts and yachting the point that struck most in this man s conversation was the vast amount of experience that must obviously be embodied in the innumerable rigs which are found aﬂoat in all parts of the world single sail will make all the difference between two vessels nay even the shape of sail will completely distinguish one craft from another the uniform of soldier distinguishes him from policeman think of the years of weather of violent seas of smooth waters lightly fanned of stron g head breezes and soft airs blowing over the stern which have entered into the creation of those hundred different types of square oblong pyramidal angular and the rest of it which pass and repass our shores here is an old sailor declaring that schooner yachts ought to be forward and he says that nearly all the yacht captains he has talked to upon this subject are opposed to his ideas one can perceive in this the difﬁculty there must have been in the beginning to settle the question of canvas question only to be dealt with by experience but an experience so varied and immense that it is impossible any man capable of rightly compassing the character of it not to ﬁnd something absolutely impressive in its way in every cloth that gleams upon the sea i remember once being in the of large hotel and hearing two men in the presence of several companions of theirs arguing about what billyboy was one man said it was kind of barge the other maintained that it was vessel similar to the old hoy much nonsense was talked yet the people sitting about them listened with attention emptied their glasses and looked though they thought that matter which of the disputants was one must be of them evidently knew very great deal about rigs at last an elderly man with velve t collar to his black cloth coat coming out of his chair in corner said i beg pardon intruding but i happen to know something about billyboys in fact i own couple what sort of billyboy you gentlemen mean is it or schooner or the company looked hard at him it was plain general misgiving to his seriousness seized them when he spoke of the sort of billyboy we are arguing about was the answer is just billyboy well said the other i told you gents i own two one s and t other s cutter the billyboy he added is round starned vessel with standing bowsprit and and mostly she s all that was his deﬁnition and it was accepted the man who ar gued that the billyboy was rigged like sloop looking particularly pleased now one would wish to know whether billyboy matter how many masts she carried would still be called billyboy if she had running instead of standing bowsprit this is one of those delicate points over which i will venture to say many hoarse argument has been roared out amidst clouds of tobacco smoke and the fumes of old book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https

consequence of numbers of this kind of craft trading to holland butter niceties in nomenclature may be found low down even the humble barge instance there is the barge vessel with mainsail that sets on is long pole if i may so describe it that stretches the outer head of the sail from the foot of the mast the mainsail of barge is brailed up when taken in and one must be careful that she has brails in talking to sailors about her otherwise one s ignorance will be greatly laughed at sometimes secretly and quite often openly the landsman must know that there is another species of barge called boomsail barge which is vessel with gaff and boom so here you have throat and peak halliards and brails are not required again there is the ge long vessel constructed on modern lines and rigged with standing bowsprit and jibboom gaff mainsail and gaff mizzen let these ﬁne distinctions be remembered in speaking of the barge to the bargee here already we see very nearly many types of barges

places getting cut down round corners generally with the destruction of one man the other man nearly always holding on to something and in many other ways constantly producing much small vexatiou s court litigation the dumb barge is very happily named and the term smells strongly of the bridge some of the terms given to certain descr iptions of rig mark degree of forecastl scorn and illustrate the power of marine irony an example take the jackass only the eye of mariner would distinguish any difference between vessel so termed and the fully rigged barque and what is the distinction jackass barque has fore and main topmasts and topgallant masts in one this is why i suppose sailors call her jackass perhaps the term mule would have been more correct and yet the polacre that outdoes the jackass barque in respect of spars is suffered to pass without derisive appellation here you have vessel with masts all in one to high the topmast crosstrees after which you come to separate

speaks of skysail poles of short royal mast heads of stump or short topgallant masts the vocabulary is apparently endless ﬁd is bar of wood or iron passed through the to support an upper mast ﬁdded topmast or topgallant mast is mast erected above its lower mast and supported by the ﬁd and yet one word means only one thing and every one is totally different from another single example when you speak of skysail poles you are talking of length of mast continued above the royal mast upon which skysail yard may be cross ed when you speak of stump topgallant masts you refer to mast that is neither royal mast nor skysail mast and upon which only can be set thus losing the two sails which the existence of the skysail pole admits of it is noteworthy that the only vessel to which mast more or less makes difference is is ship in the sailor s meaning of the word and not according to act of parliament here let say that the law deﬁnes ship to be any fabric that is not propelled by oars piece of absurdity forced upon general acceptance by its conveniency the proper deﬁnition of ship is vessel with three masts each mast being she would be ship even if she did not carry anything above her crosstrees she is made so by her crossjack and mizzen yard and mizzen top 74 yet if you add fourth mast to ship she is still ship even if it be what is termed spanker is mast rigged like the of barque ships are now common they seem comparatively recent but in reality they are old at least that noble american clipper the great republic that was aﬂoat some twenty or thirty years ago these fourth masts in ships are supposed to have been introduced on account of the length of the vessels but i have seen ships small any craft rigged with four masts they say that these concerns are handy in stays that proportionally they need fewer hands than ships and captains have told that they have watched them thrashing to windward in strong breeze with the power of an ocean passenger i should think this very likely if it were not that every vessel of this type which i have watched sailing or towing away outward bound has been so deep to look amidships if there was nothing but the thickness of her between her and the water 74 all the yards of ship says falconer in his marine dictionary are square except that of the in falconer s day the mizzen was set on lateen yard long since replaced by the gaff there was then crossjack yard to which the clews of the mizzen were sheeted home but crossjack was carried there was in the last century perhaps in the beginning of this vessel called bilander she was brig but with this peculiarity that her mainsail was set on lateen yard the tack was secured to in the middle of the vessel and the sheet to another in the taffrail many changes have been made in the rig of ships which have not altere d their character double topgallant yards leave ship ship though an alteration of this sort probably in another kind of vessel would cause sailors to invent new name her take example that most familiar craft the brig if the trysail of this vessel sets directly upon her mainmast then she is brig but if you afﬁx little mast abaft her mainmast and call it trysail mast and then set your trysail upon this mast the brig by this very triﬂing change becomes what is called snow landsman might be deﬁed to detect any difference between snow and brig and even when the distinction was pointed out to him he would scarcely understand what it consisted of nevertheless the addition or want of trysail mast create s two kinds of vessels rigged absolutely alike in all other respects and so far from the terms being interchangeable might be imagined of names applied to what looks to be the same thing the word snow is used in advertisements of sales by auction in order that it may be known the vessel offered is not238 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https brig and thus you may see in the shipping papers advertisements announcing that on thursday the snow aunt sally will be sold and perhaps under it on tuesday next the brig ann maria these are queer niceties and of very little use that i can see but sailors insist upon them and jack must be allowed to have his way take again the yawl and the dandy both vessels are cutter forward with aft upon which they set small sail to the inexperienced eye they are exactly alike what then is the difference it lies in the little sail that is set upon the yawl has the foot of which sets on spar that projects over the stern the dandy s mizzen has gaff and boom though the mizzens of some dandies i believe are what is termed the distinction is minute and yet the difference when looked into is found to be decided enough the yawl is chieﬂy the pleasure craft the dandy the ﬁshing vessel amongst ﬁshing craft the varieties of rigs are few they consist of the dandy the lugger and the smack the smack is vessel that is rigged like cutter and it is not necessary that vessel should be ﬁshing boat in order to be called smack to people who care about the sea there is much that is interesting in rigs the variations are curious illustrating experiments and the resolution to adopt certain forms useful in particular trades there is the barque vessel on her fore and main masts and with sails on her she is varied by the barquentine vessel rigged like brig or indeed like barque or ship on her foremast but with sails only on her main and 75 then out of the brig you get the snow and out of the snow the hermaphr odite brig which is vessel with brig s foremast and schooner s mainmast and out of the hermaphrodite brig comes the brigantine that unlike the hermaphrodite carries square at the main and unlike the brig has maintop in the same way there are different types of schooners such the schooner the schooner the schooner and the schooner differences of cut numbers of masts spread of sail give distinctions to the smallest and humblest class of boats thus tosher is not driver though both little vessels are employed in catching what they can close into the land the nomenclature of the sea has been so varied by successive generations that it is extremely difﬁcult to arrive at the paternity of sails to ascertain when such and such canvas was introduced and why the names it bore were given in some respects sir walter raleigh helps us in passage in his

service and that of her royal predecessors ﬁnd the following there are other sails called used almost on every stay the main topmast mizon and sometimes on the stay and topgallant stay and such sails are very useful if the ship goes anything from the wind that is when the sails are constantly full and not shivering there is another sail call d sail of good service to draw the ship forward but very prejudicial to the wear of the ship towards the close of the last century ships went so numerously clothed that it really seems though nothing but their prodigious beam enabled them to stand up to the press of canvas there were two jibs fore topmast and and fore here you have six sails the bowsprit and jibbooms royals were by this time used and were called the topgallant royals over the driver was

nine besides those carried at the fore ship with out on either side exposed less than sails the present century has added little to sails i can only think of the skysail but there have been great changes in shape formerly the mizzen was set on lateen yard were shaped like trysails the stay on which they were hoisted shaping them gaff does spanker long ago disappeared and the tendency of late years has been to diminish canvas insomuch that are longer common one needs good memory to bear even few distinctions in mind i remember once standing on the banks of the tyne and hearing man pointing to vessel like lighter call her wherry to my notions of course wherry was small open boat in which people are rowed by waterman or which they hire excursio ns close alongside this gigantic tyne wherry which by the way if my memory serves rightly was half full of coal lay similar craft that the same man spoke of keel i asked him why one should be called keel and the other wherry when they were both very much alike and i am under the impression though i can not be sure at this distance of time that he said the difference lay in one being carvel built that is with the outer planks coming together and forming perfectly smooth side and the other being clincher term applied to planks when they overlay one another be this it may it is at least certain that wherry in the north is different from wherry in the south and really when one comes to consider the inﬁnite variety of rigs and builds and the almost imperceptible subtleties amongst them which make the same name utterly inapplicable to what looks exactly like the same thing nautical gentlemen individuals who are not exactly sailors but who nevertheless know very great deal indeed about the sea insomuch that they are prepared to instruct at moment s notice the most ancient mariner they can come across in his people ought to be little more compassionate than they are usually found in dealing with those errors or oversights in marine technicality which landsmen are repeatedly guilty of and which writers and others who ought to know better are occasionally char geable book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https the old navigators managed it is extremely difﬁcult to understand how the old navigators contrived to convey their ships from port to port i not mean the ancients who are supposed to have kept the land aboard and to have steered by the stars though it is certain that they must again and again have been blown out to sea and yet made shift to get home again but those early voyagers who travelled to the indies by way of the cape and to the american seaboard they had conception of longitude they had means to determine it and their latitude was extremely vague an old chart or map is often strange sight the ﬁguration of continents and islands is little like the reality child s fanciful drawing of such things would be the longitude is mere guesswork and the heights or parallels are leagues out yet these old people managed to reach the places they started sometimes to be sure if the trip were long one they found themselves off the land at distance of hundred miles or so north or south it might be of their port but when you consider that even their knowledge of the variation of the compass was extremely the compass with them was sluggish primitive they could be sure of nothing but their and the north should be amazing to us who live in the age of the exquisite sextant the superb chronom eter sir william thompson s compass the patent revolving log and admiralty charts that mariners from the days of diaz columbus and magellan down to the period of maskelyne the nautical almanac and the establishment of

appendix to this voyage touching longitude written by the astronomer gellibrand the longitude of meridian he says is that which hath and still wearieth the greatest masters of geography he ridicules the notion that longitude may be ascertained by watching the variation of the needle though it is worth noting that this belief continued strong many years later may be gathered from passage in the introductory essay to churchill s navigantium atque itinerantium bibliotheca one thing more we shall observe before we quit this subject and it is this that the several methods ﬁnding the longitude before mentioned depend upon astronomical observations and those too very nice and exact which at sea it is very difﬁcult at any time and very often impracticable to make whence arises the necessity of ﬁnding out some other way of discovering the longitude which hitherto nothing has bid so fair perfect ﬁnding out the variation of the magnetic needle which being adjusted to table of longitudes they would then reciprocally show each other gellibrand regards eclipses more especially of the whose leisure however he adds we must often wait and perhaps go without if the heavens be not propitious to us the most satisfactory means of determining the longitude but at sea people want someth ing more prompt than an eclipse to ﬁnd out where they are generations then the mariner was left to depend upon his which one method of navigating ship is still in force and i not know that we have in any way altered this old practice of computing save by the introduction of the patent log whose indications are still in some directions checked by the of our forefathers simply consists of ascertaining how fast the ship sails by heaving the log by entering the courses sailed by allowing leeway the ship let us say steered one hour by north during the following hour the third hour and then during the fourth hour came up to again in those four hours her rate varied at one clock the log showed her sailing at seven knots at two knots at three knots at four six knots and her leeway was sometimes of point sometimes one point sometimes more her place then on the chart may be easily set down or pricked out of these entries in the in thick weather there is other way of computing ship s progress and position the sky may be obscured days and all that man can is to heave his log watch how the ship heads and observe her leeway it was in this fashion that the ancient mariner contrived to crawl about the ocean and it is worth observing that the log he measured his way with we still possess and use ship i should think goes to sea without the reel the line and the glass the rotating logs tell you how far you have gone in given time with tolerable accuracy but the is the only appliance that i am acquainted with which will tell you how fast you are going at the moment seamen have told that with their eye they can tell the speed of their ship more accurately than with the i not believe this and on testing these cocksure men i have never once found them right within half knot of course this refers to sailing ships steamer goes along steadily and it is quite conceivable that person accustomed to steamships could tell correctly the speed of one by looking over the side but sailing vessel varies her rate with every puff under certain conditions the increased sail that seems to be thrashing her through it with greater velocity has diminished her speed i particularly recollect an instance dynamometer was attached to the taffrail of large ship to it was afﬁxed line which it dragged through the water the pull of the line was equivalent to weight of sixty pounds the vessel was then sailing with the wind point before the beam under all plain sail the breeze fresh the foretopmast was set and the hand of the dynamometer went back showing that the speed had been decreased to the extent illustrated by this diminution of weight in the pull of the line by the setting of the the chief ofﬁcer however was so certain that the ship had improved her speed despite the unmistakable indication s of the dynamometer that to prove his judgment he ordered the log to be hove with the result246 247 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https the speed was less by knot i think than it had been before the was set the fact is the ship had sail enough the additional canvas simply buried and so retarded her yet this same mate was one of many seamen who had assured that they could tell the speed of vessel better with the eye than with the log it is true nevertheless that the mariners of certain nations in former times chose the eye in preference to the knotted line the dutch in particular though they always took the reel and glass to sea with them seldom used them there looks to have been something of laziness in their habit an account of the hollander s slatternly trick of navigation may be found in note to voyages to the east indies by the late john splinter stavorinus in and 75 this author tells us that the dutchmen of his own and of earlier times steered by the true compass or rather endeavoured to so by means of small central movable card which they set to the meridian and whenever they discover the variation has altered degrees since the last adjustm ent they again correct the central card this is steering within quarter of point without aiming at greater there was the same guesswork in their they hove log says stavorinus the ofﬁcer of the watch corrected the course leeway by his own judgment before marking it down on the logboard they computed their speed by measuring distance of forty feet along the ship s side they take notice of any remarkable patch of froth when it is abreast of the foremost end of the measured distance and count till the mark of froth is abreast of the after end with the number of thus obtained they divide the number taking the product the rate of sailing in geographical miles in one hour or the number of dutch miles in four one ﬁnds the same phlegmatic indifference in their manner of taking sights it is not usual to make any allowance in the sun s declination on account of being on different meridian from that which the tables are calculated they in general compute the numbers just they are found in the tables from all this drily adds stavorinus it is not difﬁcult to conceive the reason why the dutch are frequently above ten degrees out in their the spaniards and the portuguese were more wary if not more knowing than the dutch extreme vigilance in conning ship was apparently feature of the navigation of those old and famous races of mariners sir richard hawkins purchas vol iv is express in this i will let him deliver himself in his own quaint inimitable tongue in this point of steeridge steering the spaniards and portugalls exceede all that i have seene i meane their care which is chiefest in navigation and i wish in this and in all their workes of discipline and reformation we should follow their examples also those of any other nation in every shippe of moment upon the or quarter they have chaire or seate out of which whilst they navigate the pilot or his adjutants which are the same ofﬁcers which in our shippes we term the master and his mates never depart day nor night from the sight of the compasse and have another before them whereby they see what they doe and are ever witnesses of the good or bad steeridge of all men that take the later generation of sailors portugalls well others knew better than to suffer men on the whether ofﬁcers of the watch or quarter masters to be seated the common contrivance taking the height of the sun at sea in order to obtain the latitude was the f or it was composed of wooden staff upon which was marked scale of degrees and parts of degrees it was also ﬁtted with crosspieces sliding along it at their middle parts the smallest crosspieces were used observing the least altitudes the observation of the sun s height was taken by means of the shadow which the extremity of the crosspiece cast on the staff when the instrument was adjusted contrast this humble uncouth engine with the sextant of the f was another implement the invention of davis the arctic explorer by the help of which the ancient mariner made his way about the ocean he had also the astrolabe clarke in his progress

accepted the one employed by the mariners of his own and of much later periods one special article in his treatise is entitled by the poet another conclusion to prove the latitude of region that ye ben in and the whole passage is so quaint and interesting withal that every nautical reader of this volume will i am sure thank transcribing it i quote from the edition of the treatise published by brae in 1870 if writes chaucer thou desire to know this latitude of the region take the altitude of the sonne in the myddle of the daye when the sonne is in the hed of aries or of libra than movethe the sonne in the lyne equinoctial and abate the nombre of that same sonne s altitude out of 90 degrees and than is the remnaunt of the nombre that leveth the altitude of the region suppose that the

certain minutes lesse nowe if it so be that thou thinketh too long tarrying to abyde til that the sonne be in the hed of aries or libra than waite when that the sonne is in any other degree of the zodiake and consider if the degree of his declinacion be northward from the equinoctial abate than from the sonne s altytude at none the nombre of his declinacion and than hast thou the height of the hedes of aries and libra sonne peraventure is in the 10 degree of leo almost 56 degrees of height at none and his declinacion is almost 18 degrees northward from the equinoctial abate than thilke 18 degrees of declinacion out of the altitude at none than leveth 38 there the height of the hed of aries or libra and thyn equinoctial in that so then all the ancient mariner had to was to take the height of the sun subtract or add the declination and accept the remainder his latitude an easy process that gives us cape horn on the parallel and valdivia on the 76 and yet they managed excellently

examinations certiﬁcates of competency obligation to ﬁnd the time by equal altitudes or the longitude by chronometer or by lunar observations the whole art of the navigation of our ancestors is summed up in the account of voyage sent by thomas steevens to his father in 1579 in which he tells him that it is hard to sail from east to west or contrary because there is ﬁxed point in all the sky whereby to direct course i shall tell you says he what helps god provideth these and he informs his father that not fowle appears nor sign in the air or in the sea which has not been written about by those who make the is to the east indies wherefore partly by their own experience and pondering withal what space the ship was able to make with such winde and such direction and partly by the experience of others whose books and navigations they have they gesse whereabouts they 77 that is according to one or two old maps i have seen i have elsewhere quoted this and other passages many of these papers were written at long intervals and i could not charge my memory with references already made use of and accurately enough they gessed too but then there was dispatch every owner of bottom took his own

that he candidly owned himself but very little obliged to maskelyne and the admiralty so long afterwards 1794 i ﬁnd william hutchinson mariner in very admirable and voluminous treatise on naval architecture writing in deﬁant terms touching the nautical the board of longitude he says in order to facilitate the discovery that is expected to be made by this method namely the nautical almanac has ordered that the masters the royal navy must qualify themselves by learning to pass an examination to show that they understand the nautical almanac which is task in my opinion that can not be expected from many of our most hardy and expert navigators whose education has been mostly from early youth through the hard laborious busy scenes of life at sea and who have never had the opportunity to get the learning that is necessary to understand the true principles of this possibly even in this day it might not be hard to ﬁnd sea veterans who would secretly agree with hutchinson s protest

government ﬁx it him and if so where is the carrying power of vessel to be calculated by her surplus buoyancy or is her clear side to be taken in relation to her depth of hold is it possible to ﬁx one loading point all vessels whether they be decked ships or ships or ships all these are scientiﬁc conundrums which will have to be solved sooner or later they are certainly of the gravest possible moment to the shipping interests the law now stands shipowner is permitted to determine at what height on the vessel s side loadline shall be ﬁxed but if in the opinion of the ofﬁcials the loadmark does not furnish sufﬁcient freeboard the ship can be stopped and forced to dischar ge much of her cargo shall raise her to the height the ofﬁcials may consider she requires the injustice of this is tolerably obvious practically the board of trade have their preconceived theory of the proper freeboard of every vessel they or their representativ es say yonder is vessel of three thousand tons she needs so many feet of clear side her owners in our opinion are overloa ding her but let them proceed when she is full her stores crew and passengers aboard and everything ready the voyage we will stop her and force her to disgor now if the board of trade can decide after why can they not decide before why should shipowners be obliged to guess at the theories of freeboard which the board have in their mind and be visited with the penalty of costly delay if their conjectures should be wrong the government authorities say we will not ﬁx the loadline you must that at your own risk but practically they ﬁx the loadline by empowering their representatives to stop ships which look to be overloaded surely it would be more consistent with common sense and common justice to determine loadlin the shipowner before he ﬁlls up his ship than to keep the determination carefully concealed from him until his vessel is about to start or actually has commenced her voyage this then i have said is the great shipping question of the times and it is the outcome of the wise and humane consideration how to diminish the perils of the deep those who have to seek living upon it it is to be hoped that the numerous scientiﬁc controversies which have grown out of the subject of the loadline may not overcloud and conceal the object the plimsoll disc was intended to effect that object was to prevent owners from sending human lives to sea aboard ships so deeply freighted that the ﬁrst heavy gale of wind was bound to sink them unhappily departmental timidity has gone very near to neutralizing great and beneﬁcent measure without satisfying the class who were to be appeased and quieted many overladen ships contrive somehow to sneak off to sea unnoticed by those functionaries whose duty it is to stop such vessels if they founder with all hands the law considers itself sufﬁciently avenged by mulcting the owners and imprisoning them unfortunately this does not save the

points to signify his or take from late deposition the narrative of shipmaster who relates that he proceeded the wind was so and so such and such light bore the land was three miles distant the sea smooth and the vessel steaming full speed on sudden it was noticed that the ship was down by the head the engineer sounded the forehold and found nearly four feet of water in it then all hands were called on deck and the steam pumps set to work but the water gained on the pumps and meanwhile the vessel steadily continued to settle down by the head the fore hatches were removed and nearly six feet of water found the pumps continued working and the crew baled with might and main with buckets but all was of good so deponent got the boats ready use he tried to drive his ship shorewards but she would not answer her helm on which he stopped the engines and lowered the boats they were picked up by another vessel and shortly after they were aboard the ship they had quitted went down head foremost this occurred close to the land where there was plenty of help and so we get the poor shipmaster s deposition but it might have occurred leagues out at sea where there was succour and then the ship would have been missing nothing heard of the crew and the formal marine inquiry would have wound up with another handful of dots and what caused that steamer to go down head foremost on ﬁne

strongly in my head the other day when i happened to ﬁnd myself standing under the bends of the towering iron skeleton of ship that when completed would be 100 1 and qualiﬁed to carry three thousand tons of merchandize the hammering all about was sharp and furious the sparks ﬂew wildly and the rivets popped out of the holes they were cut and hammered by the men though they were carrots there were other ships on line with this one completely plated and painted another third mere outline of frames and keelson and and the scene was an imposing one and especially impo sing was the appearance of the completed ship with the polish of her clean metal run and the gilt tracings about her ﬁgurehead and quart ers and yet when i turned my eyes from her to the skeleton under which i was standing i

put my little ﬁnger oh the rivets ll draw that into its place said the man true i exclaimed but you wouldn t call it ﬁt he answered i wouldn t call it ﬁt but the rivets ll make it but don t you see said i that by prizing these plates together with the rivets you are putting work on the rivets which they are not designed if the blow of sea springs the rivets the plates must yawn at this rate it seems to that the rivets not only keep the plates together but actually give the hull its what are ye sir said he to surveyor my man i replied if i were i should be talking to your master not to you here s another point that strikes worth noticing look at these they re259 260 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https punched i certainly they re punched he answered but don t you think they ought to be drilled i asked punching is bound to weaken the by cracking and dislocating the ﬁbres of the metal around them and rendering them the less ﬁt hold the drilling ud be much better of course said the man but it ud pretty nigh double the expense and that ud be going the wrong way to what the shipowners but here again i see another curious feature said i look through these one after another many you choose there s not single hole in the front plates that corresponds with the holes in the plates at the back how on earth are you going to drive rivet through such hole that instance said i pointing to hole so much lower than the hole behind it that the apertures where the two plates met resembled moon oh we ll rivet somehow he answered laughing and without even glancing at the holes to which i sought to direct his attention at this juncture somebody who might have been the manager came snifﬁng curiously about the man went on with his work and i moved off before quitting the yard however i walked over to the other incomplete ones i had look at them here i found precisely the same kind of workmanship and frames full of cracks and ﬂaws the roughly punched and not single hole corresponding with the holes behind the landings yawning and waiting to be prized and warped and severely strained into their places by the rivets i am not writing learnedly i am avoiding all technicalit ies i wish the public who know nothing about marine terms to understa nd neither i assert that this shipbuilding yard which i inspected is typical one but this much i will say and man who has some small knowledge of the power and fury of the sea in time of were i and had to choose between one of these 1 iron steamships of from two thousand to three thousand tons gross and one of the old coasters which have long since been condemned and rendere d impossible i should be perfectly content to let the toss of coin decide satisﬁed that so far security at sea goes there would be just much promise of my speedy dissolution aboard such steamer aboard the old cofﬁn it is not hard to understand what reproach this kind of vessel is to us maritime nation and how it has come about the same ﬁerce competition that covers our tables with butter made of fat and coffee made out of old beans is covering the ocean with the sort of ships i am writing of the problem is now how to build the cheapest steamer to carry maximum cargo on minimum draught of water and to pass the surveyors ﬁt to go to sea the shipbuilders are not to blame they will good work good money but if good money be not forthcoming though some kind of work be expected then they will give you frames which are only ﬁt to sell old iron the workmanship will be mere clagging the plates will be wrenched and warped into any kind of abominable ﬁt by the rivets the whole structure and the lives of the people who commit themselves to it will be made to depend upon points which honest shipwright would dream of reckoning factors in the binding and holding powers of the fabric and the false and frail contrivance doctored up and smothered over with paint will be launched with all haste and the next order proceeded with at once therefore in so far the loadline is designed the protection of the sailor against the rapacity of those owners who would load their vessels down to their waterways if they could only manage to make them ﬂoat at that there must always be most unpleasant quality of insufﬁciency in the controversies the subject has excited so long they exclude consideration of the kind of vessels which are launched month after month and year after year from many shipbuilding yards the absurdity of painting or nailing a262 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https disc upon the side of vessel which is to strong ship what cheap suburban villa built with walls is to house in grosvenor or square struck forcibly i stood the other day looking at the ﬂimsy metal skeletons which when plated with thin sheets of iron and loaded with the dead weight of coal and freight and engines are to confront and give battle to the terrible sea i shall be asked if protection is afforded the sailor against the deadly risks such shipbuildin g this involves by those marine surveyors whose duties inspectors are very clearly and precisely laid down them by the authorities they represent i answer let those interested in the subject make tour of inspection in quietly i did into those shipbuilding yards where cheap steamers are manufactured and judge with their own eyes to what extent i am inaccurate in afﬁrming that proportion of the ships which are built in this country are renewing with tenfold disgrace those maritime crimes which were supposed to have been ground out of our civilization and reviving with tenfold horror those peculiar forms of marine disasters which were hopefully assumed to have been shelved along with the old wooden craft and now let say here few words on the subject of marine surveying if there be one class of responsible men more than another who should be wholly above suspicion who should be possessed of moral courage equal under all circumstances to the unbending and unfaltering dischar ge of the duties accepted by them they should consist one would think of the men employed by lloyd s and the board of trade to inspect the construction of ships and to pronounce upon their ﬁtness fabrics you have only to consider what is involved in the duties of marine surveyors to appreciate the high and extraordinary character of their obligations upon their capacity to distinguish between good and bad work and upon their courage judges to whom their employers entrust the exercise of the widest possible discretion practically depends the life of every human being who goes to sea sailor or passenger of course the difﬁculties of the vocation humanly speaking are not hard to understand we may appreciate the embarrassment surveyor labours under in having to condemn the work of shipbuilder with whom he is on very friendly terms to say more the temptation to inspect any other part of the fabric than that which imperatively calls condemnation must under certain circumstances be very great but let all this be freely admitted life is more precious than class sensibilities and if an evil is to ﬂourish only on the condition that nothing is said about it most of us will agree that it is high time to cultivate candour in that direction at least i have hesitation in saying that large proportion of the marine surveying of the day is one of the most glaring it certainly is the cruellest of the shams of the period samples of work are passed which were there the least sincerity and conscience in the minds of those who decide upon them could under possibility have left the yards in which they were produced men women and children are sent to sea in structures which never would have been permitted to quit the only place they are safe mean the dry the surveyors put any shadow of honesty into the duties they are appointed to dischar ge look said gentleman to the other day in shipbuilding yard look at that faulty work there is it possible that mr naming the surveyor means to pass it the surveyor stood at distance the gentleman called him and pointed out the defective work the surveyor seemed surprised and shook his head ah said he that is too bad i shan t be able to pass but he did pass it the gentleman some days after wrote to tell that the faulty points had not been remedied and that the ship was to be launched just she was what cries an american writer in yankee shipping journal what of the ismailia bernina bayar d homer stamfor dham telford zanzibar toxfor d sylvia surbiton

own tongue from across the seas far less need of hospitals did they use us well were this forecastle of ours ﬁt wherein to dwell ships are cofﬁns nowadays life is but toy jerry murders millions board of trade ahoy sings the contemporary sailor but there is very little use in his shouting ahoy if the only response he gets is the appointment of men who ﬁlling ofﬁces designed his protection deliberately ignore their most grave and great responsibilities and lure him by what are absolutely false representations into committing his life to unseawor thy ships unhappily in marine topics public interest is only to be awaked by reiteration but let it be remembered that it is not only jack s life that is jeopardized by our new shipbuilding departures the subject is one that concerns every living being that crosses the ocean or who has friends at sea the sailor we know is an abstraction nautical we are people we barely take count of him unless stage show or the jack pudding of romance but when we think of passengers we think of our friends and of ourselves is the loss of the clan macduff still within living memory everybody was much shocked at the time by that dreadful wreck but people would have been more shocked had they taken the trouble to master the meaning of the wreck commissioner s ﬁnding when by absolving the owner from all responsibility on the grounds that the vessel had been passed by board of trade surveyor he practically decided that the board of trade through the ofﬁcial who certiﬁcated the clan macduff was answerable the dreadful disaster that befel her at this rate what assurance have the travelling public leaving sailors out of the question that their lives are in any degree cared apparently the board of trade are not to be reached if one of their servants passes ship which goes to pieces an crazy machine in the ﬁrst gale of wind she encounters whilst the owner of the becomes an irresponsible being on the merits of certiﬁcate cunningly courted and fraudulently given if the wreck commissioner s law be sound then the criminality of certiﬁcating unseaworth y ships is intensiﬁed by the fact that it secures the owners against all penalties of course both the board of trade and lloyd s act with perfect sincerity they appoint the best men they can get the triﬂing wages they give to certain work and it is not their fault that some of these men should prove unfaithful but since nothing can be more certain than that the whole system of marine surveyorship we have it is deceptive blundering and in high degree obnoxious to human life and property is it not about time that we set to work to invent some better method guaranteeing so far shipbuilding workmanship and material go the lives and property of the hundreds and thousands of people who go to sea sailors and passengers society nor government department has right to subject men invested with powers made solemn by their involvement of precious life to the

dishonouring to the highest and most opulent and fertile branch of british industry and as266 267 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https species of legalized and truly rank conspiracy against the lives of passengers and sailors i have brieﬂy referred to the case of the clan macduff it will serve my purpose to give more particular instance of marine surveying i found it reported at length in one of the shipping journals the brig scio was wooden vessel built in 1839 and she was still aﬂoat in she was the property of blumer bushell of south shields who had purchased her probably quite much she was worth she was docked and repaired at cost of her ﬁrst start after leaving the doctor s hands was unfortunate she went ashore at kunda and damaged her keel this was repaired being spent upon her next voyage she went to sea with crew of eight hands and load of four hundred and tons of coal her registered tonnage being triﬂe over two hundred and scarcely was she at sea when she was found to be making water the master s attention was engrossed by the job of pumping in the midst of which the wind breezed up hard the vessel fell off the mainboom jibed and broke in halves one piece of which falling upon boy struck him down dead the leak increased and the crew compelled the master to run leith roads here the vessel was placed on the mud and caulked high nine feet of water around her would let the irons go thus soldered she started once more and plumped on to inchkeith she was towed off after dischar ging ﬁfteen tons of cargo and was docked with four hundred and fourteen tons of coal in her bottom portion of her crew now refused to share any more of her fortunes so they were dischar ged and others shipped in their room once more this noble brig proceeded but had not put ﬁfteen miles betwixt her and the land when the crew came aft in body swore that the water was coming in fast and must presently drown the ship and begged the master to put back this he did in the face of strong head wind which obliged him to beat up the firth of forth in short tacks squall came along and blew the lower out of the soon afterwards the scio struck on some sands off buckhaven but managed to beat over them the master said he now wanted to haul his brig off the land but that the men refused to turn to the crew denied this but let the truth be what it would not long after the vessel had beaten over the sands she went ashore somewhere north of kirkcaldy on which the crew very sensibly got out such is the picturesque history of brig which man will believe could by any possibility have been found aﬂoat in these days of the stringent merchant shipping act and of surveyors appointed by the board of trade to stop rotten vessels from proceeding to sea it was declared at the good deal of litigation was generated by this dismal old two shipwright surveyors who were ofﬁcers of the board of trade inspected the vessel whilst under repairs visiting her several times and pointing out what should be done yet you will have observed that the scio never quitted the dock without all hands going to the pumps only to knock off in order to come aft and request the skipper to put back to save their lives and if this most unimpeachable testimony to the value of board of trade surveying was not of sufﬁcient weight there comes turner into court with samples of the timbers and planks of the wreck which he had inspected on the beach and this gentleman deliberately to the samples he from the survey he made of the wretched old hooker s remains she was unseaworthy there is arrogance in pretending to wisdom after the event has happened the surveyors might afﬁrm what they chose but we having the end of the story under our eyes are at full liberty to say that declarations that the brig was seaworthy can make her seaworthy in the face of the water that ran into her bottom and that kept the crew pumping and hurrying back to land to save their lives theories are excellent things in the absence of facts but when fact comes in the road the biggest theory must make way the pumping and the putting back are the most satirical commentaries which can be imagined on the declarations of the board of trade surveyors what is their notion of seaworthiness is it pumping morning noon and night and all hands imploring the269 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https to put his helm up and try back if it be not that if on the contrary they deﬁne seaworthiness to consist of tight craft how are they going to reconcile the results of their survey of the brig scio with the results of her attempted voyages i quote this example of surveying because it is illustrative of the worthlessness of the supervision practised by the board of trade under the present system of protecting life and property and because it is typical of much of the work that is done in that way by the men who are paid to look after the interests they represent the justices who sat at of the ﬁrst investigation absolved the owner on the grounds that he did all that he could to render his brig is to say taking into consideration the precautions taken by the owner under the surveillance of the board of trade surveyors at shields and at leith and having all the work executed by practical men of long standing the court could come to other conclusion than that set forth in the but what said the assessors the nautical element in this investigation we not concur in this judgment and will furnish our own that report is the only endurable supplement to the justices annex that could be devised the writers declare that the brig was not properly and efﬁcie ntly repaired and that she was not in good and seaworthy condition when she left leith that in their opinion the scio was in all probability in worse state when she left leith on november 26th than when she left the tyne on the they deny that the owner used all those reasonable means in opening the scio out and ascertaining her exact condition which practical man he should have known vessel of her age require d and which he had such ample and available means of doing in his own dock thereb y neglecting to ensure her being sent to sea in seaworthy the whole story bears out this decision and the assessors judgment being unquestionably correct what are we to think of the surveyors who could allow the brig to go to sea leaking like sieve and then come into court and speak well of the vessel on the grounds that they had superintended the repairing of her and had even pointed out what should be done in this case happily lives were lost the brig went ashore and her people left her but suppose she had gone down and drowned her crew out of hand would not the board of trade in the person of their representative have been morally guilty of the death of the men assure dly they accepted the responsibility of that brig being in ﬁt condition to go to sea they accept the responsibility of every vessel which their representatives pass being seaworthy this consideration ought surely to give signiﬁcance to the system of supervis ion they now practise and to make them ask themselves whether having regard to the weight and solemnity of their obligations they have any right servants of the public to persist in multiplying the perils of the deep by sham and hollow method of inspection there is not shipmaster in the country who is not sensible of the necessity of speedy reform in this matter and there is not passenger who would not eagerly join in the cry reformation were even but very

distance they are not at all unlike in truth the horizon of these seas really offers nothing more gaunt primitive and cumbersome than the french lugger smack with her immensely round bows great spring

forecastle talking at once and dropping their various jobs of sweeping repairing nets stringing ﬁsh and the like to gesticulate where all these people sleep how they manage to stow themselves away i once counted men women and boys aboard french smack that certainly did not exceed ﬁve and twenty tons three or four of whom probably might be have been thought many hands that smack wanted had she been an english vessel and yet numerous those french men and women the ladies lent hand pulling and hauling with the worked their ship so slowly and laboriously and made so much noise that any one would have supposed she was under and all hands abusing the skipper putting to sea without proper complement the wind was an inshore breeze and they had to beat out of harbour it was enough to make one split one s sides to see the fellows tumbling and ﬂoundering over one another whenever the helm was put down every man seemed skipper bawled out orders in lingo compared to which the accents of newcastle pitman excited by whisky would be considered chaste music and i looked to see half of them in their frantic hurry topple overboard it so happened that at the particular moment when the frenchman had rounded on the starboard tack the purpose of making another board so to fetch the open water large passenger steamer was entering the harbour at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour the men on the pier roared to the french smack to get out of the road yash yash answered the old fellow at the tiller waving his hand but he never shifted his helm either not understanding what was said or else supposing that the steamer would go clear of him what followed happened in breath the steamer could not stop her way though her engines were by this time reversed and the wheels sending whole surface of foam sluicing towards her bows her sharp stem took the frenchman right amidships there was crash of splintered wood and the vessels immediately going clear i saw that the unfortunate smack was cut down to the water s edge and her people i live to write it all hands were overboard they had men women and the rail when they saw that the steamer was bound to come and the foaming eddies thrown along by the racing reversed wheels of the steamboat were full of revolving red caps and earrings and white handkerchiefs it was wonderful to see them all in the water supporting themselves with the utmost ease half of them breast high waiting until they should cease to rotate that they might ﬁx their vessel and observe whether she meant to ﬂoat or sink before any boat could put off to them they had made up their minds and were swimming towards the smack over whose sides they clambered until her decks were once more ﬁlled with them and there they273 274 book the hammock

common objects in some of our english harbours but familiar they are there is deal of amusement to be obtained by standing and looking down on their decks if they hailed from country ten thousand miles distant the manners appearance customs of the crews could not be more totally different from those of our own smacksmen it makes one think of the spaniards at trafalgar hanging big wooden

that she seems full of business if it is summer time ﬁve or six brawny lads are taking the diversion of bath over the side while the ladies of the extensive company go quietly on with their mending of nets or stockings the men smoke argue grease their boots peel potatoes clean ﬁsh and the gruff murmur of wild patois ﬂoats up amid which the most accomplished french scholar can only now and again

him to wind round drunk monotonous and melodious davits at which he may cat his anchor did his forefathers forecastles clammy the most reeking of the holes in which the jacks of other days lay snoring with purple faces in clouds of cockroaches but all that it will not to pretend that the sailor is what he was i not speak of the caricatures of the ﬁctionist the monstrous ﬁgures with lanthorn jaws broken teeth wooden legs and bloodsh ot eyes the race of hatchways trunnions and pipses who stagger full of drink and oaths in clamorous procession through the pages of the sea novelists losing to be sure something of their inexpressible garnishing s they enter the truer oceanic atmosphere of the coopers and the marryats of the present century i refer simply to the old sailor to the plain and merchantman of bygone years not to the frankenstein in ﬂowing breeches and hat on nine hairs who trod the stage and procured his circulation in one two and three volumes in the respectable name of jack prior even to the days when sir launcelot greaves found the irresponsible anatomy willing to ship the broad habergeon vant brace and greves and let be understood the british or american mariner of is hearty nimble dexterous determined fellow ever he was at any time during the choicest and most glorious period of his nation s history he needs but opportunity to test him it is in his traditions habits superstitions that he differs from his predecessors i not think it is the iron of his latter calling that has entered his soul and changed him the very distinguishable difference is owing to natural decay of marine sentiment he is longer because he is not without tincture of educat ion hard wear has attenuated his prejudices and custom has lost its hold upon him it would be difﬁcult now i should think to ﬁnd in any forecastle such superstitious the old salt who in dana s two years before the mast agreed with the black cook to the malignant and wizard qualities of the finns familiarity with the grand liquid amphitheatre into which he descends and toils his bread may have helped to rob the modern sailor of what i must call the romantic features of the seaman s nature in olden times the voyage was long the art of navigation crude and halting the wonders of the deep were many at least they were found so man passed so long while at sea that he was saturated with the spirit of it supe rstitions salt the billow from which they were wrought begot peculiar forms of thoug ht customs grew out of the strange fancies and284 285 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https and that they should now be dead means simply that they ﬂourished centuries and that they died very hard at last how wide the difference is between the shipboard life of the mariners of the past and that of the present race of seamen may be collected by looking into few of the customs which are now extinct the timbers of noah s ark in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was practice on board italian and spanish and possibly portuguese ships the sailors on crossing the equator to erect canopy on the forecastle under which three seamen absurdly dressed seated themselves one was called the president the others judges they started ﬁrst with trying the captain then the ofﬁcers ﬁnally the passengers sailor dressed up clerk read the indictments after which the judges pronounced sentence of death careri in his voyage round the world explains the purpose of this tomfoolery the sentence of death says he was immediately bought off with money chocolate sugar biscuit ﬂesh sweetmeats wine and the like the best of it was that he who did not pay imme diately or give good security was laid on with rope s end at the least sign given by the president apparently heavier punishments than rope attended the poverty or contumacy of the convicted the same author tells of passenger who was drowned on board galleon throu gh being refusing to conform to this singular marine custom the if sport it can be all day and then at sundown the ﬁnes or forfeits were divided among the sailors it is possible that out of this old rose the stupid and irritating practice of ducking men on their crossing the equator the ﬁrst time this imbecile piece of play was wonderfully popular among seamen down to quite recent days i don t think jack ever saw much humour himself in the mere dressing up neptune and acting jack pudding in the waist what he relished was the privilege by prescription of lording it over the captain and ofﬁcers few hours and tarring and soaking people to whom at other times he would have to pull his forelock with the whole length of the ship between him and their nobility another curious custom was to be found on board dutch vessels when ship entered the 39th parallel every one writes john nieuhof f 1640 of what quality or degree soever that has not passed there before is obliged to be baptized or redeem himself from it he that is to be baptized has rope tied round his middle wherewith he is drawn up to the very top of the bowsprit and from thence three times successively tumbled into the water man was at liberty to get another to take his place by paying him plenty of money and other good things must have been earned by sailors out of this custom one may conceive that nervous passenger would pay handsomely to escape so formidable ducking the tall bowsprits of those days promised whilst on the other hand seasoned mariner would look upon such sousings mere child s more of it than man in regatta now thinks of walking out upon greasy boom to loose the pig in the sack at the end of it the practice however eventually led to such riots broils and bloodshed that it was forbidden by the dutch government it was long continued however in the british navy punishment in the annual register 1797 there is an account of four naval ofﬁcers who were soused by mutinous crew on board his britannic majesty s ship sandwich the writer calls it curious ceremony the unhappy naval ofﬁcers must have thought it so they tie the unfortunate victim s feet together and their hands together and put their bed at their back making it fast round them at the same time adding an to bring them down they afterwards made them fast to tackle suspended from the arm and hoisting them nearly up to the block all at once let go and drop them souse into the sea where they remain minute and then are again hoisted and let down alternately till there are scarce any signs of life when the miserable victims are ducked to the fancy of their are triced up by the heels that the287 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https may run out of them and then stowed away in their hammocks this kindness was denied to the four naval ofﬁcers who after having hung head down some time were tumbled into boat and sent ashore the portuguese had custom of their own on crossing the line it was curiously tinctured with the superstitions of that age those on board who had never cut the equator were compelled to give the sailors money or provisions or wine one was excused not even the capuchins says the missionary angelo of gattina writing in 1666 of whom they take beads agnus deis or things which being exposed to sale what they yield is given to say masses the souls in purgatory if any one declined to give he was carried before forecastle tribunal by sailors habited ofﬁcers seaman dressed judge in long gown passed sentence and the victim was straightway hoisted to the and ducked this custom was not conﬁned to the equator the same says angelo is practised in passing the straits of gibraltar and the cape of good the italian fashion was somewhat similar sailors apparelled judges sat at table and those who had never before crossed the line were brought before them the judges reproached them contemptuously daring to live so long in the world without passing the equator and ﬁned them according to their condition ducking followed refusal to pay merolla in his voyage to congo 1682 says from this punishment or ﬁne none are exempt and it is said that with the latter they maintain livelier and certainly less cruel custom i ﬁnd in spanish ships in the form of this was contrived by man dressing himself up so to resemble bull he took care to equip himself with an ugly pair of horns another fellow mounted upon two men attacked the bull with spear the humour lay in the two men who formed the horse being tied back to back with saddle between them on which sat the rider the bull it may be supposed usually had the best of it i am reminded here of stroke of original humour on the part of some midshipmen it is illustrative of the reefer s theory of wit they got some hencoops and formed them into cockpit and making circle by coiling ropes they pitted couple of cocks the cocks did their best to ﬁght but they staggered so oddly that they could scarce strike each other it was at last admitted that they had been fed with barley soaked in rum the midshipmen supposed that the spirit would fortify the hearts of the birds but they had over them and the creatures were too drunk to ﬁght drinking is sea custom not yet at least if it is dead the fault is not jack but even though the economical principles of owners had suffered perpetuation of the practice on shipboard i question whethe r the most bibulous of the present race of sailors could carry it to the height to which it was formerly raised i suppose the very biggest drink on record is that related by dampi er he says that there came on board his ship one captain rawlins the commander of small new england vessel along with john hooker they were asked into the cabin to drink and bowl was made containing six quarts mr hooker being drunk to by captain rawlins who pledged captain hudswell and having the bowl in his hand said that he was under an oath to drink but three draughts of strong liquor day and putting the bowl to his head turned it off at one draught and so making himself drunk disappointed us of our expectations till we made another six quarts at draught twelve pints at swallow without sigh between but then hard drinking was the custom not of the privateers only but of the whole seafaring races of early times they were educated to it by liberal doses of grog the allowance sometimes rose to pint of rum per man day in the french spanish and portuguese ships and very often in the dutch the sailors courage before an action was nearly invariably helped with jacks of brandy and the doses were repeated whilst the ﬁght proceeded bumper being handed between the guns the men frenzied by drink would mix gunpowder with the spirits supposing that thus prepared there was better liquor heroes i think it need not be doubted that more actions were lost than gained by this custom how should drunken gunner aim his piece and what to289 290 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https mob of inebriated men in the tops or along the quarter but if privateersmen could be found able to swallow six quarts at draught they had customs besides that of drinking which must have tended to render them desperately hard and seasoned men it was their practice to keep their ships clear so that the deck was the only bed they had to lie upon hammocks were allowed chairs or tables they took their meals upon the deck and lay upon it preserving in this direction the old tradition of the buccaneers who denied themselves every imaginable comfort and convenience that they might never be mistaken anything else than the savage beasts they were it is in the superstitions of the sea that we must search the beginning and history of many of the customs which in modiﬁed forms lingered down to the period of late generation of seafarers they veined the life with elements both of humour and romance and i not scruple to say that much of the poetry of the profession of the sea has perished with the extinction of the simple forecastle credulities of other ages in the beginning of european navigation in the times of diaz cabot columbus 80 gama and earlier yet the mariner was roman catholic devout profoundly superstitious perpetually invoking the protection of the blessed virgin and the saints of heaven ﬁnding miracles in the common operations of nature peopling the deep with wondrous monsters glorifying its blue breast with the gleam and colour of the enchanted island gazing about him he sailed along and willing to believe anything he was told i could give you better illustration of this than the remark of the jesuit anthony sepp in his account of voyage from spain to paraguaná towards the evening says he we saw an entire rainbow quite across the sky resembling our resembling our rainbows though the worthy father supposed that rainbows in those unfamiliar seas were very different from the same radiant arches which span the showers of italy spain and germany they were prepared all sorts of wonders and their imaginations created what their eyes could not see the lightning was not that of europe the thunder was the reverberation of some hellish conﬂict between armies formed of ﬁends of satanic stature the very rain was unnatural being coloured religion or superstition if you will interposed to mitigate the horrors of perfervid fancy wrought familiar appearances into celestial expressions and instructed poor jack to calm his perturbed soul to quell the tempest to exorcise the mermaid to smooth the waters to disperse the horrid shadows of the electric storm with litanies efﬁgies of saints and spells of many different sorts thus pirard laval in churchill s collection of voyages vol 702 says we frequently saw great whirlwinds rising at distance called by the seamen dragons which shatter and overturn any ship that falls in their way when these appear the sailors have superstitious custom of repairing to the prow or the side that lies next the storm and beatin g naked swords against one another this custom long prevailed scores of similar practices may be traced to the primitive superstitions of sailors they unquestionably colour the old marine life and their extinction leaves the calling uncomfortably bald i think the stars in those aged stories seem to glow the richer the incense ﬂoating up to them from the little altar on the forecastle and the tender strains of hundred voices rising in some solemn melodious canticle the glory of the setting sun makes cloth of gold of the sails of those castellated fabrics and they look to ﬂoat over faery seas of purple we view them through that atmosphere of superstition in the midst of which those young and struck imaginations made their miraculous voyages to the indies and to the mighty shores of columbia washington irving gives several instances of columbus superstitious nature an example seeing all human skill bafﬂed and confounded columbus endeavoured to propitiate heaven by solemn vows and acts of penance by his orders number of beans equal to the number of persons on board were put into cap on one of which was the sign of the cross each of the crew made vow that should he draw

gutenberg ebook https is vanderdecken scientiﬁc american gentleman has been endeavouring to determine the paternity of the grisly and spectral commander of the flying dutchman i wish he had been successful ever since i read the cruise of the bacchante i have been bewildering my brains with the same problem the princely word of the royal midshipmen must be taken and it is plainly stated that at four clock on july 11 1881 the flying dutchman crossed our nothing can be clearer than that and besides there is the additional testimony of the reverend gentleman who accompanied the princes and edited their interesting observations strange red light of phantom ship all aglow in the midst of which light the masts spars and sails of brig two hundred yards distant stood out in strong relief she came this appearance is in strict correspondence with the tradition but i wish the vessel had not been brig i should not like to put my hand to it that such rig that of the brig was known in vanderdecken s days 81 you had masted craft in plenty the fourth mast being called the bonaventure also abundance of vessels the third mast rigged with lateen sail but fabric answering to what we term brig there was kind of vessel called brigandines but they carried the rig of neither the brig nor the brigantine we understand the term that vanderdecken ever shifts his ﬂag is not to be supposed yet there could be mistake mark what follows thirte en persons altogether saw her but whether it was van dieman or the flying dutchman or who else must remain the ships in company ﬂashed to know if the people of the bacchante had seen the strange red light so that probably shadowy being was ever testiﬁed to by greater number of eyewitnesses but the thing is placed beyond dispute by what followed at the ordinary seaman who had this morning reported the flying dutchman fell from the and was smashe d to and then at the next port we came to the admiral was also smitten there was nothing less to expect but indeed very great deal more an old sailor to whom i related this story said that certainly the appearance looked uncommonly like the flying dutchman and his part he was willing enough to believe it was if he had misgiving it lay in the smallness of the trouble that followed the fallin of young seaman from the masthead and the sarcumstance of hadmiral being took wuss wasn t consequences sufﬁcient if that there wessel wur the genuine phantom the baykant so he called her herself oughter ha got lost that s what would have happened when i was fust goin to sea but there s bin good many changes since then and who s agoin to say that that there curse ain t growed weak like physic wot s kept too long but be this it may there can be doubt that vanderdecken is still aﬂoat cruising about in ship that glows at night and whose rotten timbers are charged with the villainous quality of causing disaster and misery to vessels within the sphere of the horizon the ancient batavian ﬂoats in this is scientiﬁc age and it is really time that we found out who this dutchman is or was is there man clever enough to devise speciﬁc the neutralization of the evil inﬂuence of an endevilled structure let such medicine be discovered and i ll warrant lack of jacks willing to embark in quest of the spectral pest it would be venture worth starting company to undertake this company is intended to supply want that has long been the object would be twofold ﬁrst to render britannia s dominion of the sea more comfortable than it can be whilst vanderdecken is suffered to294 295 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https aimlessly about with freight of curses in his hold and death keeping at the masthead and secondly to supply the public with an attraction well it will be admitted that the flying dutchman would prove lucrative draw think of her moored just below london bridge and the charge shilling to view her small boys price we may take it that vanderdecken is heartily sick of his and life off agulhas and would gladly settle down to an immortality of still water and hollands without expecting an apology the quality of the air of the pool and the isle of dogs i think i see the ship in my mind s eye true portrait of craft of the seventeenth round barricadoed tops and crowned there with royal of faded yellow swivel or two aft and few rusty cannon lodged in wooden beds on her main deck and what would chat with vanderdecken be worth over steaming bowl of punch in his darksome cabin rip van winkle would be mere to hornpipe or this dutch skipper and what yarns could he spin of the amsterdam of his day of old schouten over at hoorn of van this and van that of the dutch admirals of the ﬁghts in the narrow seas of their high mightinesses opinion of cromwell and of the hydropathic treatment of the english at amboyna who is he marryat tells us that he was sea captain whose wife lived with her son philip on the outskirts of the small but fortiﬁed town of terneuse situated on the right bank of the scheldt but he starts spectre and remains undeterminable down to the last chapter when he along with his ship and his son falls to pieces weeping tears of joy i love the yarn but doubt the man if marryat is right vanderdecken is dead and gone his curse endured long enough only to enable his son to become an old it ﬁfty philip was twenty or thereabouts when his father s ghost ﬂew through the window now we know only too well that vanderdecken is still alive besides taking strictly nautical view of the question i am disposed to question the accuracy of the novelist on such grounds example these he represents the flying dutchman sailing along with royals and ﬂying jib when this canvas marryat paints it was not in use until the close of the last century 82 also he depicts her at one time being so extremely ethereal to be able to sail through ship though the phantom was formed of mist and snow and at another time being substantial enough to support the highly material form of philip when he stands upon her deck with his father i not ﬁnd the royal in use much before howe s and jervis s time the ﬂying gyb of the beginning of the eighteenth century at which date it ﬁrst appears was not the sail it now is literature abounds in spectral ships but there is only one vanderdecken and how consistently the old dutchman ﬁts in with the roughness and wildness of typical fancies one quickly sees when he is matched in his unearthly integrity with the reﬁned but entirely faithless interpretations or reconstructions of the legend by the poet or the romancer take instance thomas campbell s spectre boat where certain false ferdinand having broken maiden s heart is visited by her ghost at sea twas now the dead watch of the night the helm was lashed lee and the ship rode where mount etna lights the deep levantine sea when beneath its glare boat came row d by woman in her shroud who with eyes that made our blood run cold stood up and spoke what the wraith said was to this effect that ferdinand was false traitor whom his sweetheart s ghost wanders unfor given and that he was to come other words jump appease her indignation his having forced her to break her peace with heaven in the case of coleridge s mariner the spectre has her will and the last we hear of her and ferdinand and the boat book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https and round they went and down they went the cock crew from the how poor is all this superﬁne business of broken vows and revengeful spectres side by side with the rugged schnapps elling ﬁgure of old vanderdecken viewing the horny moon with curse in his eye or stumping the weather side of his castellated poop with under his arm campbell has also put into swinging melodious verse an old scandinavian legend which he calls the of in this poem he represents boat furiously rowed by ghosts whose shrouds were like plaids ﬂying loose to the storm the watchman sings out to know who they are and is answered we are dead we are bound from our graves in the west first to hecla and then to was the rest man s ear says campbell all this is not vanderdecken but the poet ﬁnely refers to the old dutchman when he sings of those curses which make horror more deep by the semblance of mirth and which at appal the chill d mariner s coleridge also sends spectral ship to his ancient mariner in the vessel that approaches him without breeze or without tide and whose sails glance in the sun like restless but instead of vanderdecken we have death playing at dice with woman how heartily the ancient mariner must have prayed that the woman would win certainly he could be true sailor who would not so pray this gambling fancy may be found in old german legends relating to the there is lack of stories referring to miscreants of all shades who sail about in in company with satan who plays day and night with them their souls but though the artless yarn of in its elements tale by defoe and exquisitely in keeping with the stormy seas of that part of the world to which jack has strictly conﬁned not strong and good enough number of monstrous perversions have been launched and the tradition buried under hill of absurdities example there is the german notion of ship whose portholes grin with skulls instead of cannons she is commanded by skeleton who holds an and she is manned by the ghosts of sinners but even here the inventor is unable to manage without our old friend vanderdecken and so he afﬁrms that any ship that encounters this horrid craft is doomed another version represents the flying dutchman being very nearly big the world the masts are so lofty that when boy goes up to furl sail years elapse before he is again seen and he then comes down an old man the germ of this may perhaps be found in that wondrous fabric of which sir thomas browne writes it had been sight only second unto the ark to have beheld the great syracusia or mighty ship of hiero described in athenæus and some have thought it very large one wherein were to be found ten stables horses eight towers besides gardens tricliniums and many fair rooms paved with agath and precious the enormous phantom ship takes seven years in tacking whales tumble aboard of her when she rolls just dart into the portholes or channels of earthly vessels her smallest sail is big europe and there is public house in every block one has to search elsewhere vanderdecken that he was dutchman and that the story is dutch ought to be presumed from the round plain bald and salt character of the yarn it is thorough of story spain may supply versions charged with spiritual elements and suggesting the inquisition with the embellishments of silver ﬂames and death s heads the french may make purgatorial job of the fancy and ruin it by an299 book the hammock by clark russell project gutenberg ebook https of priestly conceptions widely remote from the sea inspirations german imaginations may garnish it with unnece ssary horrors but it is in the holland version that we ﬁnd the true ocean tincture and the only narrative likely to be accepted by such complete ﬁll the dutch the english and the american forecastles yet who was vanderdecken an american writer founding his presumption on german publication says that the master of the phantom ship was one bernard fokke who lived in the seventeenth century he was noted his recklessness and daring and cased his masts with iron to enable him to carry canvas having contrived to sail to the east indies in ninety days he was looked upon sorcerer at last he and his ship disappeared and everybody said he had been carried off by the devil and forced to conﬁne his navigation to the ocean between the two southern capes of his crew none remain but the boatswain cook and pilot he is still to be seen and always hails ships and asks questions but they should not be then his ship will disappear sometimes boat is seen to approach his bark but when it reaches her all vanish suddenly others say he was nobleman named falkenber g who murdered his brother and his wife and was condemned eternally to sail about the north sea on his arrival at the he found boat with man in it awaiting him the man said in latin i have been expecting on which accompanied by the ghosts of his murdered brother and wife falkenber g embarked and was rowed over to phantom ship that lay off the coast this vessel is described painted grey with coloured sails and pale ﬂag she has crew and may be known at night by ﬂames which issue from her masthead but all this
