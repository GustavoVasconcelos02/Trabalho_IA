plumaged baltimore oriole short time each year but only the far southeastern part of texas is enlivened by this graceful active bird of our illustration which is so full of song that the woods are ﬁlled with music all the both of these birds seem hardly to belong to the north where somber colors seem more in harmony with severer climate the hooded oriole does not attempt the journey and when we see the baltimore winged ﬂame that darts and burns dazzling where er his bright wing turns in our northern woods we can not but ask with the poet how falls it oriole thou hast come to ﬂy in tropic splendor through our northern sky at some glad moment was it nature s choice to dower scrap of sunset with voice the hooded oriole has very narrow range reaching from texas southward through eastern mexico to honduras and during our northern winters it has the baltimore an associate it is social bird and frequents the home of man one writer relating his experience with this oriole says they were continually appearing about the thatched roof of our houses and the arbors adjoining insects they were more familiar than any of the other orioles about the it not only delights man by its song and beautiful coloring but its presence is also beneﬁcial it destroys countless adult insects and their birds and nature volume xii number 5 https hooded oriole seldom builds its nest higher than from six to twelve feet above the ground though in few instances it has been found high thirty feet james merrill in his notes on the ornithology of texas says the nests of this bird found here are perfectly characteristic and can not be confounded with those of any allied species they are usually found in one of the two following situations the ﬁrst and most frequent is in bunch of hanging moss usually at great height from the ground when so placed the nests are formed almost entirely by hollowing out and matting the moss with few ﬁlaments of dark hairlike moss lining the second situation is in bush growing to height of about six feet nearly bare stem throwing out two or three irregular masses of leaves at the top these bunches of dark green leaves conceal the nest admirably it is constructed of ﬁlaments of the mass just referred to with little spanis h moss wool or few feathers the lining they are rather wide and shallow orioles nests and though strong they appear thin and not infrequently the hooded oriole builds its nest in plants called the spanish bayonet or yucca in such situation the walls are constructed almost entirely of the ﬁbers of the plant torn from dried leaves these ﬁbers are tough and the nest walls are much more durable than when made with moss wool or vegetable down may be used lining but it is not uncommon to ﬁnd lining the hooded oriole is not free from the intrusion of feathered rascals major bendire says that it is considerably imposed upon by both the and the dwarf and in few instances parasitic eggs of both species are found in the same hooded oriole

be learned about the habits of birds even in casual observation of them we meet them from time to time it is well known that the english sparrow is not friendly toward other birds often driving them from their nests and even going so far to destroy both these and their young upon one occasion sparrow took possession of the partially completed nest of pair of martins in process of construction beneath the eaves of farmhouse when the martins returned with their load of mud its walls the sparrow intrenched within drove them away with scolding cries and ﬂuttering wings resisting all their attem pts at dislodging him time after time the attack was renewed all to avail there he was and there he proposed to remain but the plucky martins were not so easily vanquished they retired season only to renew the attack with increased vigor waging battle long and ﬁerce finally however they seemed to understand that their enemy had the better of them and bent their energies toward vengeance carrying mud in their beaks they built wall about the sparrow he sat in possession of their home surrounding him so completely that he was made prisoner in the very place where he had taken forcible possession and there they left him to his fate pair of robins selected nesting place in the fork of maple standing quite near house the chamber windows of which looked down directly into it sooner had they begun to carry sticks the foundation than pair of crow black birds with malicious intent pounced upon it and scattered the sticks in every direction taking advantage of the absence of the owners of the nest to carry out their mischief time after time did the robins repair the damage and begin afresh their work of construction sooner were they out of sight than the black birds tore the material out of the tree seemingly working in great haste to complete their depredation before the robins return stormy encounters amounting to pitched battles sometimes ensued when the marauders were caught by the irate home makers in the very act of tearing to fragments the work they were toiling so painfully to complete not one day only but several elapsed and still the battle continued the interested spectators though sympathetic were powerless to help the rightful owners of the home the black birds seemingly did not want the nest themselves they merely objected to the robins building there at last to the great relief of the ts their enemies gave up the ﬁght and allowed them to build the nest this they did laying their eggs and rearing their young without further annoyance many fat

capture and swallow round dozen of earth worms inside of ten minutes one day ﬂedgling was hopping across the lawn the mother bird alert and watchful not far away she had been feeding it but evidently its hunger had not yet been appeased it hopped to her side and began to make the coaxing noise heard when in the nest the parent approaches with food the mother bird paused moment looked about her then hopping to one side short distance she planted her feet squarely upon the ground caught one end of worm in her beak and commenced to pull the worm which was large one was not easily dislodged and tug hard she could she could not complete her capture evidently the worm was too long she fairly tipped over backward in her effort yet without avail all at once and quick ﬂash so to give it chance to

carolinensis ⅗ from chi acad sciences the antrostomus carolinensis in the wooded ravines and timbered swamps of the southern states the tells of its presence by frequently calling its own name it with the and the night hawk belongs to the family of goatsuckers and is closely related to the swifts the family includes about species of these peculiar birds nearly all being natives of the tropics though nearly every part of the world has representatives the range of the is quite limited it includes the states from virginia and southern illinois southward to the gulf of mexico and through mexico into central america it is also found in cuba is bird of the twilight and night hours silent during the daylight hours its penetrating voice which is remarkably strong may be continuously heard in the regions that it inhabits during the evening hours and time preceding the returning light of day it is said that on still evening its call may be heard more than one mile in its large eyes and head its loose and somber colored plumage its quiet ﬂight and nocturnal habits it resembles the owls its short bill and the shape of the wings permitting rapid ﬂight give it close relationship to the swifts its mouth is peculiarly ﬁtted the capture of insects the gape is enormous and when the mouth is fully open will measure nearly two inches from side to side it is also aided in ensnaring insects by the long whiskers at the base of the mouth it will catch and swallow the largest of the moths and though it seems almost incredible small birds not infrequently form part of its diet an observer found in the stomach of one among an indistinguishable mass of brownish matter small bone about half an inch in another stomach he found the remains of hummingbird only partially digested and well enough preserved him to identify the species langdon states that he examined the stomach of female that contained the partially digested body entire of swamp sparrow intermingled with the feathers of which were numerous remains of insects chieﬂy small while hunting food the ﬂies low often but few feet above the surface of the ground in this habit it differs from the which like the swifts seeks its food high in the air now and then it rests perching on old logs or fences from which it will launch forth in pursuit of prey which its keen eyes have sighted during the day it roosts in hollow trees or upon lar ge limb in some densely shaded spot it does not attempt to build nest the two dull white eggs are laid upon the ground or upon leaves in some secluded place in woods or thickets it is said that this bird when disturbed at its nest will remove either its eggs or the young the case may be to place of safety by carrying them in its mouth audubon relates the following incident which came under his observation when the either male or female each sits alternately has discovered that the eggs have been touched it rufﬂes its feathers and appears extremely dejected minute or two after which it emits low murmuring cry scarcely audible to i lay concealed at distance not more than eighteen or twenty yards at this time i had seen the other parent reach the spot ﬂying so low over the ground that i thought its little feet must have touched it it skimmed along and after few low notes and some gesticulations all indicative of great distress take an egg in its large mouth the other bird doing the same when they would ﬂy off together skimming closely over the ground until they disappeared among the branches and because of its habit its somber colors and its peculiar penetrating notes the well the was considered by the indians bird of ill omen an amateur circus t rue s tory we were not like ordinary fact i look back on our younger days it comes to ever more strongly how very unlike we were there was harvey my older brother who never did anything that other children did and was always perpetrating some most extraordinary thing which certainly one else ever would have thought of however in spite of this trait or possibly in consequence of it he afterwards became famous but that is neither here nor were all what the neighbors termed unexpected if they were kindly disposed otherwise it was some word to the same ef fect though less mild it was always great blessing to us and one which we received with thankful hearts that our father was man of science and his line of work made him the recipient of varied assortment of animals which he would bring home alive and keep until he was ready to work upon them it was only natural that birds and nature volume xii number 5 https 204children should become fond of these creatures and beg that they might be spared the eternal sleep and left to us to play with this was often granted so it happened at one time that we were the proud possessors of different kinds of birds animals and reptiles and the envy of all the children blocks around it is so long now since the time of which i write that i may not be able to recall them all but i give them i remember them and by their they had rank well names the highest in intelligence always going they did at our funerals when any one of the little colony died we would give it burial in accordance with its station in life first beside the grave would stand rex my beautiful dog whose knowledge was so great it seemed almost human then would come daisy harvey s little mexican pony then lorita the parrot whose intelligence was really remarkable after her came jackie the monkey and so on down the cat the crow with his one white tail feather then the smaller birds two brown thrush blue jay and the canary three baby foxes followed the birds and then came the squirrels gray red and ﬂying squirrels next to these stood the rabbits dozen or more of all kinds and colors belgian hares pure yellows angoras whites and blacks they came motley crew the weasel and muskrat were next and now the reptiles were beginning the turtles hellbender and the snakes black snakes garter snakes green snakes pufﬁng adder and last of all came two boa constrictors i have reserved special place my own dear stupid little hedge hog billy it used to grieve to always see poor billy straggling off at the end of the of the reptiles to be pathetic little ﬁgure of stupidity but harvey insisted he deserved better place possibly it was because he seemed so lonely and despised by the others but at any rate billy was an especial pet of mine and in order to disprove harvey s statement that it was impossible to teach it anything i spent much time and pains on billy and at last succeeded in teaching him to utter little grunt when i would scratch his back and ask want your supper billy but the thing that made the proudest was when he at last could go up stairs it was nearly three years before billy could accomplish the entire ﬂight and even then it was long and weary pilgrimage but the patience i had expended upon him had not been in vain it was comical to watch his little short forelegs trying to reach up to the next stair where he knew lump of sugar would be his reward but i am digressing one day father and mother having gone out of town to funeral we children were left to ourselves it was an opportunity not to be neglected and our brains were at work trying to plan some new game when harvey arrived in our midst triumphantly waving huge sheet of he called which in large letters were the headlines grand circus and then followed an account of the animals that would take part and the tricks they would perform harvey assigned us our himself being by right of his seniority and having thought of the game alice was the fat lady while i paul being the youngest was nothing but feeder of animals and tent shifter under the direction of the circus master we assembled the menagerie in cages or loose the case might be up in mother s it took good deal of time to get them all together polly was of roving disposition and had to be coaxed down from the top of tall tree where she had perched square or so away the crow was up on the roof the rabbits and hares were scampering all over the fact nothing but the caged animals seemed to be at hand but the task was ﬁnally accomplished and all were ranged around the room waiting harvey who had disappeared mysteriously some little time before suddenly there was most terriﬁc clatter and noise coming ever nearer and nearer we looked at each other with surprise when with ﬂourish of lariat and wild indian that rose above the deafening noise in dashed harvey upon daisy triumphant accomplished the difﬁcult feat of making the pony carry him up stairs he dismounted with jump ladies and gentlemen he began the ﬁrst act on the programme will be by this wonderful down on your haunches the lariat swept the air in true fashion and daisy obediently sat back on her haunches shake hands daisy the hoof came here rex interfered he realized the pony had business there and felt the responsibility which rested upon him good dog that he was he started toward her barking sharply though to say go know you have business then if his bark had been signal all the other animals lifted up their voices and while it was pandemonium let from polly calls of mamma from the crow which it could say plainly any parrot though its tongue had never been slit grunts and squeals mingled in utter confusion in the midst of it all who should walk in but uncle charles now we all knew that uncle was not disposed to pass over lightly even the least of our offenses and what he would say and what was more now we dared not think but harvey was equal to the occasion he knew uncle s weak point and went towards him nonchalantly swinging the snakes who stuck out their heads they swayed back and forth now to us children the snakes were just nice and pretty any of the animals but they were quite the opposite to uncle charles the great writhing things swaying to and fro they twiste d in harvey s hands and stuck out their heads in which the eyes dully gleamed ﬁlled him with loathing and disgust not unmixed with terror all that uncle charles had meant to say vanished from his mind he saw harvey advancing upon him with the and he began to retreat more and more rapidly but with ever decreasing dignity harvey still pursued why uncle we heard him say what s the matter there was charles had gone home but the circus was broken up i think it is better to draw veil over the consequences of our circus circus is complete without ours was exception we never had another least not in mother s room paul b rent on liot the leucosticte leucosticte tephrocotis the leucosticte or rosy finch it is often called is resident of the interior of british america during the warmer months in the winter it passes southward frequenting the rocky mountain region of the united states where it is quite common on the eastern slopes so far known within the border of the united states it only nests in the sierra nevada in california while on the slopes of the mountains this finch is usually seen in ﬂocks during the most severe weather it will frequent settled districts becoming quite tame and it has been known to seek the sheltering cover of the nests of clif f swallows under the eaves of buildings when in the ﬁelds it is restless bird and quite shy shufeldt while stationed at fort fetterman wyoming had an excellent opportunity to study the habits of this handsome bird he captured eight including both males and females which he placed in cage especially prepared them in few days they not only became accustomed to their quarters but apparently thoroughly satisﬁed and happy flocks of their companions passing over were certain to be called down to alight on the fences the ground and in fact everything in the neighborhood of the cage to even the cage the birds were given canary and ﬂax seeds cracked wheat and ﬁnally lettuce and other tender leaves all of which they seemed to relish dr shufeldt also birds and nature volume xii number 5 https every morning i approached the cage general and impatient chattering commenced their breakfast and bath and they immediately availed themselves of both in my presence often i deluged the entire cage birds and all with large watering pot and they enjoyed the sprinkling immensely later in the spring this part of the programme was followed by their pluming themselves in the sun chattering among themselves and the males giving utterance to low subdued and plaintive sort of song being different from the shrill whistle they gave to attract the attention of their passing fellows by the middle of may all the birds of this species had left the vicinity their breeding grounds further north shufeldt s captives did not even pair and early in july he released them their plumage seemed to be at its best in the early part of may another authority speaking of this bird s habits in the mountain regions says during summer and autumn the finch is common above timber line where it breeds ranging higher than the titlark and being usually found in the vicinity of snow ﬁelds and the frozen lakes near the summit of the range it is rather shy in such localities though exceedingly tame in winter its ﬂight is in undulating lines like the crossbills the only note i have heard it utter is kind of churr like the call of the scarlet tanager they stay above timber till the close of october or the middle of november they are perpetually roving from place to place feeding upon the seeds of weeds and grasses and are never at rest moment at time constantly whirling about in close dense masses like so many leucosticte leucosticte tephrocotis from chi acad sciences corundum and spinel corundum the mineral species corundum affords number of gems known by different names these differences arise from the fact that the stones were used gems before their mineralogical identity was discovered thus red corundum is know n the ruby and blue corundum the sapphire when corundum suitable gem purposes occurs of other colors such green yellow or violet the gems are sometimes known green yellow or violet sapphires respectively or by the name of another gem which they closely resemble in color with the adjective oriental preﬁxed such are the gems known oriental topaz oriental emerald oriental aquamarine oriental hyacinth oriental amethyst and oriental chrysolite colorless corundum is known leucosapphire while corundum of all colors is used gems it is only that which is transparent which can be so employed this is sometimes called noble corundum to distinguish it from common corundum the two however often occur together common corundum is used an abrasive emery being one of its varieties but it has gem value corundum is sesquioxide of aluminum with the percentages aluminum oxygen its hardness is 9 in the scale of which diamond is 10 and other mineral except the latter equals it in hardness this hardness gives it wearing quality gem second only to the diamond the varieties of corundum differ slightly in hardness sapphire being the hardest noble corundum has brilliant vitreous luster which while not equal to that of the diamond is superior to that exhibited by almost any other gem corundum is heavy mineral its speciﬁc gravity being four times that of water this high speciﬁc gravity affords an easy means of distinguishing the gems of corundum from those of other species corundum is infusible and is not attacked by acids it crystallizes in the rhombohedra l division of the hexagonal system certain crystal forms being characteristic of the two varieties ruby and sapphire thus ruby tends to crystallize in ﬂat rhombohedral crystals while sapphire generally forms in longer hexagonal prisms see colored plate in november number corundum is doubly refracting and dichroic of the different colors of corundum above referred to the blue or sapphire is most common the red or ruby next the other colors occur rather sparingly green having been almost unknown until the discovery of the montana sapphires the nature of the coloring ingredient of the different varieties of corundum is not known but there is some reason believing it to be chromium fremy obtained artiﬁcial red and blue corundum by mixing chromium with his other ingredients after many attempts to obtain the desired color had birds and nature volume xii number 5 https 209red corundum varies in hue from rose to deep red that of the latter tint is the true ruby the color known pigeon s blood being most highly prized faultless stones of this color have long been the most valuable of gems exceeding the diamond in price weight weight unless the latter is colored rubies above three carats in weight are about ten times more valuable than ordinary diamonds of the corresponding weights but few rubies exceeding ten carats are known the king of pegu is reported to have one the size of hen s egg but one has ever seen it the story may well be doubted in the crown of the empress catherine was however one the size of pigeon s egg there is also large uncut ruby in the british crown which ruskin calls the loveliest precious stone of which he has any knowledge the chief home of the ruby is burmah from its mines and those of siam and ceylon have come practically all the world s supply of rubies the most important burmese mines are in mogou k ninety miles north of mandalay the rubies were evidently formed in limestone which is now much decomposed and seem to have been the result of metamorphism of the limestone by the entrance of eruptive rocks the earth is known byon and the stones are obtained from it by washing the rubies are usually in the form of more or less complete crystals the mines have been worked since the british occupation of burmah in 1886 by british company and there can be little doubt that desire to acquire these mines was the chief reason the occupation the mines have not proved very proﬁtable however and only within the last year or two has the company been able to pay any dividends the hope of success has lain in the introduction of machinery washing the byon more cheaply than it could be done by the primitive native methods and it is now believed by the introduction of an electrical power plant that this has been accomplished this company now produces at least half the annual yield of rubies of the world previous to the english working of the mines the ruby mining was performed by local miners under control of the native government all rubies above certain size going to the king whenever ruby of unusual size was found procession of grandees with soldiers and elephants was sent out to meet it one of the titles of the king of burmah was lord of the rubies the siamese rubies come from near bangkok on the gulf of siam they occur in clay which seems to be the product of alteration of besalt these rubies are not equal in quality to those of burmah rubies are also found in the gem gravels of ceylon and in afghanistan miles east of cabul in our own country ruby corundum is occasion ally found in connection with opaque corundum in macon county north carolina in the gravels of caler fork of cowee creek of this county good rubies are found in sufﬁcient quantity to reward systematic mining them these rubies are mostly small but some gems of three or four carats weight and of excellent color have been obtained among the montana sapphires an occasional red stone is found but they not have the choicest red color another source of rubies is their artiﬁcial production after the method discove red by the french chemist fremy these are made by heating mixture of aluminum sesquioxide carbonate of lime barium ﬂuoride and potassium chromate in porous clay crucible to temperature of 1500 degrees and keeping the mixture ﬂuid eight days clear crystals up to of carat in weight are thus produced which have the hardness and color of native ruby they are not considered so valuable gems the latter and can be distinguished by the air bubbles which may be seen with lens the expense of making them is nearly equal to the value of native rubies so that their production is likely to be limited rubies were known to the ancients being mentioned in the bible in proverbs and job the greeks and romans ascribed to the ruby the power of giving light in the dark and the hindoos describe the abodes of their gods thus lighted the ruby was much worn an amulet being supposed to protect the wearer against plague poison and evil spirits it was also thought that it would turn dark if its owner were in danger and would not regain its color until the peril was over the ruby is usually cut in the form of the brilliant like the diamond but sometimes the step cut is advantageously employed the stones from india are usually rounded by the native gem cutters and worn in this manner blue precious corundum or sapphire is more abundant than the red or ruby like the red the blue color seems to be due to content of chromium since in the artiﬁcial crystals already mentioned produced by fremy both colors occur at times in the same crystal the blue color however unlike the reds disappears on heating blue corundum exhibits various shades from light to dark the color most highly prized being that known cornﬂower blue good sapphire should also have high luster and velvety sheen already noted sapphire is somewhat harder than ruby and it is also somewhat heavier the montana sapphires are said to be especially hard sapphires have at the present time not over half the value of ruby of the same size price of forty dollars per carat is an average one stone of not over ten carats and much larger stones are comparatively common the price does not increase so rapidly does that of the ruby with an increase in size the world s supply of sapphires comes chieﬂy from siam the most important mines of that country are those of battambong city southeast of bangkok the sapphires occur in sandy clay out of which they are washed the region is about hundred miles in length together with the sapphires occur some rubies especially in the southern part of the district sapphires also occur among the rubies of burmah but in small numbers the called gem gravels of ceylon furnish many sapphires though their quality is not equal to those of siam because of paleness of color in these gem gravels occur also ruby spinel garnet topaz amethyst tourmaline and hyacinth another locality sapphires discovered in the early eighties is banskar in cashmere india these stones were ﬁrst disclosed by the fall of an avalanche and later were discovered to exist in the region in considerable numbers time they could be cheaply purchased but are now jealously guarded by the government the montana sapphires have been known since 1865 but were not systematically worked until they occur in river sands east of helena and were ﬁrst obtained in washing gold now the mother rock has been discovered and this is mined the rock being taken out piled in heaps and submitted to the action of frost through the winter the sapphires thus become loosened and can be readily separated these sapphires are well crystallized and are of good average size though few gems exceed six carats in weight their luster and color are the most part of ﬁrst quality and the stones are in demand the best of jewelry noble corundum of other colors than those of blue and red is not of abundant occurrence nor is it ordinarily highly prized are the sapphire and ruby colorless sapphire or leucosapphire is sometimes used substitute the diamond from which it can readily be distinguished by its lower hardness and higher speciﬁc gravity certain specimens of both sapphire and ruby but especially the former exhibit when lighted star this appears beams of light radiating from center which changes in position the stone is turned such stones are called star or asteriated sapphires or rubies and are highly prized they are usually cut with rounded surface this best brings out the ﬁgure the cause of the ﬁgure is generally supposed to be the presence of countless microscopic cavities in the stone which are arranged parallel to the faces of prism the total reﬂection of the light from these causes the star others think that multitudes of twining lamellæ cause the appearance sapphire is word which is the same in nearly all languages in chaldean hebrew greek and latin it has the same form in modern tongues this fact testiﬁes to the ancient use of the stone in early times sapphire was believed to be destroyer of poison so that if put into glass with spider or venomous reptile it would kill it it was regarded also remedy against fevers spinel the group of spinel includes in mineralogy number of species of different though analogous composition the spinel employed gem is almost wholly conﬁned to the magnesium aluminate having the percentage composition alumina and magnesia this is usually of red color different birds and nature volume xii number 5 https 213giving gems known by different names follows deep red balas ruby or rubicelle violet red almandine ruby spinel is thus known among gems chieﬂy relative of the ruby and this sort of spinel will ﬁrst be considered the spinel rubies differ from the true or corundum rubies in hardness speciﬁc gravity and system of crystallization the hardness of spinel is 8 or about that of topaz and the speciﬁc gravity it is thus neither hard nor heavy corundum ruby again the system of crystallization differs spinel crystallizes in the isometric system and is usually found in the form of octahedrons while corundum ruby is hexagonal in crystallization see colored plate in november number spinel is singly refracting in polarized light and corundum doubly refracting spinel ruby is infusible before the blowpipe but on heating under goes curious series of changes in color which are quite characteristic the red changes ﬁrst to brown and then becomes black and opaque but on cooling the black changes to green then becomes nearly colorless and ﬁnally the stone resumes its original red color small percentage of chromium is usually found by analysis to exist in ruby spinel its color is generally considered to be due to this ingredient while the spinel ruby is considered of less value than the corundum ruby and is sometimes by fraud or error substituted the latter it yet has deﬁnite value gem and is sold under the name of spinel ruby or some of its varieties this value is usually reckoned at about half that of the corundum ruby although variations in quality of the stones well change s in demand cause differences of price thus emanuel mentions spinel ruby of good quality weighing 40 carats which in 1856 was sold two thousand dollars but which in 1862 brought at public auction only four hundred dollars in 1866 however it was again sold twelve hundred dollars the spinel ruby of the french crown jewels weighing 56 carats was in 1791 valued at ten thousand dollars not only is spinel ruby related to corund ruby in color and use but the two are frequently associated together in nature the gem gravels of ceylon siam australia and brazil contain both kinds of rubies and the ruby mines of upper burmah where the corundum ruby occurs in crystalline limestone produce also large quantities of spinel rubies spinel rubies also come in large quantity from badakschan in afghanistan near the river oxus the name of balas rubies by which they are often known being said to be derived from beloochis tan or balakschan the persians have tradition regarding these mines that they were disclosed by an earthquake which rent the mountain in twain the localities above mentioned furnish nearly all the spinel rubies of commerce few have been found in north america at hambur gh new jersey and san luis obispo california but these localities have never afforded any appreciable supply spinel rubies of great size are known bauer mentions the largest known

in many other colors besides red such orange green blue and indigo well white and black occasionally colorless spinels occur and they can not be distinguished by their behavior in polarized light from the diamond it is sometimes sought to substitute them the latter they can be detected at once however by their inferior hardness while spinels of any color if transparent and free from ﬂaws make desirable gems the only colors found in sufﬁcient quantity outside of the red to make an appreciable supply are the blue and the black the blue spinels resemble the sapphire in color though they are somewhat paler they come chieﬂy from ceylon and burmah where they occur together with the ruby spinel the black spinel is known ceylonite or pleonaste and is also obtained chieﬂy from ceylon although occurring of quality suitable cutting at mount vesuvius in italy like the ruby spinel can be made artiﬁc ially the process being to heat mixture of alumina and magnesia with boracic acid and if the red color is desired little chromium oxide the spinel ruby seems to have been known to the ancients equally with the corundum ruby and the two were probably often confounded the natives of india call

the vegetable kingdom have descended to us from remote times and from ancient associations the old terms are the most part founded either on the medicinal values of the plants or on some mythological fancy that accounted their creation or form the carnation derived its generic name from the latter source the term dianthus is derived from two greek words signifying ﬂower of jupiter while the speciﬁc name caryophyllus is obtained from words meaning nut and leaf origi nally applied to the clove tree but later given to the carnation because of its spicy fragrance again the word carnation is from the latin meaning ﬂesh and was deemed appropriate because of the pink and white color of the petals the name dianthus or ﬂower of jupiter originates in greek myth that had to with the establishment of olympus jupiter had escaped the unpleasant fate that befell his brothers namely of being swallowed by their unnatural parent saturn jupiter married metis prudence who straightway demonstrated the ﬁtness of her name by bestowing on saturn draught which caused him to disgor ge his domestic bill of fare and the sons banding together imprisoned their father and his brother titans

ﬁrst became known at that time there were about ﬁve hundred distinct varieties all of american origin the carnation is native of central and southern europe since its introduction into england it is said to have escaped cultivation and to have become ﬁxed in several localities in its cultivation three general classes have been established by english specialists the selfs are plants whose ﬂowers have uniform color the ﬂakes possess pure ground of white or yellow ﬂaked or striped with one color the stripes running longitudinally through the petals the bizarres are such have pure ground marked in the ﬂakes but with two or three colors this form possesses the most fragrance especially when there is frequent recurrence of the stripes lastly there are the picotees having pure ground each petal

conspicuous tree in winter the white trunk gleaming so distinctly through its shattered habiliments of bark it is said that this disastrous state of its coverin g is due to the inelasticity of the bark which does not expand to meet the requirements of the tree s growth does the bark of other trees hence the impoverished condition of its outer garment but when we see this sad state of conditions repeated on its human prototype we feel that we have more cause sympathy than ridicule so why not accord the tree the same commiseration but i am sure there is some legendary tale extant to the effect that in mythological days the tree was derelict from duty in some line or another and this was condemned to pass the rest of its days in tattered coat so was sentenced the white birch who arrived late at an important wedding of the gods hence doomed to wear her wedding garment of snowy bark throughout all ages in penance her dilatoriness but if the buttonwood wears the coat of poverty it is more

and mice seem to enjoy living in localities that are frequented by but few other animals they are also adepts at seeking food supplies and travel long distances when hunger demands and supply of food is not at hand the pocket rats are exception to this rule and some of the species live in dry arid regions where but little vegetation grows aside from few species of cactus the rat of our illustration was found by frank woodruf f in such locality where it had hidden under the sheltering branches of cactus the marked characteristic that gives these little animals their name is the pockets or cheek pouches these are external openings outside of the mouth and are lined with furry skin they are ample in size and the two will hold in some instances heaping tablespoonful of grain the ﬁlling is done so rapidly that where hard grain like wheat is used continuous rattling sound is made the ejecting of the grain from the pockets is aided by forward squeezing motion of the fore feet each foot making two or three quick forward passes some of the species seem to thrive in captivity and after few days not ﬁll their pouches apparently having learned that it is useless labor when obtainable their natural food consists of various plant seeds but when in the neighborhood of cultivated ﬁelds and the vicinity of houses they feed also upon grain and the vegetable waste from camps and houses stephens says that some of the species whose habits he has studied will eat about heaping tablespoonful each of wheat or barley in hours and one or two square inches of beet or cabbage they are often found in regions practically devoid of water large part of the year it is highly probable that they obtain the necessary moisture from succulent leaves in captivity they drink but little water stephens writes of one that he trapped that was evidently very hungry placing it in cage he gave it grain he says it was amusing to see the eagerness with which it immediately went to ﬁlling its pockets it stuffed them so full that it must have been positively painful and then it would not stop to eat but hunted about some exit not ﬁnding one it ejected the contents of its pockets in corner out of the ﬁrelight and went back more this time it ate little but soon gathered the remainder and deposited it with the ﬁrst after eating little more it reﬁlled its pockets and hunted about better

feet in length and at the highest point about eighteen inches from the ground he found them quite common in the vicinity of san diego california they are nocturnal in their habits seeking their food through the twilight and night hours and resting during the day in their burrows or in shaded places near the openings to them when resting the position of the feet and the arched back give them the appearance of hairy ball the tail is laid straight out from the body if space will permit or when the quarters are cramped it may be curled alongside the body the tail is quite useful it is used sort

from the table and shelled corn to the branch long piece of suet is always bound with cord this is my free lunch table spread all my bird friends who wish to come they have accepted the invitation beyond my expectation and have fully repaid all the trouble it has been to prepare them in the pleasure their company gives i sit just inside the window and they appear not to notice so that i have an excellent opportunity to note their peculiarities the one that comes every day and all day is the tufted titmouse he comes down with whir looks sharply about with his bright black eyes then takes taste of the suet or marrow and sometim es carries crumb away it is hard to tell how many of them come they all look so much alike not more than two or three ever come at once pair of downy woodpeckers are constant visitors at the meat table they seldo m come together but sometimes it is the male with his bright red head spot sometimes the female in her plain black and white stripe she is very plain indeed and somewhat more shy than her mate if an english sparrow comes to the shelf while either of them is on the branch it quickly drops down beside him if to say see here you are out of place and the sparrow leaves without taste of the good things occasionally winter wren with his comical tail and delicate manners calls on his way somewhere and makes pleasing variety in the appearance of the visitors he eats all he needs of the bread crumbs before leaving unless some sudden movement within startles him the blue jays are the most persistent and least welcome of all their plumage is beautiful viewed at such close range but their actions are not pleasing they ﬂop down near the window and look in turning the head from side to side if suspecting some enemy there the slightest sound sends them back to the trees but they soon return and eat if they were starved driving their bills into the meat with quick hard strokes or grabbing at the corn in nervous famishing way after eating few grains they ﬁll their mouths and carry it away to hide future emer gencies i have seen them hide it in an old gatepost or drive it down in the crevices of trees they carry away more than they eat and probably never ﬁnd half of it again they have special hiding place but they tuck it in wherever they see convenient place it is somewhat provoking to have the table cleared in this way unless it is always watched the corn is spread especially the cardinals whose brilliant color is such delight to the eye amid the sombre colors of winter there is one blue jay with drooping

spring song will repay all the corn they will eat but of all that come none are more interesting than the chickadee he surely merits all the bright sweet things that have been said or written about

tecoma radicans or what is generally known the trumpet flower in some parts of the country it is also called trumpet creeper the word tecoma is of mexican origin and means trumpet the only known difference between the tecoma radicans and the bignonia is structural difference in their pods we have several imported varieties of both that come from south africa and japan but none prettier than the tecoma radicans or trumpet flower which any of us can ﬁnd along almost any roadside or in rich moist woods blooming in the greatest profusion in august and september it is woody vine climbing to

clusters its tubular corolla is two or three inches long with ﬁve somewhat irregular lobes within which the four stamens are enclosed its fruit is pod containing numerous winged seed the trumpet

cultivated to some extent in hothouses and in tropical climates the common persimmon of the united states diospyros virginiana is tree usually growing to height of about ﬁfty or sixty feet and rarely reaching one hundred feet this is beautiful tree with more or less spreading branches the name persimmon is of indian origin and of unknown meaning the fruit of this species is but lightly appreciated except by those who visit the forest regions in which it is native it is only cultivated to very limited extent the fruit is globular in form and quite it varies both in size color and ﬂavor when green the fruit is astringent and has very disagreeable taste this however disappears when the fruit becomes fully matured it is generally thought that the fruit of the persimmon is not palatable until there has been frost regarding this supposition bailey says the old notion of early botanists that this fruit must be subjected to the action of frost before it becomes edible is erroneous many of the very best varieties ripen long before the appearance of frost while others never become edible being so exceedingly astringent that neither sun nor frost has any appreciable effect on this fruit so popular in the localities where it grows was not unknown to the natives who traversed the wild woods before the time of the early explorations and conquests of america narrative of soto s travels relates that his men who were camping at native town halfe league from rio grande mississippi river found the river almost halfe league broad and of great depth and that the natives brought to them loaves made of the substance of prunes like unto these loaves were made of dried persimmons possibly mixed with some pulverized grain at the present time in some southern localities the fruit is not infrequently kneaded with bran or ground cereals molded and birds and nature volume xii number 5 https 232 persimmons diospyros virginiana to alligators the alligator generally impresses the mind reptile so dangerous that he should be given wide berth on any and all occasions yet it is really peaceable and harmless unless aroused to the defensive anywhere south of the mason and dixon line among the rivers lakes and marshes are found the alligators but florida because of its great area of such places which the alligator delights in may almost be termed the home of the alligator in traveling through the dense hammock s where miles and miles the sun scarcely penetrates through the heavy timber and the rank vegetation beneath one may often meet with the huge sauri an he travels from one cave or mud hole to another tease or wound him and he will show ﬁght and woe to him who then comes within reach of his vengeance and it matters little to him with which end he must ﬁght he can crush equally well with his tail with his to end the matter more speedily he may use both but if you go on about your business his gator will the same and not notice you so much ever to wink come upon him he is lying asleep or sunning himself on mud bank if he is aroused and ﬁnds you between himself and the river he will sweep you aside you yourself would ﬂy from the sugar bowl and then slide into his native element and he does this so quickly to allow you little time to explain that you just happened there and had designs on him whatever at other times you might think you are stepping out onto sunken log imbedded in the mud but ﬁnd that the log suddenly gets very much alive under that slimy mud and grass an alligator was taking sitz bath you might have walked all around him with impunity but walking on him is an indignity he resents quickly that it is question whether you get back to safety or are served up the alligator s dinner sometimes you may see an alligator lying motionless just under the surface of the water with his long snout protruding his jaws are open far enough to allow the ﬂow of the current through them and when stray ﬁsh or other comes along with that ﬂow the jaws snap down on it he can be seen keeping his trap thus set hours at time should you row near in order to watch him he will not seem to pay the least attention to you if you behave yourself but if you drop an oar or shout at him he will drop down out of sight and lie low waiting to see what you are really up to now if you will remain perfectly quiet to motion but will imitate the barking of puppy the squealing of pig or the caw of crow although there was not an alligator in sight you will soon see several snouts appear and gradually if you keep up the call the alligators will come near and nearer in curiosity to what the call means half dozen or more will be nosing about the boat and you have good chance to observe them your nerves can stand it this sport is exceedingly dangerous if the boat should bump an alligator on the nose straightway all would make common cause and reduce the offending boat into splinters and that the occupant of the boat should escape would be next to impossible when the female alligator wishes to build her nest she selects dry place open to the rays of the sun yet near to water she commences her nest by scraping together lot of dry leaves grass or other trash until she has round compact bed large cartwheel on this she deposits her eggs this done she proceeds to cover them up by going round and round the nest and with her body pushing more leaves and trash over the eggs well made nest is of the shape of and very nearly so large the nest completed the alligato r goes off to the nearby water and leaves the sun to the hatching many differ to the time it takes the eggs to hatch much depends on the construction of the nest and also on the heat of the sun so also many differ to the number of eggs female will lay in one season some aver that eighty is the average number but the writer has never found more than forty in one nest alligator eggs are white oblong in shape about three inches and half in length and have ring around the middle when ﬁrst hatched the little fellows are red and black spotted and striped they are exceedingly lively and soon hatched make straight the in search of the protecting care of their they often come back to sun themselves about the old nest the male alligator is cannibal and will eat his own young if he ﬁnds them this reason the female selects place far from the usual haunts of her spouse when she prepares maternal cares by building her nest and she stays with her babies until she thinks they are capable of wiggling away from dangers themselves when in florida many of the winter tourists secure these little alligators and take them north to keep them pets they are exceedingly slow in growing they make little and cunning pets many years when they get to be big fellows they had best be dispensed with although the alligator has long been considered one of the despised species of animals or reptiles it is far from being useless its use is only practical after it has been killed one may say that there is good alligator but dead one but one may qualify the remark by adding that the dead one is very good indeed commercial birds and nature volume xii number 5 https is great demand alligator hides and good prices are being paid them consequently the hunting of alligators the sake of their hides and the preparing of them shipment is proﬁtable industry then the tanning of these hides and ﬁnally the making of the leather into trunks valises purses makes three distinct industries due to the alligators those making business of hunting alligators generally take the night time it and the darker the night the better two men provided with light skiff good riﬂe an ax and bull s eye lantern fastened to the forehead of one of the hunters start out together one one with the in the bow of the boat it is his busine ss to shine the eyes of any alligator who might come within the radius of the light the eyes of the game will shine like two balls of ﬁre and if the man is careful to make unnecessary movements and his partner is careful to scull the boat steadily and silently they can get so near the game to almost touch it the man in the bow holds from the very start the riﬂe ready quick shot this shot comes so suddenly and so unexpectedly to the alligator that quick he generally is he falls prey to his prolonged curiosity to the nature of that approaching light the hunters must be so expert at their trade that soon the shot has been ﬁred the man who did the shooting must lean over and grasp the alligator by the tail pull him half way over the gunnel of the boat and hold him there the quick cut with the ax in the back which his partner must be by this time prepared to strike all this is done far quicker than it can be told so quickly is it done that often the alligator is killed by the ax only and it is found that the bullet had never struck him and he had only been either stunned or so demoralized to get his own power this cut in the back severing the verteb rae places the alligator entirely hors combat there is even ﬂopping about in the bottom of the boat where he is then thrown now the hunters are ready to proceed on to their next capture the morning generally ﬁnds the hunters with their boat loaded and they are glad of short rest there then remains but the task of skinning their game and salting the hides down in barrels ready shipment leo s tra tner dandelion taraxacum taraxacum from trimen s medicinal plants dandelion taraxacum taraxacum karst you are bilious my good man go and pay guinea to one of the
