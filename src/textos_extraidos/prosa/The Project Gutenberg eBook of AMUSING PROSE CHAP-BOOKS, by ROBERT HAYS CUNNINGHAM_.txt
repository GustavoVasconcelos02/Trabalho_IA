years there has been largely increasing interest on the subject of folklore in its various departments in such respects there has been very considerable change in the feelings and tastes of the educated population of this country from what there was several generations ago formerly the educated classes appeared to think that anything relating to the tastes or ideas of the common people was of very little interest 5 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https in the course of some two hundre d years back leaving out the present time the number of writers who thought it worth their while to deal with such topics were not much more than dozen in number including such men aubrey bourne brand hone strut halliwell etc now all that is changed and it has been discovered that much of extreme interest can be learned from the superstitions habits beliefs tastes customs ideas amusements and general social life of the uneducated or lower classes of previous times not the least interesting or least important of the many sources from which information on these and similar matters can be obtained is that of the people earliest popular the beginning at little after the commencement of the eighteenth century and continuing over hundred years afterwards right up to the general introduction and use of cheap magazines and cheap newspapers the was almost the only kind of reading within the reach of the poorer portion of the nation what adds greatly both to the interest attaching to the literature and to its importance is the fact that these literary productions if they may be so termed were almost entirely written by the people themselves that is they were written by the people the people this fact intensiﬁes the conviction that they give true and unvarnished description of the lower orders and their ways then now every district had its proportion of local geniuses who had gift above their fellows in the matter of storytelling or some other such way and in many instances these narratives became and were printed and reprinted times without number at the variou s printing establishments over the country devoted to business of that description with regard to this feature in literature already referred ly that it was composed by the people the people and thus gives true portraiture of many features in their social more may be said it being the case that not few of those who hawked these cheap volumes over the country were themselves the authors of some of them and in the composition of the chaps to considerable extent just reproduced circumstances incidents and narratives that they had met with in their wanderings over the country to very marked degree was this the case in the most prominent of all the scottish book dougal graham see his works two volumes octavo collected and edited by geor ge macgregor in it would appear that at an early period of graham peregrinations he accompanie d prince charlie army in throughout its various fortunes pursuing his trade hawker of sundry articles that might be in demand by the prince retainers after that event was over graham continued the calling of hawker and chapman at the same time becoming the author of number of books but after while he got step or two further on ﬁnding such an immense demand his extremely amusing though coarse volumes he ultimately set up printing press of his own the purpose of producing his chaps and supplying the chapmen with them by whom they were spread broadcast over the country the knowledge of such instances this lends much additional value to the containing forcible description of the social life and ideas of the masses in former times slight study of this department of literature will show that there was then now much variety in the tastes of the people and we also ﬁnd that in this respect the various tastes could be fairly well met from among the stores of the publisher in these days just at the present time there had been any amount of enterprise on the part of authors and publishers in furnishing readers with whatever their fancy might desire the litteratura vulgi may be fairly well divided into the following or similar classiﬁcations biographical religious romantic poetical humorous fabulous supernatural diabolical legendary superstitious criminal etc the strictly religious appear to be the fewest in number the supernatural and the superstitious elements appear to have been more in demand the supply of such classes seems to have been greater these days the marvellous had evidently very great 6 7 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https the romantic likewise had been in great request old romance s handed down from the days long before printing was invented continued up till last century to be of undiminished interest also from the number of poetical chaps that have come down to us it is evident that the demand them had been great all over the country the most popular of all however appears to have been the humorous section which again might be subdivided into variety of departments each with numerous representatives the love of fun and frolic was apparently deeply implanted in the feelings and tastes of previous generations of the present printing establishments devoted to the production of were pretty well scattered all over the country in england the principal places appear to have been london york birmingham and newcastle in scotland the towns of glasgow stirling falkirk and montrose appear to have carried off the palm in that respect in ireland there had been few places besides dublin and belfast the immense volume of business done in the production of the and its importance an article of trade all over the country

thousands of chapmen and printers employees an instance of the proﬁts derivable from the business an article of trade one publisher of and that not in an especially large way is known to have retired

acquainted with merry jovial cobbler it was the custom of king henry the eighth to walk late in the night into the city disguised to observe and take notice how the constables and watch performed their duty not only in guarding the city gates but also in diligently watching the inner parts of the city that so they might in great measure prevent those disturbances and casualties which too often happen in great and populous cities in the night and this he did oftentimes without the least discovery who he was returning home to whiteha ll early in the morning now on his return home through the strand he took notice of certain cobbler who was constantly up at work whistling and singing every morning the king was resolved to see him and be acquainted with him in order to which he immediately knocks the heel off his shoe by hitting it against stone and having so done he bounced at the cobbler stall who there cries the cobbler here one cries the king with that the cobbler opened the stall door and the king asked him if he could put the heel on his shoe yes that i can says the cobbler come in honest fellow and sit thee down by and i will it thee straight the cobble r scraping his awls and old shoes to one side to make room the king to sit down the king being hardly able to forbear laughing at the kindness of the cobbler asked him if there was not house hard by that sold cup of ale and the people up yes said the cobbler there is an inn over the way where i believe the folks are up the carriers go from thence very early in the morning with that the king borrowed an old shoe off the cobbler and went over to the inn desired the cobbler would bring his shoe to him thither soon he had put on the heel again the cobbler promised he would so making what haste he could to put on the heel he carries it over to the king saying honest blade here is thy shoe again and i warrant thee it will not come of f in such haste again very well says the king what must you have your pains couple of pence replied the cobbler well said the king seeing thou art an honest merry fellow there is tester thee come sit down by i will drink full pot with thee come here good health to the king with all my heart said the cobbler i pledge thee were it in water so the cobbler sat down by the king and was very merry and drank off his liquor very freely he likewise sung some of his merry songs and catches whereat the king laughed heartily and was very jocund and pleasant with the cobbler telling him withal that his name was harry tudor that he belonged to the court and that if he would come and see him there he would make him very welcome because he was merry companion and charged him not to forget his name and to ask any one him about the court and they would soon bring him to him said the king i am very well known there now the cobbler little dreamt that he was the king that spake to him much less that the king name was harry tudor therefor with great deal of conﬁdence he stands up and puts off his hat makes two or three scrapes with his foot and gives the king many thanks also telling him that he was one of the most honest fellows he ever met with in all 14 15 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https lifetime and although he never had been at court yet he should not be long before he would make holiday to come and see him whereupon the king paying what they had drunk would have taken his leave of the cobbler but he not being willing to part with him took hold of his hand and said by my faith you must not go you shall not go you shall ﬁrst go and see my poor habitation i have there tub of good brown ale that was never tapped yet and you must go and taste it you are the most honest blade i ever met withal and i love an honest merry companion with all my heart c hapter ii how the cobbler entertained the king in his cellar and of the disturbance they had like to have had by his wife joan so the cobbler took the king with him over the way where he had his cellar adjoining the stall which was handsomely and neatly furnished man of his profession into the cellar he took the king there said he sit down you are welcome but i must desire you to speak softly fear of waking my wife joan who lies hard by showing the king close bed made neatly up at one corner of the cellar much like closet if she should wake she will make our ears ring again at which speech of the cobbler the king laughed and told him he would be mindful and follow his directions whereupon the cobbler kindled up ﬁre and fetched out brown loaf from which he cut lusty toast which he sat baking at the ﬁre then he brought out his cheshire cheese now says he there is much fellowship in eating in drinking which made the king admire the honest freedom of the cobbler so having eaten bit the cobbler began health to all true hearts and merry companions at which the king smiled saying friend i pledge thee in this manner they ate and drank together till it was almost break of day the cobbler being very free with his liquor and delighting the king with several of his old stories insomuch that he was highly pleased with the manner of his entertainment when on sudden the cobbler wife joan began to awake says the cobbler you must begone my wife joan begins to grumble she awake presently and i would not half the shoes in my shop she should ﬁnd you here then taking the king by the hand he led him up the stairs saying farewell honest friend it sha be long before i make holiday to come and see thee at court thou shalt be kindly welcome replied the king so they parted the king on his way to whitehall and the cobbler to his cellar and there putting all things to rights before his wife joan got up he went to work again whistling and singing merry he used to be being much satisﬁed that he happened on so good and jovial companion still pleasing himself in his thoughts how merry he should be when he came to court c hapter iii how the cobbler pr epared himself to go to court and how he was set out in the best manner by his wife joan now soon the king came home he sent out orders about the court that if any one inquired him by the name of harry tudor they should immediately bring him before him whatever he was without any further examination 16 17 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https cobbler thought every day month till he had been at court to see his new acquaintance and was troubled how he should get leave of his wife joan he could not get without her knowledge by reason he did resolve to make himself ﬁne he could his wife always keeped the keys of his holiday clothes whereupon one evening they sat at supper ﬁnding her in very good humour he began to lay open his mind to her telling her the whole story of their acquaintance repeating it over and over again that he was the most honest fellow that ever he met withal husband quoth she because you have been so ingenious to tell the whole truth i will give you leave to make holiday this once you shall go to court and i will make you ﬁne i can so it was agreed that he should go to court the next day whereupon joan rose betime the next morning to brush up her husband holiday clothes and make him ﬁne she could she washed and ironed the and made his shoes shine that he might see his face in them having done this she made her husband rise and pull off his shirt then she washed him with warm water from head to foot putting on him clean shirt afterwards she dressed him in his holiday clothes pinning his laced band in prim c hapter iv the cobbler r eception at court with the manner of his behaviour befor the king the cobbler being thus set forth he strutted through the street like crow in gutter thinking himself ﬁne the best of them all in this manner he came to the court staring on this body and on that body he walked up and down and not knowing how to ask harry tudor at last he espied one he thought in the habit of to whom he made his address dost thou hear honest fellow you know one harry tudor who belongs to the court yes said the man follow and i will bring you to him with that he had him presently up into the guard chamber telling one of the yeomen of the guard there was one that inquired harry tudor the yeoman replied i know him very well if you please to go along with i bring you to him immediately so the cobbler followed the yeoman admiring very much the prodigious ﬁnery of the rooms which he carried him through he thought within himself that the yeoman was mistaken in the person whom he inquired said he he whom i look is plain merry honest fellow his name is harry tudor we drank two pots together not long since i suppose he may belong to some lord or other about the court i tell you friend replied the yeoman i know him very well you but follow and i shall bring you to him instantly so going forward he came into the room where the king was accompanied by several of his nobles who attended him soon the yeoman had put up by the arras he spoke aloud may it please your majesty here is one that inquires harry tudor the cobbler hearing this thought he had committed less than treason therefore he up with his heels and ran it but not being acquainted with the several turnings and rooms through which he came he was soon overtaken and brought before the king whom the cobbler little thought to be the person he inquired after therefore in trembling condition he fell down on his knees 18 19 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https may it please your grace may it please your highness i am poor cobb ler who inquired one harry tudor who is very honest fellow i mended the heel of his shoe not long since and which he paid nobly and gave two pots to boot but i had him afterwards to my cellar where we drank part of cup of nappy ale and we were very merry til my wife joan began to grumble which put an end to our merriment that time but i told him i would come to the court and see him soon conveniently i could well said the king be troubled would you know this honest fellow again if you could see him the cobbler replied y es that i will among thousand then said the king stand up and be not afraid but look well about you peradventure you may ﬁnd the fellow in this company whereupon the cobbler arose and looked wistfully upon the king and the rest of the nobles but it was to little or purpose though he saw something in the king face which he thought he had seen before yet he could not be harry tudor the heel of whose shoe he had mended and who had been so merry companion with him at the inn and at his own cellar he therefore told the king he did not expect to ﬁnd harry tudor among such ﬁne folks he saw there but that the person he looked was plain honest fellow adding withal that he was sure that did harry tudor but know he was come to court he would make him very welcome says the cobbler when we parted he charged to come to court soon and see him which i prom ised i would and accordingly i have made holiday on purpose to have glass with him at which speech of the cobbler the king had much ado to forbear laughing out but keeping his countenance steady he could before the cobbler he spoke to the yeoman of the guard here said he take this honest cobbler down into my cellar and let him drink my health and i will give orders that harry tudor shall come to him presently so away they went the cobbler being ﬁt to leap out of his skin joy not only that he had come of f so well but that he should see his friend harry tudor c hapter the cobbler entertainment in the king cellar the cobbler had not been long in the king cellar before the king came to him in the same habit that he had on when the cobbler mended his shoe whereupon the cobbler knew him immediately and ran and kissed him saying honest harry i have made an holiday on purpose to see you but i had much ado to get leave of my wife joan who was loath to lose so much time from my work but i was resolved to see you and therefore i made myself ﬁne i could but i tell thee harry when i came to court i was in peck of troubles how to ﬁnd you out but at last i met with man who told he knew you very well and that he would bring to you but instead of doing so he brought before the king which almost frighten ed out of my seven senses but faith i resolved to be merry with you now since i have met you at last aye that we shall replied the king we shall be merry princes now after the cobbler had drunk about four or ﬁve good healths he began to be merry and fell his old songs and catches which pleased the king very much and made him laugh heartily 20 21 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https on sudden several of the nobles came into the cellar extraordinary rich in apparel and all stood uncovered before harry tudor which put the cobbler into great amazement at ﬁrst but presently recovering himself he looked more wistfully upon harry tudor and soon knowing him to be the king whom he saw in his presence chamber though in another habit he immediately fell upon his knees may it please your grace may it please your highness i am poor honest cobbler and mean harm said the king nor shall receive any here i assure you he commanded him therefore to rise and be merry he was before and though he knew him to be the king yet he should use the same freedom with him he did before when he mended the heel of his shoe this kind speech of the king and three or four glasses of wine made the cobbler be in good humour before telling the king several of his old stories and singing some of his best songs very much to the satisfaction of the king and all his nobles the cobbler song in the king cellar come let us drink the other pot our sorrows to confound we laugh and sing before the king so let his health go round i am bold bold can be cobbler was ruder then here good fellow here to thee remembering harry tudor when i at work within my stall upon him i will think his kindness i to mind will call i eat or drink his kindness was to so great the like was never known his kindness i shall still repeat and so shall my wife joan i laugh when i sit in my stall and merrily will sing that i with my poor last and awl am fellow with the king but it is more i must confess than i at ﬁrst did know but harry tudor resolves it shall be so and now farewell unto whitehall i homeward must retire to sing and whistle in my stall my joan will desire i but think how she shall laugh when she hears of this thing that he that drank her ale was england royal king 22 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https hapter vi how the cobbler became courtier now the king considering the pleasant humour of the cobbler how innocently merry he was and free from any design that he was person that laboured very hard and took great deal of pains small livelihood was pleased out of his princely grace and favour to allow him liberal annuity of forty merks year the better support of his jolly humour and the maintenance of his wife joan and that he should be admitted one of his courtiers and that he might have the freedom of his cellar whenever he pleased which being so much beyond expectation did highly exalt the cobbler humour much to the satisfaction of the king so after great many legs and scrapes he returned home to his wife joan with the joyful news of his reception at court which so well pleased her that she did not think much at the great pains she took in

and complained of deer with collar round its neck that he had seen running through his grounds and had done him much damage desiring them to hunt it down and kill it they wishing better sport on the next day put the old farmer request into execution in doing of which they did much damage to the neighbouring grounds whose owners together with colonel nutcombe to whom the deer belonged came and complained to the schoolmaster of the injuries they had suffered by his scholars they were very severely reprimanded and hard threatened the same the resentment of the present reproof and the fear of future chastisement made them abscond from the school and going into brick about half mile from tiverton there they accidentally fell in company with some gipsies who were then feasting and carousing this company consisted of seventeen who were met on purpose festivity and jollity which by plenty of meat fowl ﬂowing cups of beer cider they seemed to enjoy to their hearts content in short the

having dug below the root of the laurel tree she could not ﬁnd the treasure when he was further initiated he was consulted in important matters and met with better success generally giving satisfaction by his wise and sagacious answers in the meantime his parents sorrowed after him one that was more having advertised him in all the public papers and sent messengers after him to almost every part of the kingdom till about year and half afterwards when carew hearing of their grief and being struck with tenderness thereat repaired to his father house he was so disguised they did not know him but when they did their joy was beyond expressing tenderly embracing him bedew ing his cheeks with tears and kisses and all his friends and neighbours showed every demonstration of joy at his return his parents did everything to render home agreeable to him but the uncommon pleasure he had enjoyed in the community he had left their simplicity freedom sincerity mirth and frequent change of habitation and the secret presages of the honour he has since arrived at sickened and palled all other diversions and at last prevailed over his ﬁlial duty one day without taking leave of his friends

morning ﬁnding himself very hungry he got up and walked about asking those he met to give him halfpenny to keep him from starving but nobody stayed to answer him and only two or three gave him anything so that the poor boy was soon in the most miserable condition being almost starved to death he laid himself down at the door of one fitzwarren great rich merchant here he was soon perceive d by the who was an creature and happened just then to be very busy dressing dinner her master and mistress so seeing poor dick she called out what business have you there you lazy rogue there is nothing else but beggars if you not take yourself away we will see how you will like sousing of some dish water i have here that is hot enough to make you caper just at this time fitzwarren himself came home from the city to dinner and seeing dirty ragged boy lying at the door said to him why you lie there my lad you seem old enough to work i fear you must be somewhat idle indeed sir says whittington that is not true i woul d work with all my heart but i know nobody and i believe i am very sick want of food poor fellow answered mr fitzwarren dick now tried to rise but was obliged to lie down again being too weak to stand he had not eaten anything three days and was longer able to run about and beg halfpenny of people in the streets so the kind merchant ordered that he should be taken into his house and have good dinner immediately and that he should be kept to what dirty work he was able the cook little dick would have lived very happily in this worthy family had it not been the crabbed cook who was ﬁnding fault and scolding him from morning till night and was withal so fond of roasting and basting that when the spit was out of her hands she would be at basting poor dick head and shoulders with broom or anything else that happened to fall in her way till at last her of him was told to miss alice fitzwarren daughter who asked the creature if she was not ashamed to use little friendless boy so cruelly and added she would certainly be turned away if she did not treat him with more kindness 119 120 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https though the cook was so fitzwarren footman was quite the contrary he had lived in the family many years was rather elderly and had once little boy of his own who died when about the age of whittington so he could not but feel compassion the poor boy the footman was very fond of reading he used generally in the evening to entertain his when they had done their work with some amusing book the pleasure our little hero took in hearing him made him very much desire to learn to read too so the next time the footman gave him halfpenny he bought hornbook with it and with little of his help dick soon learned his letters and afterwards to read about this time miss alice was going out one morning walk and the footman happening to be out of the way little dick who had received from fitzwarren neat suit of clothes to go to church on sundays was ordered to put them on and walk behind her they walked along miss alice seeing poor woman with one child in her arms and another at her back pulled out her purse and gave her some money and she was putting it again into her pocket she dropped it on the ground and walked on luckily dick who was behind saw what she had done picked it up and immediately presented it to her besides the of the cook which now however was somewhat mended whittington had another hardship to get over this was that his bed which was of ﬂock was placed in garret where there were so many holes in the ﬂoor and walls that he never went to bed without being awakened in his sleep by great numbers of rats and mice which generally ran over his face and made such noise that he sometimes thought the walls were tumbling down about him one day gentleman who paid visit to fitzwarren happened to have dirtied his shoes and begged they might be cleaned dick took great pains to make them shine and the gentleman gave him penny this he resolved to lay out in buying cat if possible and the next day seeing little girl with cat under her arm he went up to her and asked if she would let him have it penny to which the girl replied she would with all her heart her mother had more cats than she could maintain adding that the one she had was an excellent mouser this cat whittington hid in the garret always taking care to carry her part of his dinner and in short time he had further disturbance from the rats and mice but slept sound top soon after this the merchant who had ship ready to sail richly laden and thinking it but just that all his servants should have some chance good luck well himself called them into the parlour and asked them what commodity they chose to send all mentioned something they were willing to venture but poor whittington who having money nor goods could send nothing at all which reason he did not come in with the rest but miss alice guessing what was the matter ordered him to be called and offered to lay down some money him from her own purse but this the merchant observed would not it must be something of his own upon this poor dick said he had nothin g but cat which he bought penny that was given him fetch thy cat boy says mr fitzwarren and let her go whittington brought poor puss and delivered her to the captain with tears in his eyes he said he should now again be kept awake all night by the rats and mice all the company laughed at the oddity of whittington adventure and miss alice who felt the greatest pity the poor boy gave him some to buy another cat 121 122 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https and several other marks of kindness shown him by miss alice made the tempered cook so jealous of the favours the poor boy received that she began to use him more cruelly than ever and constantly made game of him sending his cat to sea asking him if he thought it would sell much money would buy halter at last the unhappy little fellow being unable to bear this treatment any longer determined to run away from his place he accordingly packed up the few things that belonged to him and set out very early in the morning on allhallow day which is the ﬁrst of november he travelled far holloway and there sat down on stone which to this day is called whittington stone and began to consider what course he should take while he was thus thinking what he could bow bells of which there were then only six began to ring and it seemed to him that their sounds addressed him in this turn again whittington lord mayor of london lord mayor of london says he to himself why to be sure i would bear anything to be lord mayor of london and ride in ﬁne coach well i will go back and think nothing of all the cufﬁng and scolding of old cicely if i am at last to be lord mayor of london so back went dick and got into the house and set about his business before cicely came down stairs the ship with the cat on board was long beaten about at sea and was at last driven by contrary winds on part of the coast of barbary inhabited by moors that were unknown to the english the natives in this country came in great numbers out of curiosity to see the people on board who were all of so different colour from themselves and treated them with great civility and they became better acquainted showed marks of eagerness to purchase the ﬁne things with which the ship was laden the captain seeing this sent patterns of the choicest articles he had to the king of the country who was so much pleased with them that he sent the captain and his chief mate to the palace here they were place d is the custom of the country on rich carpets ﬂowered with gold and silver and the king and queen being seated at the upper end of the room dinner was brought in which consisted of the greatest rarities sooner however were the dishes set before the company than an amazing number of rats and mice rushed in and helped themselves plentifully from every dish scattering pieces of ﬂesh and gravy all about the room the captain extremely astonished asked if these vermin were not very of fensive oh yes said they very offensive and the king would give half his treasure to be free of them they not only destroy his dinner but they disturb him even in his chamber so that he is obliged to be watched while he sleeps the captain who was ready to jump joy remembering poor whittington hard case and the cat he had entrusted to his care told him he had creature on board his ship that would kill them all the king was still more overjoyed than the captain bring this creature to says he and if she can really perform what you say i will load your ship with wedges of gold in exchange her away ﬂew the captain while another dinner was providing to the ship and taking puss under his arm returned to the palace in time to see the table covered with rats and mice and the second dinner in fair way to meet with the same fate the ﬁrst 123 124 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https cat at sight of them did not wait bidding but sprang from the captain arms and in few moments laid the greatest part of the rats and mice dead at her feet while the rest in the greatest fright imaginable scampered away to their holes the king having seen and considered of the wonderful exploits of puss and being informed she would soon have young ones which might in time destroy all the rats and mice in the country bargained with the captain his whole ship cargo and afterwards agreed to give prodigious quantity of wedges of gold of still greater value the cat with which after taking leave of their majesties and other great personages belonging to the court he with all his ship company set sail with fair wind england and after happy voyage arrived safely in the port of london one morning fitzwarren had just entered his and was going to seat himself at the desk when who should arrive but the captain and mate of the merchant ship the unicorn just arrived from the coast of barbary and followed by several men bringing with them prodigious quantity of wedges of gold that had been paid by the king of barbary in exchange the merchandise and also in exchange puss fitzwarren the instant he heard the news ordered whittington to be called and having desired him to be seated said whittington most heartily i rejoice in the news these gentlemen have brought you the captain has sold your cat to the king of barbary and brought you in return more riches than i possess in the whole world and may you long enjoy them fitzwarren then desired the men to open the immense treasures they had brought and added that mr whittington had now nothing to but to put it in some place of safety poor dick could scarce contain himself joy he begged his master to take what part of it he pleased since to his kindness he was indebted the whole this wealth is all your own and justly so answered fitzwarren and i have doubt you will use it generously whittington however was too to keep all himself and accordingly made handsome present to the captain the mate and every one of the ship company and afterwards to his excellent friend the footman and the rest of fitzwarren servants not even excepting crabbed old cicely after this fitzwarren advised him to send trades people and get himself dressed became gentleman and made him the offer of his house to live in till he could provide himself with better when whittington face was washed his hair curled his hat cocked and he was dressed in fashionable suit of clothes he appeared handsome and genteel any young man who visited at fitzwarren so that miss alice who had formerly thought of him with compassion now considered him ﬁt to be her lover and the more so doubt because whittington was constantly thinking what he could to oblige her and making her the prettiest presents imaginable fitzwarren perceiving their affection each other proposed to unite them in marriage to which without difﬁculty they each consented and accordingly day the wedding was soon ﬁxed and they were attended to church by the lord mayor the court of aldermen the sherif fs and great number of the wealthiest merchants in london and the ceremony was succeeded by most elegant entertainment and splendid ball

fault the mayor said that their misdemeanours they should be that night in prison and upon amendment being neighbours he would release them in the morning they thanked the mayor and tom tram prevailed so far with friend of his that he borrowed three shillings which three shillings he spent upon his which made the poor men be ruled by him and what he enjoined them to so when the mayor was gone to

fees c hapter iii how t om served his hostess and t obacco another of his jests it happened that tom was sent on an errand forty miles from his abode over heaths and plains where having dispatched his business he chanced to be lodged in room that opened into yard where his hostess kept many turkeys which tom seeing he thrusts pins into two of their heads and in the night they died the woman in the morning wondered how the fowls should come to die tom persuaded her that there was great sickness where he dwelt amongst all manner of fowls and wished his hostess to ﬂing them away which she did tom watched where she ﬂung them and when he took his leave of his hostess it was at such time when she was busy setting bread into the oven so that he was sure she could not look after him so he goes and wraps the turkeys in his coat and away he runs but ﬁnding his two turkeys heavy he sees man that sold tobacco up and down the country at the foot of hill when he alighted to lead his horse down the hill at the bottom of which he falls down and lies crying if he had broken one of his legs and makes to the man most piteous lamentation that he was six or seven miles from any town there being house near and that he was like to perish want of succour the man asked where he dwelt he said with knight to whom tom did live jester the man knowing the knight and thinking tom leg had really been broken with much ado lifted him upon the horse when tom was mounted he prayed the man to give him his master turkeys tom made the horse to gallop away crying out i shall be killed i shall be killed my leg what shall i my leg the man seeing him gone stood in amaze and knew not what to think nevertheless he durst not leave his turkeys behind him fear of displeasing the knight but carried them lugging along fretting and swearing in his boots till he came to the next town where he hired horse to overtake tom but could not until he came to the knight house where tom stood to attend his coming looking out at the window when the man alighted tom then called to him so loud that most of the house heard him said he now i see thou art an honest man i had thought you had set upon your headstrong horse on

the man with drink while he in the meantime went to the host and told him they came to be merry and money was short with him and desired he would lend him ten shillings upon his horse the host having so good pawn lent it him knowing it would be spent in his house so tom went and gave the man ﬁve shillings the hire of the horse and spends the other ﬁve shillings freely upon him by that time the day was pretty nigh spent so that the man could get further that night but tom and his companions took their leaves and returned home and the man went his way to bed little suspecting the trick tom had put upon him in the morning the man rising betimes thinking to be gone could have but one horse unless he paid ten shillings tom had left word with his host that paying the money he should have both horses the man seeing himself cozened again by tom paid the ten shillings and wished all such cheating knaves were hanged away he went fretting and foaming to see himself abused c hapter how t om

willing he to be in that comp any but they were coming home one of them cut the reins of tom bridle so that when tom mounted on his horse the reins broke and the horse ran away with him in the midst of great heath whereon stood large gallows against which the horse stood and rubbed his neck so that the gentleman hooped and hallooed and said farewell tom farewell but tom alighted from his horse and made fast his reins and with his sword cut three or four chips from off the gallows and at the next tavern tom met with them where they jeer him not little but tom very earnestly entreated them to forbear yet the more he entreated them the more they played upon him but to be even with them in the morning tom calls the hostler and sends him nutmegs and ginger and gets grater and when he had grated them he also grated the chips off the gallows and mixed with the spice only little nutmeg and ginger he laid towards one end of the trencher himself and with gallon of ale into the gentleman chamber he goes begging of them not to mock him any more with the gallows and he would give them that ale and spice and so says he gentlemen i drink to you all now soon he had drank the hostler called him he gave him charge before so to down stairs runs tom fast he could the gentlemen made all possible speed to drink up the ale and spice before he came up again and that was what tom desired when he came again seeing all the ale and spice gone he says gentlemen will you know why my horse carried to the gallows yes says one of them well says tom it was to fetch you some spice to your ale and if you want i have more you and with that showed them the chips out of his pocket and away he runs leaving the gentlemen to look one upon another studying how they should be revenged on him c hapter vi

that it was some rich lady they stayed while and the person they expected to be with them not coming they fell to their meat and at last to the cake but it was not long in their stomach before it began to work so that all began vomiting and were so sick that they disordered the house in which time tom shifts himself into man apparel and with staff in his hand came where his gossips were and

master son you see had come from beyond foreign parts in france and spain young gentlemen used to go before buonaparte or any such was heard of and sure enough there was dinner given to all the people on the ground gentle and simple high and low rich and poor the ould gentlemen were the gentlemen after all saving your honour presence they swear at body little to be sure and maybe give one cut of whip now and then but we were losers by it in the end they were so easy and civil and kept such rattling houses and thousands of welcomes and there was grinding rent and few agents and there was hardly tenant on the estate that did not taste of his landlord bounty often and often in the year now it another thing matter that sir i better be telling you my story well we had everything of the best and plenty of it and we ate and we drank and we danced and the young master by the same token danced with peggy barry from lovely young couple they were though they are both long enough now to

to molly cronohan the fairy woman to speak word about the bracket heifer that was bewitched and so i was crossing the stepping stones at the ford of ballyashenogh and was looking up at the stars and blessing why it was lady missed my foot and souse i fell into the water alive thought i i be drowned now however i began swimming swimming swimming away the dear life till at last i got ashore somehow or other but never the one of can tell how upon dissolute island i wandered and wandered about there without knowing where i wandered until at last i got into big bog the moon was shining bright day or your fair lady eyes sir with your pardon mentioning her and i looked east and west and north and south and every way and nothing did i see but bog bog bog i could never ﬁnd out how i got into it and my heart grew cold with fear sure and certain i was that it would be my barrin place so i sat down upon stone which good luck would have it was close by and i began to scratch my head and sing the ullagon when all of sudden the moon grew black and i looked up and saw something all the world if it was moving down between and it and i could not tell what it was down it came with pounce and looked at full in the face and what was it but an ﬁne one ever ﬂew from the kingdom of kerry so he looked at in the face and says he to says he you well i thank you sir says i i hope you well wondering out

lark little i knew the trick he was going to serve knows how far up he ﬂew then said i to him thinking he did not know the right road home very why i was in his power says i your honour glory and with

sure i was in disconsolate condition and kept roaring out the bare grief when all at once door opened right in the middle of the moon creaking on its hinges if it had not been opened month before i

maids teaching them in natural way how to get good wives and husbands approved by several that have made trial of them it being the product of years study by our loving friend poor t om the king lover of mirth but hater of t reason in tw parts par t reading over many ancient histories it was my chance to meet with this story of an old woman who lived in the west who took delight in studying her fortune when she found herself full twenty years old she thought her luck worse than some who were married at ﬁfteen or sixteen which much troubled her mind but to prevent all doubts she resolved to try story she had often heard her mother talk of and ﬁnding it true she resolved to teach other maidens on time this old woman having newly buried her husband was taking walk in the ﬁelds the beneﬁt of the air sometimes thinking of the loss of her husbands she had had three yet had great desire the fourth so it happened she was walking alone she espied young maiden by the good morrow maid said the old woman how you are not you well yes mother i am very well but somewhat troubled in mind what is it troubles you so much if i can i will willingly relieve you therefore be not ashamed to tell the truth is it anything of great concern 158 159 160 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https indeed mother seeing you urge so much i will tell you the truth we are three sisters the youngest was married about year ago the middlemost last week and i am the eldest and man heeds well daughter if this be all i believe i can assist thee when i was young i was in the same condition and with reading some histories found out the art to know him that should be my husband which if you will keep my counsel i am ready to teach thee i will truly and if you will so much i shall think myself much obliged to you and if my fortune proves right i will make you amends why then i will tell you in the ﬁrst place you must observe agnes day which is the 21st of january and on that day let man speak to thee and at night when thou liest down lay thy right hand under thy head and say these words the god of hope let dream of my love then go to sleep soon possible and you shall be sure to dream of him who will be your husband and see him stand before you and may take notice of him and his complexion and if he offer to salute thee honourably not deny him but show him much favour thou canst but if he offers to be uncivil be sure to send him away and now daughter the counsel i have given you be sure to tell nobody so fare you well till i see you again i give you thanks your advice but one thing more i have to say what is your name and where you live i will tell you daughter my name is mother bunch and i live at place called bonadventure where if you come i will make you welcome now mother bunch having departed from the maid she met another pretty girl good morrow mother bunch good morrow pretty maid whither are you going this morning methinks you are

who have skill in choosing or else it may be i would be glad of good husb and be sure to take my advice be wise in choosing that is to say take one that has got red head be sure he loveth smock so well that he will scarce let his wife have good one to her back nor of yellow hair he is inclinable to be jealous nor black man he is dogged aye but mother if i must not have yellow black nor red what colour must i take why daughter i tell you if he is jealous you will be annoyed by his speeches how can young woman forbear when she is always provoked and be sure if he is jealous of thee thou mayest well be so of him evil people and thieves think ill of each other but hold little one thing more i have to say to you and that is to take notice of thy sweethearts when they come to thee i mean of their civil behaviour if they swear vow and make great protestations then have care of thyself many words breed dissimula tion therefore have care of such but if man come to thee that is sober and civil behaved there are hopes of his proving good man now mother i will take my leave of you giving you many thanks your good advice and so farewell till i see you again and i intend to take this counsel another time mother bunch was in little meadow not far from her house on the 30th of april before sunrising handsome maid seeing her alone came to her and said mother bunch good morrow how you

you talk so merrily come daughter it is great matter merry talk does harm but drives the time away but hark daughter i have had three husbands myself and i think to have another and you think i am so mad to tell him all i then my daughter i have another way to tell you who must be your husband i have proved it true and it is the best time of the year to try it therefo re observe what i say take thomas onion pare it and lay it on clean handkerchief under your pillow and you lie down say these good thomas right and bring my love in dreams this night that i may view him in the face then go to

you many thanks your good counsel and intend to take your advice upon time mother bunch being at wedding where young men and maids were met who had mind some discourse with her one young man said mother bunch we know you are woman that has judgment in many things i pray tell my fortune i can not tell fortunes said she but thou blinkest too much with one eye to be true to one woman aye but mother says another what think you of thou mayest come to marry lady if thou canst but lay great wager with her three to one and if she wagers with thee thou wilt be very likely to win thou hast mettle in thee but have care she win not the odds if she does thou art clean gone so farewell now mother bunch took her leave and going home she met maid going to wedding how you mother thank you daughter whither are you going to the wedding i believe but hark you mother will you sit down little i have something to say to you what is it daughter when shall i be married would you fain be 163 164 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https yes mother if i could get good husband then daughter i will tell you the best i can if you will take my advice in the month of january are many dangerous days thee to take notice of these are the ﬁrst second third fourth and ﬁfth there are great many more but if thou marriest on these days thy husband will cuckold thee or thou wilt make him one or else you will soon be parted by one means or other but all there be so many bad days in this month i can tell you of one day which is lucky and many young men and maids have deal of heart ease on that day or the day after i shall let you understand it is the 21st called agnes day this agnes has great favour young men and maids and will bring their sweethearts if they follow my rules upon this day you must be sure to keep fast and neither eat nor drink all that day nor at night neither let man woman nor child kiss thee on that day and thou must be sure when thou goest to bed to now agnes play thy part and send to my own sweetheart and show such happy bliss this night to dream of sweet kiss and be sure to fall asleep soon you can and before you awake out of your ﬁrst sleep you shall see him come before you and shall perceive by his habit what tradesman he is and be sure thou declare not thy dream unto any one in ten days and by that time thou mayest see thy dream come to pass all this i have proved three times i have had three husbands and they all proved tradesmen the ﬁrst was straw joiner the second maker and the third gentle craft and he came to with his awl in his hand and so i waked out of my dream but i thought the time long till he came again all maids that desire to be married i know some maids would wait in order to have husband with the best conditions and endowed with the best qualiﬁcations nay they would have impossibilities but i am afraid they will make good the old proverb that says you will not when you may when you would you shall have nay therefore take my advice if young man comes to you of civil carriage and you think you can love him be not scornful to him but give him civil encouragement according to his behaviour and to young men my advice is they be wary in their choice since there is much danger in choosing of wife husband wherefore all young men take my advice choose not one with long nose scolding brow and thin lips in such there is great danger he who is tied to scold is tied to sorrow choose not one who is counted slut if she be slut she is idle also and these two companions will bring thee to poverty nay besides this the old saying is slut will poison the gout and if you ca eat with her you wo sleep with her but this is the best way of choosing wife take one love not riches which ﬂy away true love never varies and where that is the blessing of god is if you desire to live long life be not overfond of riches but choose civil handsome maid who is not given to pride such maid may make ﬁne wife but she that brings handsome fortune will be always throwing it in your teeth which often occasio ns great disturbances therefore let this sufﬁce those who desire to get good wives and take notice of what i have already said and you may fare the better and young maids this is my advice if they will not try agnes let them be sure to choose clever honest man who is able to support them in comfort par t ii 165 166 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https michaelmas day mother bunch sitting on the bank of river joining to neighbouring

daughters i will sit in the midst of you where i shall read over very interesting lecture my real motive is to give you full account of some rare and excellent curiosities in my golden closet newly

know the name of the man whom you shall marry let her seek in the summer time green peasecod in which there are nine pease when you have done this either write or cause to be written on slip of paper these come in my dear and never fear writing which you must carefully close within the aforesaid peasecod and lay the same under the threshold of the door and then observe the next man that comes into the house you shall certainly be married to one of the same name secondly she that desires to be satisﬁed whether she shall get the man desired or let her take two in the morning and wear them all the day under her then at night let her not fail to take them and rub the four posts of the bed with the same which being done in your ﬁrst sleep he will seem to come and present you with couple of choice lemons if not there is hope thirdly she that is desirous to know what manner of fortune she shall marry whether gentleman tradesman or traveller the experiment is thus take walnut hazel nut and nutmeg crack the two nuts and take off the scurf peel them clear from the kernels and grate part of the nutmeg to them this being done bruise the kernels of the nuts and mix them with butter and sugar making them up into peels which are to be taken just when you are lying down in your bed then if your fortune be to marry gentleman your sleep will be ﬁlled with ﬁne golden dreams variety of sweet music and many running footmen if tradesman great noise and tumults if traveller who is seaman then frightful visions of lightning and roaring thunder will disturb your sleep this has been often tried and often approved fourthly agnes day i have not wholly blotted out of my book but i have found more exact way of trial than before you shall not need to abstain from kisses nor be forced to keep fast from glance of your love in the night if you can rise to be at the parish church door punctually between the hours of twelve and one in the morning and then and there put only the of your right hand into the of the said door repeating the following words three times sweet agnes now draw near with my true love let him appear 172 173 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham

lines seven times some guardian angel let have what i most earnestly crave valentine endowed with love which will both kind and constant prove then to your great content you shall either have the valentine of him you desire or at least one much more excellent sixthly the experiment of the midsummer smock found in better manner than before by my painful study in philosophy and now daughters quoth she take particular notice it is thus let seven of you together on midsummer eve exactly at the sun setting go silently into some garden and gather each of you sprig of red sage then return to some private room prepared particularly that purpose with stool placed in the middle each one of you having clean smock turned the wrong side outwards hanging upon line across the room then let every one lay her sprig of red sage on clean plate of rosewater set on stool which done place yourselves in row where continue till twelve or one saying nothing whatever you see after midnight each one sweetheart or husband that shall be will take each maid sprig out of the rosewater and sprinkle his love smock and those who are so unfortunate never to be married their sprigs shall not be moved and in consequence hereof many sobs and heavy sighs will be heard this has been very often tried in our own country and never failed of the desired ef fect these things i have found out of late to make young lovers fortunate and now my dear daughters i have but few more words to say at this time and they are by way of caution in the twelve months i ﬁnd above one and thirty very unfortunate days and therefore you regard the future happiness of your lives take care that you not enter into wedlock upon those days now your better instruction i tell you which they be in january there are four the 7th

with rapturous hearts returned her their hearty 174 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https after mother bunch had done dinner the young men came to wit tom the miller ralph the thatcher and robin the ploughman with great number of other trades and callings all whom mother bunch invited to sit down that she might deliver her wholesome counsels to them and ﬁrst she begins with tom the miller saying ah tom thou art sad wild young fellow there is not maid that can come to the mill but thou will be fooling with them but take my word it if you not leave off in time you will certainly spoil all your fortune what woman you think having portion will have such one she may justly conclude that you will still run catterwauling after young wenches and leave her to sigh and weep want of domestic know what i mean tom yes yes mother quoth tom but sure you not take such one yes tom i and am seldom mistaken it is you millers that ﬁll the country so full of headed maidens that when an honest husband comes to marry he ﬁnds the hearts already stolen away but farewell i have more to say to such fellow you then turning to ralph the thatcher she said i ﬁnd you are very desirous of wife and your ambition is such that she must be rich young and beautiful can not you content yourself with honest joan to whom you gave promise of marriage and now i ﬁnd you have mind to leave her which if you and obtain such one you desire i can tell you what will follow she wo stand picking of straws with you her fair face will ﬁnd many friends in corner and you may chance to be cuckold and indeed but justly served in your kind and therefore i advise you to return to your old love she is very honest girl and therefore far more ﬁt you than such gay butterﬂy you have lately followed then she stretched forth her hand to robin the ploughman saying thou art an honest fellow and good fortune will always attend thee i mean not bags of gold nor heaps of silver but thou shalt have careful and industrious wife one that will ever be willing and ready to labour true and faithful and one that will be cheerful partner in thy weal and woe to comfort and support thee under the greatest and most severe trials the poet has that burden may be borne by two with care which is perhaps too much one to bear honest robin this is thy happy fortune and thou art downright honest fellow i am glad to ﬁnd it so thus mother bunch went round the room and told them what would be their doom if they her daughters did betray and steal their maiden hearts away each would be punished with bride by whom he should be hornify but if they were right honest men each of them should have fortune then this said she did her blessing give in love and happiness to live which when they did the same receive of mother bunch they took their leave declaring she had told them more than they understood before 175 176 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https

budget into his pillow to rest his drowsy head upon and the courtier country house not being far off he immediately caused his servants to take him up very softly and carry him thither then to put him in stately bed in the next chamber pull off his foul shirt and put on him clean one then convey away his old clothes and lay rich ones by him this was punctually observed the tinker being thus laid slept soundly till evening when rousing up between sleeping and waking and being dry drunkards usually are he began to call some drink but was greatly frighted to ﬁnd himself in such palace furnished with lights and attendants about him that bowed to him and harmonious music accompanied with most charming voices but none of them to be seen whereupon looking his old clothes and budget he found muff and rich attire glistening with gold by him which made him fancy himself metamorphosed from tinker to prince he asked many questions but in vain yet being willing to rise the attendants arrayed him in the richest attire so then he looked on all sides admiring the sudden change of fortune and proud peacock when he spreads his tail against the glittering beams of the sun and being arrayed they had him into another room where was costly banquet prepared and placed him in chair under ﬁne canopy fringed with gold being attended with wine in gilded cups at ﬁrst he strained courtesy but being entreated to sit down the banquet being solely at his disposal he fell to most heartily then after supper they plied him with so much wine to make him dead drunk then stripped him and put on his old clothes they carried him they had brought him and laid him in the same posture they found him being all this time asleep and when he awoke he took all that had happened before vision telling it wherever he came that he had really and verily dreamed he had been prince telling them well he could all that had happened but plainly he saw now again his fortune would raise him higher than to mend

giving him strong liquor he often complained of it in the town saying though some had praised sir john liberality and how free he was of his liquor yet his own part he could say such thing having ever found him so stingy and niggardly that not so much one sup of his famed march or october beer could he get this being babbled about came to the courtier ears who was resolved to punish his sauciness

them very joyfully but they had sooner gotten him down but shutting to the door close they ordered him to strip immediately at the which he much wondered and began to make excuses on account of the blackness of his hide which would be very undecent and unseemly but they pretended it was the way of the cellar when new comer was to be made free of it but never after how oft soever he came he being willing to comply that he might have his skin full of good liquor that might prove both meat and cloth to him off went his leathern doublet breeches shoes stockings and hat shirt he had none having pawned it to his hostess that morning three noggins of brandy then taking frisk or two in merry vein they surprisingly whipped him up by the heels and put him into full butt of strong beer the upper head being taken up that purpose so he dipped over head and ears like duck that dives yet after he had recovered his legs it was but just shoulder deep when upon winding of the horn whilst he would have been scrambling out down came sir john demanding what was the matter they told him the tinker was not content to drink full horns at the cock but would needs go in to drink all at draught aye said he this is thirsty soul indeed but since he undertakes to drink it he shall it none of my servants shall drink it now he has washed his dirty hide in it crying to him with an angry voice sirrah

seeing the threatening danger he dropped down again six or seven times till fearing to carry the jest too far he gave him short respite telling him now he could not report abroad he was so very niggardly of his drink he had or might have enough of it then bidding his servants to take him out and ordered him to depart or drink it up which he thought ﬁt and thus he went away laughing the tinker who was at ﬁrst very angry but being cheered up with cordial dram and so made sensible that all this was but frolic and that the future their master would be his good friend if he behaved civilly he was paciﬁed and so putting on his clothes he beat the road gang of merry fellows of his acquaintance informing them there was hogshead of march beer at sir john which they all might be partakers of if they choosed they came joyfully and had it brought into the in black jacks after they had drunk it the tinker told them the cause of its being given away was because there was swine that had unexpectedly fallen into it but on further inquiry he told them all the circumstances which set them till their sides were almost cracked afterwards they had plenty of victuals sent them and the tinker being thus made free of the cellar was ordered to call at the house and have victuals and drink often he came that way and so they departed spreading the fame of sir john in every place

that he was much pleased with his conversation and often gave him money and one day put him upon frolic seeing him an apt fellow he had seen an old curmudgeon farmer sleeping and nodding on his horse he came from market and giving the tinker directions what to when he should come by knowing his hour and delivering him parcel of crackers and other ﬁreworks he caused him to be dressed in raw hide with horns when the tinker according to order with the help of servant having stopped the farmer horse while the rider was sleeping pitched four stakes one at each corner of the pannel and ungirting

horse used to with the nodding farmer who having the reins about his wrist by his kicking he awaked and seeing himself on frightful beast which he took beelzebub he cried out when the taking blew up him and the pannel and made him to fall quash to the ground so that the tinker made off with the stakes and pannel the old man sooner got up but he fell to running crying out the devil the devil and

him that if he would kill him the butcher he told him would send him to jail and punish him at the next sessions having one justice clodpole on his side who was his landlord and whose house he served with meat and doubted not would hearken to anything he said against him although ever so false and unjust sir john having listened to his complaint and laughed bid him be of good cheer himself would try the dog adventure upon this he ordered some clothes to be brought which the tinker stripping put on and the knight put on his except his shirt and taking his budget pike staff kettle and hammer away he went beating his kettle and crying work tinker till he came near the butcher house the dog soon heard the tink tink and away he runs to meet the tinker they laughing to see how he would fright him but sir john having now thrown down his budget was ready to receive him with the pike end of the staff and after the dog wheeled he returned and advanced eagerly to ﬂy at his throat but he thrust the pike of his staff into his breast upon which he ran away howling and tracing the ground with his blood till he came to his master where he died at this he was so much enraged that he carried constable and seized the knight who purposely made resistance so taking him before justice he made very great complaints against him the justice very gravely demanded what the fellow was brought before him the butcher said please your worship fur killing my servant aye said the justice he looks like villain therefore write his mittimus and see he be ironed lest he make his escape i beseech your good worship not to be so rash and hasty said the knight to pass sentence upon so hard pray ask this butcher what servant of his i killed ay said the justice let him speak then in truth said the butcher i ought in conscience to speak the truth it was but dog but such dog i say i would not have taken the best ﬁve guineas in the country you see sir he had rare qualities over other dogs he would not only fetch home my sheep out of the ﬁeld when i wanted them and save that trouble but you see justice he would go and drive home couple and sometimes half dozen of wild sheep which nobody owned or i did not think ﬁt to inquire after or they after so that he made thriving man besides he was the safeguard of my house and i believe that he killed him on purpose that he might rob ay ay said the

merry tales of tom h odge and his t he p ref ace not to detain the reader with many words to little purpose i shall only here observe that tom hodge with the rest of his old companions belonging to the school of cockermouth were walking on very pleasant morning in may and having tired themselves with pranks and intrigues towards evening they sat themselves down on green bank beneath lovely oak where they agreed amongst themselves that everyone should tell tale or pay ﬁne and because tom was the eldest scholar it was concluded and agreed upon that he should begin ﬁrst says tom w ith all my heart so i begin my part t ale once upon time when the opinion was common in england that those whose age and experience enabled them to determine the consequences of certain actions were wizards and witches there was queen in this realm whose name was elizabeth and by reason that the famous town of lancaster was strangely pestered with witches the queen sent some judges down to arraign and try them in order to bring them to justice 187 188 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https the news of this court being to be kept in lancaster spread through all the country so that husbandman living near forty miles from that place hearing of this news and believing they were come to tell the folks whether they were witches or not resolved to go to be satisﬁed in himself he was possessed with fear that he was witch because he had wart grew on his neck which he imagined to be dug his wife who had friend in corner and was therefore glad of his absence did not only give her consent but also dressed him in his best leathern suit and hat so taking leave of his good wife joan he trudged on day and night until he came to the place where the court was kept so rushing on and pressing through the crowd the crier of the court believing him to be some evidence gave orders that they should let him in which was soon done and he was required to speak what he had to say why says the countryman d see i dug upon my neck which makes afraid i am witch and volks tell that these vine gentlemen pointing to the judges can tell body whether one is witch or the crier of the court seeing the simplicity of the man said my friend i can assure thee thou art witch thou lookest more like cuckold than witch or conjurer i thank you zur and zo zays these vine gentlemen then having given three or four scrapes and half dozen congees he came back wise waltham calf the next day he was met by his wife who waited his return at the town end to whom she said well husband what the gentlemen say are you witch or witch sweet wife they tells body one looks more like cuckold than witch or conjurer why say you so replied she i prithee go back and have them taken up witches except they had been so they would not have known you were cuckold this merry tale so pleased them that they set up hearty laugh which being ended the second boy began his tale in the following manner t ale ii in the days of yore when this land was governed by many kings among the rest the king of canterbury had an only daughter and she was wise fair and beautiful her father sent forth decree that whoever would watch one night with his daughter and neither sleep nor slumber he should have her the next day in marriage but if he did either he should lose his head many knights and squires attempted it but lost their heads now it happened young shepherd grazing his ﬂock near the road said to his master zur i zee many gentlemen ride to the court at canterbury but see return again shepherd said his master i know not how they should they attempt to watch with the king daughter according to the decree and not performing it they are all beheaded well said the shepherd i try my vorton zo now vor king daughter or headless shepherd and taking his bottle and bag he trudged to court now in his way he was to cross river over which lay plank down he sits and pulls off his shoes and stockings to wash his feet lest the smell of his toes might be the means of keeping her awake while he was washing his feet ﬁsh came smelling and biting his toes he caught it and put it into his bag after which came second third and fourth which he caught and put in his bag likewise this done and dried his feet he put on his stockings and shoes and pursued his journey till he came to the palace where he knocked loudly with his crook he was sooner let in and having told his business but he was conducted to hall prepared that purpose where the king daughter sat ready to receive him and the better to lull his senses he was placed in rich easy chair having delicious wines his supper with many ﬁne dishes of fruit of which the shepherd ate and drank plentifully insomuch that he began to slumber before midnight shepherd said the lady i have caught you napping not zweet ally i was busy at what said she why feeshing nay shepherd there is in the hall matter vor that i have been feeshing says the lady where you ﬁsh quoth he in my bag have you catched one ay lady said he i willingly see it replied she ay please you you shall with all my heart this said he slyly drew 189 190 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https of the ﬁshes out of his bag at the sight of which she was greatly pleased and praised it pretty ﬁsh and withal said dear shepherd you think you could catch one in mine too ay ay doubtless i can then he fell to ﬁshing and in short time drew second ﬁsh out of the bag pretending he drew it from her the king daughter was so pleased with it that she kissed it declaring it was the ﬁnest she ever saw and about half an hour after she said shepherd you think you could get one more he answered mayhap i may when i have baited my hook then make haste i am impatient till i have another then the shepherd acted before and so presented her with another ﬁsh which she also extolled and praised saying it was ten times ﬁner than the other and then gave him leave to sleep promising to excuse him to her father in the morning the king came into the hall usual followed by the headsman with hatchet but the lady cried out you may return with your hatchet here is work you how so said the king has he neither slumbered nor slept royal father he has not how has he employed himself in ﬁshing why there is never where did he catch them one in his own bag and two in this one of mine say you so well friend dost thou think thou catch one in mine please you my liege i believe i can then directing the king to lie down he poked him with packing needle which made him cry out exceedingly at which time he drew the other ﬁsh out of the bag and showed it to the king his majesty said he never knew such sort of ﬁshing before however take my daughter according to my royal decree and so they were married and the wedding kept in great triumph and the shepherd became king son that was mighty well said the third boy he had wonderful good fortune this puts in mind of story which i will now tell in my turn t ale iii if i may believe my old grandmother there lived in the county of cumb erland nobleman who had three sons two of them were comely and tall youths wise and learned the third merry fool and went often in coat and steeple crowned hat at the top of which was tassel in this dress he made comical ﬁgure at this time the king of canterbury had ﬁne daughter adorned with all the gifts of nature joined to an ingenious education she being very appeared by her ready answers and the comical questions she put forth the king her father published decree that whoever should come to the court and answer his daughter three questions without study or stumbling should have her in marriage and also be heir to the crown at his decease on publishing this decree the said gentleman two sons agreed between themselves to go and try how favourable fortune might be to them in this undertaking but all their care was what they should with their silly brother jack they said if he follows us he will out with some foolish bolt and so spoil our business at length it was agreed on going to the court to go out of the back door which led to the road over several ﬁelds about mile from the house they did so but were sooner got into the highway but looking behind they saw their brother jack coming capering and dancing after them saying with loud laughter so you are going to get king daughter but i will pursue you they saw there was way to get rid of him but by walking fast and leaving him behind hoping thereby to get entrance before jack and then have the gates shut against him they had not gone half mile before jack set up great ﬁt of laughter at which one of his brothers said what the fool found out now why i found an egg put it in thy pocket said his brothers adad and so i will says jack presently after he was taken with another ﬁt of laughter what the fool found now what have i found says jack why crooked stick they bid him put that in his pocket also ay marry will i they had not walked much farther before jack burst into greater ﬁt of laughter than before his brothers said what the fool found now found why an orange put that in your pocket likewise i intend it says jack now by this time they were come near the palace gate at which they sooner knocked but they were admitted but jack never stood ceremonies but ran through the midst of the court and the wise brothers were making their addresses jack was laughing at the ladies 191 192 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https whom he said what troop of fair ladies are got here yes yes said the king daughter who was among them we are fair ladies we carry ﬁre in our bosom you said jack then roast an egg how will you get it out again by crooked stick which i have ay you will said she i have it in my pocket says jack in this jack answered the three questions proposed then he was preferred to that honour which was mentioned in the decree his two wise brothers then went home like two fools and left foolish jack to be reverenced at court with the king fair daughter said the fourth boy this veriﬁes the old proverb have fortune besides it has put in mind of story that was told by my aunt t ale iv long before arthur and the knights of the round table here reigned in the easterly part of this land king who kept his court at colchester he was witty strong and valiant by which means he subdued his enemies abroad and planted peace among his subjects at home nevertheless in the midst of all his earthly glory his queen died leaving behind her an only daughter about ﬁfteen years of age under the care of her royal husband this lady from her courtly carriage beauty and affability was the wonder of all that knew her but covetousness is the root of all evil so it happened here the king hearing of lady who had likewise an only daughter the sake of her riches had mind to marry her though she was old ugly and yet all could not deter him from marrying her the daughter of the said piece of deformity was yellow dowdy full of envy and and in short was much of the same mould her mother this signiﬁed nothing in few weeks the king attended by the nobility and gentry brought the said piece of deformity to his palace where the marriage rites were performed long they had not been in the court before they set the king against his own beautiful daughter which was done by false reports and accusations the young princess having lost her father love grew weary of the court and on certain day meeting with her father in the garden she desired him with tears in her eyes to give her small subsistence and she would go and seek her fortune to which the king consented and ordered her mother to make up small sum according to her discretion to her she went who gave her canvas bag of brown bread hard cheese with bottle of beer though this was but very pitiful dowry king daughter she took it returned thanks and so proceeded passing throu gh groves woods and valleys till at length she saw an old man sitting on stone at the mouth of cave who said good morning fair maiden whither away so fast aged father says she i am going to seek my fortune what hast thou in thy bag and bottle in my bag i have got bread and cheese and in my bottle good small beer will you please to partake of either yes said he with all my heart with that the lady pulled out her provision and bid him eat and welcome he did and gave her many thanks telling her there was thick thorny hedge before her which will appear to you impassable but take this wand in your hand strike three times and say pray hedge let come through and it will open immediately then little further you will ﬁnd well sit down on the brink of it and there will come up three golden heads which will speak and what they require that then promising she would she took her leave of him coming to the hedge and following the old man direction the hedge divided and gave her passage then coming to the well she had sooner sitten down but golden head came up with singing note wash comb lay down softly yes said the young lady then putting forth her hand with silver comb performed the ofﬁce placing it upon primrose bank then came up second and third saying the former which she complied with and then pulling out her provision ate her dinner then said the heads one to another what shall we this lady who hath used us so very kindly the ﬁrst said i will cause such addition to her beauty shall charm the most powerful prince in the world the second said i will endow her with such perfume both in body and breath shall far exceed the sweetest 193 194 195 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https the third said my gift shall be none of the least she is king daughter i make her so fortunate that she shall become queen to the greatest prince that reigns this done at their request she let them down into the well again and so proceeded on her journey she had not travelled long before she saw king hunting in the park with his nobles she would have shunned him but the king having sight of her made towards her and between her beauty and perfumed breath was so powerfully smitten that he was not able to subdue his passion but proceeded on his courtship where after some compliments and kind embra ces he gained her love and bringing her to his palace he caused her to be clothed in the most magniﬁcent manner this being ended and the king ﬁnding that she was the king of colchester daughter ordered some chariots to be got ready that he might pay him visit the chariot in which the king and queen rode was beautiﬁed with rich ornamental gems of gold the king her father was at ﬁrst astonished that his daughter had been so fortunate she was till the young king made him sensible of all that happened great was the joy at court among the nobility except the queen and her daughter who were ready to burst with malice and envied her happiness and the greater was their madness because she was now above them all great rejoicings with feasting and dancing continued many days then at length with the dowry that her father gave her they returned home well said the ﬁfth boy had she not been kind and beautiful such good fortune had never come to her lot and pray what became of her sister indeed i know not why then said the ﬁfth boy i can tell you something of her t ale she perceiving that her sister was so happy in seeking her fortune would needs the same so disclosing her mind to her mother all preparations were made not only rich apparel but sweetmeats sugar almonds in great quantities and large bottle of malaga sack thus furnished she went the same road her sister and coming near the cave there sat the old man who said young woman whither so fast what is that to you said she then said he what have you in your bag and bottle she answered good things what you shall not be troubled with wo you give some said he not bit nor drop unless it would choke you the old man frowned saying evil fortune attend thee going on she came to the hedge through which she espied gap where she thought to pass but going in the hedge closed and the thorns run into her ﬂesh so that with great difﬁculty she got out being now in bloody condition she looks water to wash herself and looking round she saw well and sitting down one of the heads came up to her saying wash comb lay down softly but she banged it with her bottle saying hang you take this your washing so the second and third heads came up and met with better welcome than the ﬁrst whereupon the heads consulted among themselves what evils to plague her with such usage the ﬁrst said let her be struck with leprosy in her face the second said let an additional stink be added to her breath the third bestowed on her husband though but poor country cobbler this done she goes on till she came to market town and it being market day the people smelt stink and seeing such mangy face all ﬂed but poor cobbler who not long before had mended the shoes of an old hermit who having money gave him box of ointment the cure of the leprosy and bottle of spirits stinkin g breath now the cobbler having mind to an act of charity was minded to try an experiment so going up to her asked her who she was i am said she the king of colchester daughter well said the cobbler if i restore you to your natural complexion and make sound cure both in face and breath will you in reward take husband yes friend replied she with all my heart with this the cobbler applied the remedies and they worked the effect in few weeks which being done they were married after some few days spent in town they set forward the court at colchester at length coming there and the queen understanding she had married nothing but poor cobbler fell into distraction and in wrath hanged herself the death of the quee n pleased the king much who was glad he had got rid of her so soon having buried her he gave 196 197 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https cobbler one hundred pounds on condition that he and his lady would quit the court the cobbler received it and promised he would then setting up his trade in remote part of the kingdom they lived many years he mending shoes and she spinning thread quoth the sixth boy i think king daughter she hath spun very ﬁne thread but now my story t ale vi tinker in our town had but one daughter whose name was tib and because her father would not let her marry miller man named jobson nothing would serve her but she must go and seek her fortune so over hills and mountains through groves and lonesome woods she passed till at length she met with an old woman who said unto tib where are you going to seek service says tib will you live with replied the old woman my family is small myself my cat and my dog tib answered with all my heart so home they went to her cottag which stood by the side of grove on the bank of pleasant river she sooner entered in at the door than she beheld the shelves furnished with abundance of earthen ware and glasses she had not lived long with her before tib had committed fault which the old woman was resolved to break every bone in her skin that end she put her into sack and having tied the mouth of the same she went to the grove to cut stick but while she was gone tib with penknife opened the sack and got out and put the dog and cat into it ﬁlling it up with pans pipkins then dragged it to the door that the old woman might not come in to miss them who on her return thinking that tib had rolled thither began to lay on like fury when the dog howled the cat mewed and the pipkins cracked while the old woman cries out ah howl if you will and be poxed before you come out of this sack i thrash your bones to chaff now tib stood at distance laughing to see how busy she was in destroying her own furniture then ﬂed it and never after returned it was well she did replied the seven th boy or else the old woman would certainly have been revenged on tib at last but now my story which shall be the last at this meeting t ale vii young man having found purse in which was ﬁve pounds he made proclamation that if anyone would lay any just claim to it to come to such tavern and they would have it again to the tavern he went where in meat and drink he spent crown at last when the young man was ready to go the owner came and demanded the purse which he was ready to surrender but the owner on knowing crown was spent would not receive it unless he made up the whole sum the young man told him he could not so an ofﬁcer was sent but before he came the youth took to his heels and ran it with that swiftness that an ass standing in his way he took hold of his tail to swing himself by and twitched it off little farther he overthrew woman with child and caused her to fall at length he was taken and brought before justice by the three sufferers having heard their complaints he turned to the young man and said young man several complaints are here laid against you which i shall clear up first keep the money you have found and trade with it till you have improved it so far to make him satisfaction and then let him have it you take the ass and work him till new tail grows then give him to his owner and you

all the riches and magniﬁcence she had gained by marriage they had been 231 232 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https from paying their wedding visit by their aversion to the blue beard of the bridegroom sooner were they arrived than they impatiently ran from room to room from cabinet to cabinet and then from wardrobe to wardrobe examining each with the

increased by the costly splendour of the hangings of the sofas the chairs carpets tables girandoles and the frames of which were silver gilt most richly ornamented and in which they saw themselves from head to foot in short nothing could exceed the magniﬁcence of what they saw and the visitors did not cease to extol and envy the good fortune of their friend who all this time was far from being amused by the ﬁne compliments they paid her so eagerly did she desire to see what was in the closet her husband had forbidden her to open so great indeed was her curiosity that without recollecting how uncivil it would be to leave her guests she descended private staircase that led to it and in such hurry that she was two or three times in danger of breaking her neck when she reached the door of the closet she stopped few moments to think of the charge her husband had given her and that he would not fail to keep his word in punishing her very severely should she disobey him but she was so very curious to know what was in the inside that she determined to venture in spite of everything she accordingly with trembling hand put the key into the lock and the door immediately opened the window shutters being closed she at ﬁrst saw nothing but in short time she perceived that the ﬂoor was covered with clotted blood on which the bodies of several dead women were lying these were all the wives whom blue beard had married and murdered one after another she was ready to sink with fear and the key of the closet door which she held in her hand fell on the ﬂoor when she had somewhat

remained the same before she next washed it but the blood did not stir at all she then scoured it with brickdust and afterwards with sand but notwithstanding all she could the blood was still there

journey before he was met by messenger who was coming to tell him that his business was happily concluded without his being present upon which his wife said everything she could think of to make him believe she was transported with joy at his unexpected return the next morning he asked her the keys she gave them to him but she could not help showing her fright blue beard easily guessed what had happened how is it said he that the key of the closet upon the ground ﬂoor is not here is it not then i must have left it on my said she and left the room in tears be sure you give it cried blue beard after going several times backwards and forwards pretending to look the key she was at last obliged to give it to blue beard he looked at it attentively and then said how came the blood upon the key i

almost dead with fear fell upon her knees asked his pardon thous and times her disobedience and entreated him to forgive all the time so very sorrowful and lovely that she would have melted any heart that was not harder than rock but blue beard answered madam you shall die this very minute alas said the poor trembling creature if i must die allow at least little time to say my prayers i give you

canter lads with their blue bonnets and young wenches carrying home their fairings in napkins muckle would hold their teeth going month there scarcely could be muckle love when there was so much the

gave smile when she passed she used to go to the well every night with her twa stoups to draw water after the manner of the israelites at gloaming so i thought of watching to give her the two apples which i had carried in my pouch more than week that purpose how she laughed when i stappit them into her hand and brushed by without speaking i stood at the bottom of the close listening and heard her laughing till she was like to split my heart ﬂap ﬂappit in my breast like pair of fanners it was moment of heavenly hope but i saw jamie coom the blacksmith who i aye jaloused was my rival coming down to the well i saw her give him one of the apples and hearing him say with loud gaffaw where is the tailor i took to my heels and never stopped till i found myself on the little stool by the ﬁreside

robust constitution was taken notice of by two fellows belonging to vessel in the harbour employed in the trade called is stealing young children from their parents and selling them slaves in plantations abroad being marked out by those monsters of impiety their prey i was cajoled on board the ship by them where i was sooner got than they conducted between the decks to some others they had kidnapped in the same manner at that time i had sense of the fate that was destined and spent the time in childish amusements with my ferers in the steerage being never suffered to go upon deck whilst the vessel lay in the harbour in about month time the ship set sail america i can not forget that when we arrived on the coast we were destined hard gale of wind sprung up from the and to the captain great surprise he not thinking he was near land although having been eleven weeks on the passage about twelve at night the ship struck on sandbank off cape may near the capes of delaware and to the great terror and affright of the ship company in short time was almost full of water the boat was then hoisted out into which the captain and his fellow villains the crew got with some difﬁculty leaving and my deluded companions to perish they then naturally concluded inevitable death to be our fate often in my distresses and miseries since have i wished that such had been the consequence when in state of innocence but providence thought proper to reserve future trials of its goodness thus abandoned and deserted without the least prospect of relief but threatened every moment with death did these villains leave us the cries the shrieks and tears of parcel of infants had effect on or caused the least remorse in the breasts of these merciless wretches scarce can i say to which to

in more brutal and butcherly manner yet it is to their enemies the sake of plunder and the rewards offered their principles are alike the love of sordid gain being both their motives the ship being on sandbank which did not give way to let her deeper we lay in the same deplorable condition until morning when though we saw the land of cape may at about mile distance we knew not what would be our fate the wind at length abated and the captain unwilling to lose all her cargo about ten sent some of his crew in boat to the ship side to bring us on shore where we lay in sort of camp made of the sails of the vessel and such other things we could 254 255 256 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https the provisions lasted us until we were taken in by vessel bound to philadelphia lying on this island well i can recollect near three weeks very little of the cargo was saved undamaged and the vessel was entirely lost when arrived and landed at philadelph ia the capital of pennsylvania the captain had people enough who came to buy us he sold us at about per head what became of my unhappy companions i never knew it was my lot to be sold to one of my countrymen whose name was hugh wilson north briton who had in his youth under gone the same fate myself having been kidnapped from johnstown in scotland happy was my lot in falling into my countryman power he was contrary to many others of his calling humane worthy honest man having children of his own and commiserating my unhappy condition he took great care of until i was ﬁt business and about the twelfth year of my age set about little triﬂes in which state i continued until my fourteenth year when i was more ﬁt harder work during such my idle state seeing my often reading and writing it incited in an inclination to learn which i intimated to my master telling him i should be very willing to serve year longer than the contract by which i was sold if he would indulge in going to school this he readily agreed to saying that winter would be the best time it being then summer i waited with impatience the other season but to make some progress in my design i got primer and learned much from my i could at school where i went every winter ﬁve years i made tolerable proﬁciency and have ever since been improving myself at leisure hours with this good master i continued till i was seventeen years old when he died and reward my faithful service he left currency which was then about sterling his best horse saddle and all his wearing apparel being now my own master having money in my pocket and all other necessaries i employed myself in jobbing about the country working any one that would employ near seven years when thinking i had money sufﬁcient to follow some better way of life i resolved to settle but thought one step necessary thereto was to be married which purpose i applied to the daug hter of substantial planter and found my suit was not unacceptable to her or her fathe r so that matters were soon concluded upon and we married my father in order to establish us in the world in an easy if not afﬂuent manner made deed of gift of tract of land that lay unhappily it has since proved on the frontiers of the province of pennsylvania near the forks of delaware in berks county containing about two hundred acres thirty of which were well cleared and ﬁt immediate use whereon was good house and barn the place pleasing well i settled on it though it cost the major part of my money in buying stock household furniture and implements work and happy i was in good wife yet did my felicity last not long about the year 1754 the indians in the french interest who had long time before ravaged and destroyed other parts of america unmolested i may very properly say began to be very troublesome on the frontiers of our province where they generally appeared in small skulking parties with yellings shoutings and antic postures instead of trumpets and drums committing great devastations the pennsylvanians little imagined at ﬁrst that the indians guilty of such outrages and violence were some of those who pretended to be in the english interest which alas proved to be too true to many of us like the french in europe without regard to faith or treaties they suddenly break out into furious rapid outrages and devastations but soon retire precipitately having stores nor provisions but what they meet with in their incursions some indeed carry bag with biscuit or indian corn therein but not unless they have long march to their destined place of action and those french who were sent to dispossess us in that part of the world being indefa tigable in their duty and continually contriving and using all manner of ways and means to win the indians to their interest many of whom had been too negligent and sometimes i may say cruelly treated by those who pretend to be their protectors and friends found it very difﬁcult matter to get over to their interest many who belonged to those nations in 257 258 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https with us especially the rewards they gave them were so great they paying every scalp of an english person sterling shocking to human nature were the barbarities daily committed by the savages and are not to be parallelled in all the volumes of history scarce did day pass but some unhappy family or other fell victims to savage cruelty terrible indeed it proved to well to many others i that was now happy in an easy state of life blessed with an affectionate and tender wife who was possessed of all amiable qualities to enable to go through the world with that peace and serenity of mind which every christian wishes to possess became on sudden one of the most unhappy and deplorable of mankind scarce can i sustain the shock which ever recoils on at thinking on the last time of seeing that good woman the fatal 2nd of october 1754 she that day went from home to visit some of her relations i stayed up later than usual expecting her return none being in the house besides myself how great was my surprise terror and affright when about eleven at night i heard the dismal or of the savages and to my inexpressible grief soon found my house was attacked by them i ﬂew to my chamber window and perceived them to be twelve in number they making several attempts to get in i asked them what they wanted they gave answer but continued beating and trying to get the door opened judge then the condition i must be in knowing the cruelty and merciless disposition of those savages should i fall into their hands to escape which dreadful misfortune having my gun loaded in my hand i threatened them with death if they should not desist but how vain and fruitless are the efforts of one man against the united force of so many and of such merciless undaunted and monsters i had here to deal with one of them that could speak little english threatened in return that if i did not come out they would burn alive in the house telling farther that they were friends to the english but if i would come out and surrender myself prisoner they would not kill my terror and distraction at hearing this is not to be expressed by words nor easily imagined by any person unless in the same condition little could i depend on the promises of such creatures and yet if i did not inevitable death by being burnt alive must be my lot distracted i was in such deplorable circumstances i chose to rely on the uncertainty of their fallacious promises rather than meet with certain death by rejecting them and accordingly went out of my house with my gun in my hand not knowing what i did or that i had it immediately on my approach they rushed on like so many tigers and instantly disarmed having thus in their power the merciless villains bound to tree near the door they then went into the house and plundered and destroyed everything carrying off what moveables they could the rest together with the house they set ﬁre to and consumed before my eyes the barbarians not satisﬁed with this set ﬁre to my barn stable and outhouses wherein were about two hundred bushels of wheat six cows four horses and ﬁve sheep which were entirely consumed to ashes during the conﬂagration to describe the thoughts the fears and misery that i felt is utterly impossible after this they untied and gave great load to carry on my back under which i travelled all that night with them full of the most terrible apprehensions and oppressed with the greatest anxiety of mind lest my unhappy wife should likewise have fallen prey to those cruel monsters at daybreak my infernal masters ordered to lay down my load when tying my hands again round tree with small cord they then forced the blood out of my ﬁnger they then kindled ﬁre near the tree whereto i was bound which ﬁlled with dreadful agonies concluding i was going to be made sacriﬁce to their barbarity the ﬁre being thus made they some time danced round after their manner with various odd motions and antic gestures whooping hallooing and crying in frightful manner it is their custom having satisﬁed themselves in this sort of their mirth they proceeded in more tragical manner taking the burning coals and sticks ﬂaming with ﬁre at the ends holding them near my face head hands and feet with deal of monstrous pleasure and satisfaction and at the same time threatening to burn entirely if i made the least noise or motion of my body thus tortured i was almost to death i suffered their brutal pleasure without being allowed to vent my inexpressible anguish 259 260 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https than by shedding tears even which when these inhuman tormentors observed with shocking pleasure and alacrity they would take fresh coals and apply near my eyes telling my face was wet and that they would dry it how i suffered these tortures i have here faintly described has been matter of wonder to many times but god enabled to wait with more than common patience deliverance i daily prayed having at length satisﬁed their brutal pleasure they sat round the ﬁre and roasted their meat of which they had robbed my dwelling when they had prepared it and satisﬁed their voracious appetites they offered some to though it is easily imagined i had but little appetite to eat after the tortures and miseries i had under gone yet was i forced to seem pleased with what they offered lest by refusing it they had again resumed their hellish practices what i could not eat i contrived to get between the bark and the tree where i was ﬁxed they having unbound my hands until they imagined i had ate all they gave but then they again bound before in which deplorable condit ion was i forced to continue all that day when the sun was set they put out the ﬁre and covered the ashes with leaves is their usual custom that the white people might not discover any traces or signs of their having been there going from thence along by the river the space of six miles loaded i was before we arrived at spot near the apalachian mountains where they hid their plunder under logs of wood and oh shocking to relate from thence did these hellish monster s proceed to neighbouring house occupied by one joseph suider and his unhappy consisting of his wife ﬁve children and young man his servant they soon got admittance into the unfortunate man house where they immediately without the least remorse and with more than brutal cruelty scalped the tender parents and the unhappy children nor could the tears the shrieks or cries of these unhappy victims prevent their horrid massacre having thus scalped them and plundered the house of everything that was moveable they set ﬁre to the same where the poor creatures met their ﬁnal doom amidst the ﬂames the hellish miscreants standing at the door or near the house the ﬂames would permit them rejoicing and echoing back in their diabolical manner the piercing cries groans and paternal and affectionate soothings which issued from this most horrid sacriﬁce of an innocent family not contented with what they had already done they still continued their inordinate villainy in making general conﬂagration of the barn and stables together with all the corn horses cows and everything on the place thinking the young man belonging to this unhappy family would be of some service to them in carrying part of their plunder they spared his life and loaded him and myself with what they had here got and again marched to the blue hills where they stowed their goods before my ferer could not long bear the cruel treatment which we were both obliged to suffer and complaining bitterly to of being unable to proceed any farther i endeavoured to condole him much lay in my power to bear up under his afﬂictions and wait with patience till by the divine assistance we should be delivered out of their clutches but in vain he still continued his moans and tears which one of the savages perceiving we travelled on instantly came up to us and with his tomahawk gave him blow on the head which felled the unhappy youth to the ground where they immediately scalped and left him the suddenness of this murder shocked to that degree that i was in manner like statue being quite motionless expecting my fate would soon be the same however recovering my distracted thoughts i dissembled the uneasiness and anguish which i felt well i could from the barbarians but such was the terror that i was under that some time i scarce knew the days of the week or what i did so that at this period life indeed became burden to and i regretted being saved from my ﬁrst persecutors the sailors the horrid fact being completed they kept on their course near the mountains where they lay skulking four or ﬁve days rejoicing at the plunder and store they had got when provisions became scarce they made their way towards susquehana where still to add to the many barbarities they had already committed passing near another house inhabited 261 262 263 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https an unhappy old man whose name was john adams with his wife and four small children and meeting with resistance they immediately scalped the unhappy wife and her four children before the good old man eyes inhuman and horrid this was it did not satiate them when they had murdered the poor woman they acted with her in such brutal manner decency or the remembrance of the crime will not permit to mention and this even before the unhappy husband who not being able to avoid the sight and incapable of affording her the least relief entreated them to put an end to his miserable being but they were deaf and regardless to the tears prayers and entreaties of this venerable sufferer they had been to those of the others and proceeded in their hellish purpose of burning and destroying his house barn cattle hay corn and everything the poor man few hours before was master of having saved what they thought proper from the ﬂames they gave the old man feeble weak and in the miserable condition he then was well myself burdens to carry and loading themselves likewise with bread and meat pursued their journey on towards the great swamp where being arrived they lay eight or nine days sometimes diverting themselves in exercising the most atrocious and barbarous cruelties on their unhappy victim the old man sometimes they would strip him naked and paint him all over with variou s sorts of colours which they extracted or made from herbs and roots at other times they would pluck the white hairs from his venerable beard and tauntingly tell him he was fool living so long and that they would show him kindness in putting him out of the world to all which the poor creature could but vent his sighs his tears his moans and entreaties that to my affrighted imagination were enough to penetrate heart of adamant and soften the most obdurate savage in vain alas were all his tears daily did they tire themselves with the various means they tried to torment tying him to tree and whipping him at others scorching his furrowed cheeks with coals and burning his legs quite to the knees but the good old man instead of repining or wickedly arraigning the divine justice like many others in such cases even in the greates t agonies incessantly offered up his prayers to the almighty with the most fervent thanksgivings his former mercies and hoping the ﬂames then surrounding and burning his aged limbs would soon send him to the blissful mansions of the just to be partaker of the blessings there and during such pious ejaculations his infernal plagues would come round him mimicking his groans and piteous wailings one night after he had thus been tormented whilst he and i were sitting together condoling each other at the misfortunes and miseries we daily suffered twenty scalps and three prison ers were brought in by another party of indians they had unhappily fallen into their hands in cannojigge small town near the river susquehana chieﬂy inhabited by the irish these prisoners gave us some shocking accounts of the murders and devastations committed in their parts the various and complicated actions of these barbarians would entirely ﬁll large volume but what i have already written with few other instances which i shall select from the information will enabl the reader to guess at the horrid treatment the english and indians in their interest suffered many years past i shall therefore only mention in brief manner those that suffered near the same time with myself this party who now joined us had it not i found in their power to begin their wickedness soon those who visited my habitation the ﬁrst of their tragedies being on the 25th day of october 1754 when john lewis with his wife and three small children fell sacriﬁces to their cruelty and were miserably scalped and murdered his house barn and everything he possessed being burnt and destroyed on the 28th jacob miller with his wife and six of his family together with everything on his plantation underwent the same fate the house mill barn twenty head of cattle two teams of horses and everything belonging to the unhappy geor ge folke met with the like wife and all his miserable family consisting of nine in number being inhumanly scalped then cut in pieces and given to the swine which devoured them i shall give another instance of the numberless and unheard of barbarities they related of the savages and proceed to their own tragical end in short one of the substantial traders belonging to the province having business that called him some miles up the country fell into the hands of these devils who not only scalped him but immediately roasted him before he was dead then like cannibals want of other food ate his whole body and of his head made what they called an indian pudding 264 265 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https these few instances of savage cruelty the deplorable situation of the defenceless inhabitants and what they hourly suffered in that part of the globe must strike the utmost terror to human soul and cause in every breast the utmost detestation not only against the authors of such tragic scenes but against

murders torments barbarities that can be exercised on the human sacriﬁces they get into their power are left untried or omitted the three prisoners that were brought with these additional forces constantly repining at their lot and almost dead with their excessive hard treatment contrived at last to make their escape but being far from their own settlements and not knowing the coun try were soon after met by some others of the tribes or nations at war with us and brought back to their diabolical masters who greatly rejoiced at having them again in their infernal power the poor creatures almost famished want of sustenance having had none during the time of their elopement were sooner in the clutches of the barbarians than two of them were tied to tree and great ﬁre made round them where they remained till they were terribly scorched and burnt when one of the villains with his scalping knife ripped open their bellies took out their entrails and burnt them before their eyes whilst the others were cutting piercing and tearing the ﬂesh from their breasts hands arms and legs with irons till they were dead the third unhappy victim was reserved few hours longer to be if possible sacriﬁced in more cruel manner his arms were tied close to his body and hole being dug deep enough him to stand upright he was put therein and earth rammed and beat in all round his body up to the neck so that his head only appeared above the ground they then scalped him and there let him remain three or four hours in the greatest agonies after which they made small ﬁre near his head causing him to suffer the most excruciating torments imaginable whilst the poor creature could only cry mercy in killing him immediately his brains were boiling in his head inexorable to all his plaints they continued the ﬁre whilst shocking to behold his eyes gushed out of their sockets and such agonizing torments did the unhappy creature suffer near two hours till he was quite dead they then cut off his head and buried it with the other bodies my task being to dig the graves which feeble and terriﬁed i was the dread of suffering the same fate enabled to i shall not here take up the reader time in vainly attempting to describe what i felt on such an occasion but continue my narrative more equal to my abilities great snow now falling the barbarians were little fearful lest the white people should by their traces ﬁnd out their skulking retreats which obliged them to make the best of their way to their winter quarters about two hundred miles farther from any plantation or inhabitants where after long and tedious journey being almost starved i arrived with this infernal crew the place where we were to rest in their tongue is called alamingo there were found number of wigwams full of their women and children dancing shooting and shouting were their general amusements and in all their festivals and dances they relate what successes they have had and what damages they have sustained in their expeditions in which i became part of their theme the severity of the cold increasing they stripped of my clothes their own use and gave such they usually wore themselves being piece of blanket pair of mogganes or shoes with yard of coarse cloth to put round instead of breeches to describe their dress and manner of living may not be altogether unacceptable to some of my readers but the size of this book will not permit to be so particular i might otherwise be i shall just observe that they in general wear white blanket which in they paint with various ﬁgures but particularly the leaves of trees in order to deceive their enemies when in the woods their mogganes are made of and the best sort have them bound round the edges with little beads and ribbands on their legs they wear pieces of blue cloth stockings some like our soldiers splatter they reach higher than their knees but not lower than their ancles they esteem them easy to run in breeches they never wear but instead thereof two pieces of linen one before and another behind the better sort have shirts of the ﬁnest linen they can get and to these some wear rufﬂes 266 267 268 the project

pull them off to wash but wear them till they fall to pieces they are very proud and take great delight in wearing trinkets such silver plates round their wrists and necks with several strings of wampum which is made of cotton interwoven with pebbles cockleshells down to their breasts and from their ears and noses they have rings or beads which hang dangling an inch or two the men have beards to prevent which they use certain instruments and tricks soon it begins to grow the hair of their heads is managed differently some pluck out and destroy all except lock hanging from the crown of the head which they interweave with wampum and feathers of various colours the women wear it very long twisted down their backs with beads feathers and wampum and on their heads most of them wear little coronets of brass or copper round their middle they wear blanket instead of petticoat the females are very chaste and constant to their husbands and if any young maiden should happen to have child before marriage she is never esteemed afterwards their food they get it chieﬂy by hunting and shooting and boil or roast all the meat they eat their standing dish consists of indian corn soaked then bruised and boiled their bread is likewise made of wild oats or sunﬂower seeds their gun tomahawk powder and shot they carry with them in time of war they in war decline open or skulking is their

fate and only spoiled the wealthy and proud or nobles and slothful bishops who lived in state on the fruit of the husbandman toil robin was born in the merry town of locksley in nottinghamshire his father was stout forester and kept the deer of king richard the 269 270 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https his mother was niece to the celebrated sir guy of

best marksman in the place c hapter ii robin pr ogress to nottingham being an account of his adventur es with the fifteen foresters robin hood was now about ﬁfteen years old in person tall and stout and of good countenance in courage and strength few equalled him one day he determined to take journey to nottingham hearing that the king had appointed shooting matc h in that town to be disputed by the best archers when he came thither he happened to fall into company with ﬁfteen stout foresters who sat drinking and laughing together what news what news said bold robin hood that you drink and talk so merrily the foresters who despised him on account of his youth answered roughly we are come to win the king prize which we are resolved to carry off in spite of all opposition and will not be questioned by boys i have good bow the best said robin hood and will contest the prize with you we hold thee and thy bow in scorn said they shall stripling like thee bear bow before the king archers that is not able to draw the string i lay bet of twenty crowns said robin that i win the king prize and hit the mark at hundred yards distance doubt not i make the wager good or believe bold robin hood the mark was running hart let loose the purpose and when the other bowmen had tried their skill robin took his bow and his arrows and taking good aim fairly hit the mark at hundred yards distance the multitude shouted and hailed the young victor with joy the prize is mine said robin hood i claim it the wager too is mine give it the prize is none of thine said the ﬁfteen foresters and the wager shall be none of thine take up thy bow insolent boy and begone or we will break thy bones robin hood full of rage cried out you said i was archer but you have found one and you now deny my reward he then took up his bow and departed but having learnt which way the fores ters must take at their return home he repaired to the place where he had left his merry men and consulting together they resolved to lie in ambush in the road after while they saw the foresters approaching shouting and singing because they had brought off the king prize but when robin hood and his men presented themselves in battle array their mirth was quickly changed into terror and amazement at ﬁrst they made show of resistance but ﬁnding the number of their adversaries to be more than treble their own they threw down their arms and begged mercy you said i was archer cried robin hood now say so again and let him that chooses it ﬂy his life and see if my arrows can overtake him we beg mercy cried the foresters lo here is the prize that you won and the wager of twenty crowns well said robin you submit quietly i will grant you your lives but you shall not escape without some reward your deeds he and his men then stripped them of their clothes leaving them covering but their trousers and having cut off their hair and their ears daubed their faces with mixture of yellow and red afterwards they bound their hands and tied large pair of antlers on each of their heads and in this most ridiculous state drove them back into the town telling them if they offered to return they should not escape with their lives soon they entered the streets the whole place was in an uproar and what with the barking of 271 272 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https dogs

meeting and how their acquaintance and friendship began with their merry reception in sherwood bower when bold robin hood was about twenty years old he happened to meet with jolly stranger whom he afterwards called little john this man though called little was lusty young blade his limbs were large and his person seven feet high wherever he went people quaked at his name and he made all his enemies to ﬂy before him was thus their acquaintance began robin and his men had built in sherwo od forest strong and secret bower so artfully contrived and hidden among the woods that none but themselves could ever ﬁnd them out and to which they retreated in cases of need here robin once continued fourteen days with his merry bowmen and then he said to t arry while in this grove my brave men we have had sport these many long days therefore i will wander abroad short way to seek some amusem ent but you be attentive and hear whenever i blow an alarm with my loud bugle horn by this means i will let you know if i want your assistance after he had strayed some time near brook he espied tall and lusty stranger coming towards him they happened to meet on long narrow wooden bridge and neither of them would give way to let the other pass robin hood at length being enraged drew an arrow from his quiver and threatened to shoot at the stranger breast you dare not said the other if you offer to touch the string i beat out your teeth and tumble you into the brook you see i have nothing but staff in my hand and none but coward would offer to ﬁght with weapons so different the name of coward said robin i scorn i will therefore lay aside my bow and arrows and take stout staff to prove thy manhood the stranger accepted the challenge and the sport was quickly begun at ﬁrst robin gave the man such stroke that it made his sides ring the other said i must pay you this friend and give you good you send long i am able to handle staff i scorn to die in your debt he then gave robin so hearty knock on the crown that the blood ran trickling down to his ears robin now engaged more ﬁercely and laid on his blows so thick and fast that he made his adversary coat smoke if it had been on ﬁre but the stranger waxing most furious and strong at length gave robin such terrible that it quite beat him down and tumbled him into the brook then in laughter he called out to his fallen foe prithee where art thou now my good fellow why faith said robin i swim with the tide every man should he now swam along to the bank and pulled himself out by thorn and then said to the conqueror thou

before she hated and faustus desire was this he gave him an enchanted ring which he ordered him to put into the lady hand or to slip it on her ﬁnger which he did and sooner had she got the ring than

sent some doctors and master bachelors of arts and other students to take dinner with him whom he provided great store of varieties with music and the like but all would not keep up his spirits the hour drew near whereupon his countenance changing the doctors and masters of arts inquired of him the reasons of his melancholiness to which faustus answered my friends you have known these many years and how i have practised all manner of wickedness i have been great conjurer which devilish art i obtained of the devil and also to obtain power to whatever i pleased i sold myself to the devil years

concealing it so long telling him if he had made them acquainted before that they thought it might have been prevented he told them he had desire several times to have disclosed this intrigue but the devil told him that if he did he would presently fetch him away he also told them he had desire to join with the godly and to leave off that wicked course but immediately the devil used to come and torment him etc but now saith faustus it is but in vain to talk of what i did intend i have sold myself to the devil body and soul is his sooner had he spoken these words but suddenly it fell thundering and lightning the like was never heard whereupon faustus went into the great hall the doctors and masters staying in the next room intending to hear his end about twelve the house shook so terribly that they thought it would have been down upon them and suddenly the house windows were broken to pieces so that they trembled and wished themselves elsewhere whereupon great clap of thunder with whirlwind the doors ﬂew open and mighty rushing of wind entered with the hissing of serpents shrieks and cries upon which he lamentably cried out murder and there was such roaring in the hall if all the devils in hell had been there when daylight appeared they took the boldness to enter into the room and found his brains beaten out against the wall and the ﬂoor sprinkled with blood but

desirous of learning which to admiration he took so fast that his schoolmas ter could teach him further and being about to send him home with commendations to his father he fearing the worst humbly besought him to prevail if possible with his father that he might be sent to the university where he had desire to go and learn the liberal sciences his schoolmaster denied him not his request but went home with him and taking the old man aside told him he had learned his son far he was able that he took it in extremely well and was willing to improve it at the university and that he was verily persuaded by the promptness he perceived in him if he would be at little charge with him there he would be so great proﬁcient would advance him to an eminent station the old man heard this with some

oxford to study at their charge where he soon grew such proﬁcient that his fame soon spread not only in the university but also over all england and came to the ears of king edward the third who then reigned and he taking progress with his queen and nobles was desirous to see him and have an experiment of his art so that being at nobleman house within four miles of the city of oxford he sent gentleman of his bedchamber to desire him to come to him the knight delayed not the message and ﬁnding him at his study did his errand the friar told him he would be with his majesty and bid him make haste or he should be there before him at this he smiled being well mounted saying scholars and travellers might lie by authority well said friar bacon to convince you i will not only be there before you ride fast you can but i will there show you the you lay with last though she is now busy dressing the dinner at sir william belton hundred miles distance from this place well said the gentleman of

that he knew not which way to go and missing the way he turned down and rode over hedge and ditch backwards and forwards till the charm was dissolved when the friar came into the king presence he did him obeisance and was kindly welcomed by him then said the king worthy bacon having heard much of your fame the cause of my sending you was to be spectator of some ﬁne curiosities in your art the friar excused at ﬁrst but the king pressing it promised on his royal word harm should come to him he bid all keep silence and waving his magic wand there presently to their great amazement ensued the most melodious music they had ever heard which continued very ravishing nearly half an hour then waving his wand another kind of music was heard and presently dancers in antic shapes at masquerade entered the room and having danced incomparably well they vanished waving his wand the third time louder music was heard and whilst that played table was placed by an invisible hand richly spread with all the dainties that could be thought of then he desired the king and queen to draw their seats near and partake of the repast he had prepared their highnesses which after they had done all vanished he waved the fourth time and thereupon the place was perfumed with all the sweets of arabia or that the whole world could produce then waving the ﬁfth time there came in russians persians and polanders dressed in the ﬁnest soft fur silks and downs of rare fowls that are to be found in the universe which he bid them feel and then the strangers having danced after their own country fashion

pressed on him jewel of great value commanding him to wear it mark of his favour whilst this was doing the gentleman of the bedchamber came in pufﬁng and blowing all bemired and dirty and his face and hands scratched with the bushes and briars the king at this sight demanded why he stayed so long and how he came in that condition oh plague said he take friar bacon and all his devils they have led

both amazement and laughter though the gentleman was much ashamed and confounded to be thus exposed still muttering revenge but friar bacon told him his best way was to put up all since he had veriﬁed all his promises and bid him have care how he gave scholar the lie again the king and queen well pleased with the entertainment highly commending his art and promising him their favour and protection

those of the order often fasted on set days miles loved his guts too well to pinch them and though outwardly he seemed to fast compliance he always kept private reserve to eat in corner which bacon knew by art and resolved to put trick upon him it so happened on good friday in lent strict fast was held and miles seemed very devout when his master bid him however take bit of bread and sip of wine early in the morning to keep him from fainting he refused it saying he was great sinner and therefore ought to more than this his mortiﬁcation and to gain absolution making great many pretences of sanctity and how well he was inclined to keep the holy fast is well said the friar if i catch you not tripping hereupon miles went to his cell pretending to pray but indeed to eat ﬁne pudding he had concealed which he had sooner put into his mouth at one end but it stuck there he could neither eat it nor get it out the use of his hands failed and he was taken with shivering all over so that thinking he should have died presently he cried piteously out help whereupon friar bacon calling the scholars together went in to see what was the matter and perceiving him in that plight said smiling now i see what penitent servant i have who was so conscientious he would not touch bit of bread but would willingly have devoured two pounds of pudding to have broke his fast he piteously entreated him to dissolve the charm and deliver him and he would never so again nay said the friar you shall penance this so taking hold of the end of the pudding he led him out to the scholars saying see here fellow that would not touch bit of bread when they saw him in this plight they all fell heartily but friar bacon not so contented led him to the college gate and by enchantment ﬁxing the end of the pudding to the bar he was made so fast to it if it had been by cable rope and on his back were placed these lines this is friar bacon man who vow to fast but dissembling thus it took at last the pudding more religion had than he though he would eat it it will not down you see then of hypocrisy pray all beware lest like disgrace be each dissembler share miles all the while was jeered and sported with by all the scholars and town people but after four hour penance his master dissolved the charm and released him and he ever after kept the fasts not so much out of religion fear that

who told him he was now come to demand him and he must now go along with him to his knowledge he had paid his debts and done whatever was agreed to the gentleman wondering how he should know this so soon denied it nay replied he ﬁerce ly deny it not i not be cheated of my bargain and thereupon changed into horrible shape struck him almost dead with fear now he perceived it was the devil then he told him if he did not meet on the morrow in the same place he had lent him the money he would come the next day and tear him to pieces and says he if i prove not what i say you shall be quiet and so vanished out of the window in ﬂash of ﬂame with horrible bellowings the gentleman seeing himself in this case began to weep bitterly and wished he had been contented in his sad condition rather than have taken such desperate way to enrich himself and was almost at his wits end friar bacon knowing by his art what had passed came to comfort him and having heard the whole story bid him not despair but pray and repent of his sins and he would contrive to show the devil trick that should release him from his obligation this greatly comforted the gentleman and he prom ised to whatever the friar should order him then says he meet at the time appointed and i will be near offer to put the decision of the controversy to the next that comes by and that shall be myself and i will ﬁnd 316 317 318 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https infallibly to give it on your side accordingly he met and the devil consented to put it to arbitration then friar bacon appearing lo said the gentleman here proper judge this learned friar shall determine it and if it goes against you have free liberty to with you please content said the devil then each of them told their story and the writing was produced with all the acquittances he had taken the devil contrary to his knowledge had stolen them and the other writings belonging to his estate out of his closet the friar weighing well the matter asked the gentleman wheth er he had paid the devil any of the money he borrowed of him replied he not one farthing why then said he devil his debts are not dischar ged you are his principal creditor and according to this writing can lay claim to him till every one of his debts are dischar ged how how replied the devil am i outwitted then friar thou art crafty knave and thereupon vanished in ﬂame raising mighty tempest of thunder lightning and rain so that they were wet through before they could get shelter then bacon charged him he should never pay the devil farthing of his debt whatever shape he came in or artiﬁce he used to wheedle him out of it and then he could have power over him the gentleman on this living temperate frugal life grew very rich and leaving children at his death bequeathed his estate to brazen nose college because friar bacon member of it had delivered him from so great danger of body and soul c hapter iv how friar bacon framed brazen head which by enchantment was to speak by that means all england had been walled with brass if the folly of his man miles who was set to watch the head had not disappointed it not timely calling his master to answer it which he was struck dumb many days friar bacon being now profound proﬁcient in the art of magic and many other sciences contrived with one friar bungey who was his pupil to something memorable the good of his country and many things they cast in their minds at last they remembered that england had often been harassed and invaded by the romans saxons danes normans and other nations at sundry times to the great effusion of blood and often alteration of the constitution of governments and if anything might be contrived to prevent the like the future they should thereby raise lasting monument to their names bacon upon this concluded to frame head of brass and if by their art they could cause it to speak and answer their demands they required that all the shores of england and wales should be walled with brass and brazen towers be raised on the frontiers of scotland to hinder the incursions and rovings of the hardy scots they laboured to this by art but could not so they conjured up spirit to inquire of the infernal council whether it might be done or not the spirit however was unwilling to answer till friar bacon threatened with his charms to bind him in chains in the red sea or to burning rock and make him the sport of wrecking whirlwinds terriﬁed by this means he said of himself he could give answer but must inquire of his lord lucifer they granted him two days an answer accordingly he returned this if they two months would carefully watch the head it should in that time speak but the certain time should not be known to them and then if they did hear it they should be answered at this they much rejoiced and watched by turns very carefully six weeks and voice was uttered at length tired out and broken want of their natural rest they concluded some other might watch well they till they refreshed themselves in repose and call them when the head began to speak which would be time enough and because this was secret they did not care having it known till they saw what they should make of it bacon thereupon proposed his man miles and bungey approved of it so they called miles told him the nature of the brazen head and what was intended by giving him strict char ge on his life to awake them soon ever he heard it speak 319 320 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https that master said he let alone i warrant you i your business effectually never fear it so he got him long sword by his side and tabor and pipe to play and keep him awake if any drowsiness or the like should overtake him the charge being given and he thus accoutred the two friars went to rest in the next apartment miles then began to pipe and sing songs of his sweethearts and frolics bessy that is so frolic and gay like cat she loves with her tail to play though sometimes she pant and frown all well when her anger goes down she never say nay but sport and play bessy to is the queen of the may mar gery she is peevish and proud come ﬁddlers then and scrape the crowd whilst his merriment passed after hoarse noise like thunder almost spent the head spoke distinctly time i oh ho says miles is this all the news you can tell well copper nose has my master taken all this pains about you and you can speak wiser dost thou think i am such fool to break his sweet slum this speak wiser or he shall sleep on time is quotha why i know time is and that thou shalt hear goodman kettle jaws time is some to gain time is some to lose time is some to hand but then they can not choose time is to go score time is when one should pay time is to reckon too but few care that day time is to graft the born upon another head time is to make maids hearts swell oh then is time they thou this goodman copper nose we scholars know when time is without thy babbling we know when time is to drink good sack eat well kiss our hostesses and run on the score but when time is to pay them is indeed but seldom while thus he merrily discoursed about half an hour after the same noise began before and the head said time was well said miles this blockish head is the foolishest thing my wise master ever troubled himself about how would he have laughed had he been here to hear it prat so simply therefore thou aced ass speak wiser or i shall never trouble my head to awake him time was quotha thou ass thou i know that and so thou shalt hear i ﬁnd my master has watched and tutored thee to ﬁne purpose time was when thou kettle was wont to hold good matter but friar bacon did thee spoil when he thy sides did batter time was when conscience dwelt with men of each vocation time was when lawyers did not thrive 321 322 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https so well by men vexations time was when charity was not denied being time was when ofﬁce kept knaves that time was worth the seeing ay ay and time was many other things but what of that goodman brazen face i see my master has placed here on very foolish account i think i good go to sleep too to stay watching here to purpose whilst he thus scoffed and taunted the head spoke third time and said time is past and so with horrid noise fell down and broke to pieces whereupon ensued lamentable shrieks and cries ﬂashes of ﬁre and rattling of thunder which awaking the two friars they came running in in great disorder found miles rolling on the ﬂoor in stinking pickle almost dead with fear and the head lying shattered about the room in thousand pieces then having brought him to his senses again they demanded how this came nay the devil knows better than i said miles i believe he was in this plaguy head when it fell it gave bounce like cannon wretch that thou art said bacon triﬂe not with my impatience didst thou hear it speak varlet answer that why truly said miles it did speak but very simply considering you have been so long it i protest i could have taught jackdaw to have spoke better in two days it said is oh villain says bacon thou called then all england had been walled with brass to my immortal fame then continued miles about half an hour after it said was wretch how my anger burns against thee had you but called then it might have done what i desired then said he it said s past and so fell down with the horrid noise that waked you and made i am sure befoul my breeches and since here so much to about time i think it time to retire and clean myself well villain says bacon thou has lost all our cost and pains by thy foolish negligence why said miles i thought it would not have stopped when it once began but would have gone on and told some pleasant story or have commanded to have called you and i should have done it but i see the devil is cunning sophister and all hell would not allow him tinkers and brass enough to the work and therefore has put this trick upon us to get oft from his promise how slave said the friar art thou at buffoonery now thou hast done this great injury sirrah because you think the head spake not enough to induce you to call us you shall speak less in two months space and with that by enchantment he struck him dumb to the end of that time and would have done worse had not bungey had compassion on the fellow simplicity and persuaded him from it and thus ends the history of that famous friar bacon who had done deed which would have made his fame ring through all ages yet to come had it not been the simplicity of his man miles the hist or y of the blind beggar of bethnal green containing 323 324 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by

worthy of note c hapter how monfor d went to the w ars of france wher he lost his sight how he was accompanied with his w ife who pr eserved his life and of his return to england etc in former days when the rose of engla nd eclipsed the lilies of france and true english valour made that nation stoop among other brave gallants that went over to try their fortune monford was one person well descended who being naturally inclined to war and greedy of fame neither the entreaty of friends nor the marriage he had contracted with kind beautiful woman could alter his purpose but taking his wife margaret with him he with many hundreds more crossed the seas and with the help of prosperous wind arriving at calais marched to the royal standard accompanied with his lovin g wife who in manlike attire became his inseparable companion and was the cause of saving his life many skirmishes happened between the english and french wherein young monford behaved himself with wondrous courage and in one following too hot the pursuit was with divers others entrapped into ambush late in the evening and though he manfully disputed it makin g great slaughter of the enemy yet in spite of resistance he was beaten from his horse by forcible stroke and left in the ﬁeld dead among the dying men where he had undoubtedly perished through loss of blood and the anguish of his wounds had not

he had lost his sight but true love worki ng in her heart the alteration or disﬁgurement of his countenance did not alter her affection but comforting him in the best manner she could though his natural courage would not admit of any dejection she procured him homely suit of apparel and brought him unﬁt service back to england of whose entertainment and settlement at bethnal green in the county of middlesex and course of life you shall hear in the following chapter c hapter ii how monfor d arrived in england and of the cold entertainment he found among his relations how he settled in bethnal gr een wher he continued to beg his living monford having escaped dreadful storm at sea landed with his wife on the coast of essex where he had some considerable relations to whom in his necessity they applied themselves succour but they who after the death of his parents had wasted much of his patrimony or fearing he might be chargeable to them would not know him and those that were convinced he was the same monford that went over to france gave him but cold entertainment insomuch that scorning to rely upon their charity he told his wife that he intended early in the morning to haste towards london and that he would rather trust to providence than the ingratitude of those who in his prosperous days had caressed him his wife declared she would labour at her or what she was capable living in two days travelling they spent what little money they had saved so necessity obliged them to ask charity of the people he passed through the country towns and villages who understanding that he came by his misfortune in ﬁghting the honour of his country gave liberally to him and considering that the loss 325 326 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https his sight had rendered him incapable of business he resolved to embrace what providence had cast in his way which was to live upon charity whereupon arriving at bethnal green near london he hired small cottage his wife and himself and daily appearing publicly to crave alms was from thence called the beggar of bethnal green and in short time found it thriving trade insomuch that his bed of straw was changed into down and his earthen platters and other utensils into better sort of decent furniture c hapter iii how monfor d happened to meet with snap an old experienced beggar who gave him an insight into the mystery of the canting t ribe and how he invited him to the rendezvous monford resolving in this kind of way to spend the remainder of his days being very well contented with his trade having played it with great success in the place where he lived one day he was encountered by an old proﬁcient in the art of begging who seeing him very diligent did greatly covet his acquaintance and to know what gang he did belong to he therefore accosts him in their canting method which is sort of speech or rather gibberish peculiar to themselves monford being ignorant could make him direct answer which the other whose name was snap perceiving and thereby knowing him to be young beginner invited him to their feasts or rendezvous in whitechapel whither he having promised to come and they between them tripped off four black pots of rum they parted that time c hapter iv how monfor d went to the beggars feast and of his entertainment and also the presents they made monford upon his coming home declared to his wife what merry companion he met with and what discourse he had and likewise what he had promised entreating her to get things in readiness that she might conduct him thither where appeared instead of ragged regiment of lame blind and dumb there was rout of jovial dancers gay the spring and merry the maids which made them imagine they were mistaken in the place or was imposed upon and therefore turned to go away had not snap started from his chair where he sat supervisor in all his gallantry and taking him by the hand let him know who it was introduced him into the assembly where he was received brother of their society every member saluting him with compliment and that he might not want guide the future snap in the name of the society presented him with dog and bell trained to the business so his wife and he being splendidly entertained were dismissed upon his promise that he would not be absent at their yearly meeting c hapter what success he had in the begging t rade how his w ife was br ought to bed of daughter and christened by the name of elizabeth the blind beggar soon became master of his trade and by the help of his dog trudged often to london and having the perfect tone had the luck to return with his pockets well lined with chink his way of begging became so pleasing to him that he would often sing

wife fell in labour and was delivered of daughter whose birth made him think he was the happiest man alive and hundred times he kissed her and dandled her in his arms whom he christened by the name of elizabeth and she increased in years so her beauty and modesty caused her to be called pretty betty some began to dote upon her admirable perfections and the better to qualify her gave her such learning was suitable to her degree which she improved so that her beauty and wit her skill in singing dancing and playing on instruments of music procured her the envy of the young maidens thereabouts who supposed themselves much superior in birth and fortune would often reﬂect upon her birth and call her beggar brat she bore all their ill language without returning it and endeavoured to win them to her by gentle persuasions but not prevailing and her patience spent she said i never injured any of you but have strove to you all the good ofﬁces which i was capable of doing why then you envy and abuse what if my parents are in mean station yet they pay my education of dancing and singing which they bestow upon and though perhaps i am not so well descended some of you though you may be mistaken yet heaven might have made your case the same had it thought ﬁt yet ﬁnding that they did not cease to rail at her and being by this time about ﬁfteen years of age she prevailed with her parents to grant her leave to seek her fortune c hapter vi how handsome betty took leave of her par ents and the entertainment she met with now the time of betty departure being come her parents furnished her with clothes and other necessaries whereupon she fell upon her knees and craved their blessing which being given with many prayers her prosperity they took sad farewell pretty betty having now left her father house or rather went pensive along the road towards stradford relying only on providence to direct her having walked all night at sunrise she came to rumford in essex and being ready to faint betook herself to an inn and called something to refresh her the mistress of the house taking notice of her garb beautiful face and modest behaviour though dejected began to ask her from whence she came and whither she was bound betty replied i am going to seek my fortune i am very well educated by my indulgent parents who live near london but i am now obliged contrary to my former expectation to get my livelihood in some honest way of working the good woman being more and more taken with her carriage demanded if she would be content to stay with her till she could better provide to her advantage and that she would use her daughter rather than servant betty thankfully accepted the offer and in the performance of whatever she undertook dischar ged herself so well that she gained the love and applause of all that observed her insomuch that her name beauty and ingenuity began to spread and abundance of young men resorted to the house which created great trade on purpose to see her who generally took liking to her nature had made her so lovely and charming that she could not but be admired insomuch that many of them they found opportunity began to buzz love stories in her ears to which she gave but little heed till four suitors of greater worth beat off these little assailants and laid close siege in the following chapter will appear c hapter vii how pr etty betty living at an inn at rumfor d was courted by persons of fortune 329 330 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https being whispered about that pretty betty must needs be some great person daughter it highly increased her reputation at last the son very rich london merchant courted her but she modestly declined his offers also the offers of all other suitors by representing to them the inequality of her fortune to theirs but this served only to increase their passions and being every day importuned she at last resolved to discover who her parents were judging that way to be the most sure means to try the sincerity of their love and af fection which they pretended to have her c hapter viii how pr etty betty being w oo by her master son mer chant gentleman and knight how upon her declaring her par entage was slighted by all but the knight and of their agreement our beautiful virgin being hardly pressed love and enjoyment found herself obliged to take course that might rid her of her lovers or allot one of them to her share wherefore she told them she was not really at her own disposal her parents being alive therefore if they loved her they said and seeing but one could enjoy her she was contented her father should choose one her of whose choice she would approve this set them almost at daggers drawing who should get thither ﬁrst but whither to go they knew not therefore desired to be informed every one heart being ﬁlled with joy not doubting to carry the prize when thus she began my parents worthy sirs live on bethnal green my father is left with dog and bell living upon the charity of good people and my mother poor woman that spins bread thus i have declared to you my parents and though i might have the richest person in the world husband yet i would not marry him without their consent which i think myself bound in duty to obtain most of her suitors seemed thunderstruck at this plain declaration every one except the knight despising her now much they seemed to love her before each of them swearing they would not undervalue themselves to marry beggar child but the knight was more inﬂamed than ever and having large estate did not regard interest or portion so much he did the pleasing of his fancy with beautiful modest young and virtuous maid all of which centred in pretty betty therefore after he had paused while took the blushing virgin by the hand and said you see fair creature how they that pretended to love you did it only in expectation of your being descended from wealthy parents and that they might get large portion though they have left you if you will accept of husband who truly love you on account of your virtue and beauty i will make you my wife and settle on you jointure to this she replied alas sir i dare not hope so much happiness or if i durst yet would not dispose of myself without my parents consent though i must confess says she blushing i ever did esteem you above all the gentlemen who did make love and offer themselves to this modesty kindled his passion more and therefore after many vows of constancy it was agreed that he should provide horses and servants and conduct her the next morning to bethnal green to ask and obtain her father consent yet this affair was not so secretly managed but spies being abroad soon discovered it who not only discovered to the knight uncle who was guardian and trustee him and had the sole care of his estate but to most of the young men in rumford who were her admirers the following chapter will inform you c hapter ix how pr etty betty rid behind the knight to her father house and what happened on the road also what happened between the knight uncle and betty father pretty betty having met the knight according to appointment did not scrup le to ride behind him but they had scarce got out of town when his uncle came to the inn but not 331 332 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https either of them there was conﬁrmed that what had been told him was true and therefore he followed them to prevent the match being accompanied with several of betty lovers who suspected the knight had taken her away by force their hurry and confusion was great and the townsmen going nearer way overtook and fell foul upon the knight and his servants without giving him leave to speak himself or suffering his mistress to excuse him so that sharp conﬂict ensued till at length divers persons that were travelling the road came and parted them whereby they came to right understanding which made those that had misused him beg his pardon which he granted and dismissing them kept on his way till coming to the old man door they alighted which made him upon hearing the noise of horses trampling being thing very unusual start from the ﬁre and put his head out of the window and not understanding the meaning of it ere the knight uncle came pufﬁng and blowing at strange rate crying why how now nephew what this i hear of you are you mad to disgrace your family by marrying beggar brat shame shame consider better than to make yourself laughing stock to the world by such an unseemly match then turning about to pretty betty said pray how came this about you baggage you but however i say nephew leave her and come along with and i will provide rich wife you suitable to your condition to this the young knight would have replied but the blind beggar monford not being able to bear his taunts and reproaches any longer said i can not see you at all but sir whatever you are i hear you too much and more than becomes civil gentleman nor i count my girl so mean to suffer her to be railed on at my door therefore pray sir hold your prating or i shall fell you with my staff i have seen the day when taller fellow than you durst not put in passion if your kinsman does not think my child ﬁt match him let him let her alone and welcome i am satisﬁed she hath her share of beauty and good breeding and those are enough to recommend her but know sir that i her father am willing and ready to lay down many guineas my child you are to drop your nephew and therefore care not how soon you begin the knight uncle was something surprised at this speech of the blind beggar but however he accepted of the challenge and sent to london bag of gold soon it was brought monford pulled out two large cat skins stuffed with gold from under bundle of rags whereby it appeared his trade had been advantageous both parties being ready they rained golden shower so plentifully that the gentleman stock failed him and the beggar not hearing it chink fell into laughter and said how sir is your money done so soon i thought at ﬁrst you had more words than money pray your credit sake try your friends i have three or four cat skins with golden puddings in their bellies yet indeed said the gentleman i am content to own you have outdone and think you have the philosopher stone or keep familiar to bring it to you from the golden mountain but seeing the world goes so well with you i shall further go about to persuade my nephew from being your but beg pardon what i have done oh you so said the beggar then may things be better perhaps than you expect then turning to the knight gather up said he the loose coin i have scattered and here cat skin ﬁlled which will make up the sum of three thousand pounds beside hundred more to buy her wedding gown take this her present portion and you behave yourself expect more hereafter i give her to you and with her blessing go to churc h and

all were silent begun to relate ﬁrst his marriage second his going over to france accompanied by his beloved spouse his adventures there and lastly how he lost his sight in an engagement with his

being willing he should be able to live in the world another day bound him an apprentice to saddler one who ﬁtted poor robin s humour to hair the master loving drink he thought it should go hard if the man likewise did not also wet his lips with it it fortuned one time his master had brewed barrel of beer stronger than ordinary to the drinking of which poor robin one night invites ﬁve or six of his comrades who before the next morning drank it all up poor robin to excuse himself draws the spiggot out and throws pailful of small beer and two or three pails full of water under the tap and by wile gets great sow into the cellar so the next morning when his master arose all was quiet and the sow was blamed what the boar pig had done c hapter ii how poor robin served his master sitting up

asleep in chair during which time his man must not go to bed but wait until his master awakened poor robin to break him of this evil custom one night when his master came home soundly fuddled and falling asleep in his chair usual so he made great ﬁre and then drew his master legs so near thereto that his toes touched some of the coals which being done he sits him down in the other corner to observe the sequel he had not sat long till his master shoes began to fry whereupon he suddenly awakes and jumps about if he had been mad the man all the while counterfeits himself asleep and seemed

inconvenient him to live alone and that two heads were better than one he resolved to many others did marry in haste though he should repent at leisure but his fortune was better than his deserts though she was but homely woman with whom he joined in matrimony yet she was provident to live in the world and his own part he stood not much on beauty but had rather have fat purse than fair wife

other military weapons of destruction they brought drake which they planted under poor robin chamber to be shot off at nine at night warning all people to repair home poor robi n and his wife were at that time newly gone to bed now it is to be understood the chamber where they lay went out half over the room below rail of about four feet high being set up by the side to keep them from falling close by the rail was poor robin bed but whilst they were going to sleep the drake was shot off which poor sarah his wife hearing with the fright gave sudden start and threw poor robin quite over the rail into the room below poor robin was much bruised in body and half dead at length he got up but his courage was so cooled with the greatness of his fall that he had more need of doctor than sleep c hapter vii how poor sarah was cheated of her mutton pie poor sarah on time made very great pie into which she had put whole loin of mutton besides other things so that it was valued worth ﬁve or six shillings at least this pie she sent to the common oven to bake which being perceived by three or four merry blades they resolved if they could possibly to cheat her of the pie which at last they brought to pass on this manner at such time the baker used to draw two of them went and held poor sarah in tale whilst the other sent one of her neighbour boys to the baker with pail napkin and money to pay the baking the baker mistrusting knavery delivered the boy the pie which was presently carried to the next whether inviting some more of their companions unto them with much mirth and laughter and because the jest should be publicly known they set the crier to work who published the same in every corner of the town c hapter viii how poor robin ate instead of poor robin was more addicted to ﬂesh than ﬁsh so of all sorts of ﬂesh he loved dish of best merry disposed companion knowing his appetite resolved to put trick upon him gentleman of the town who kept pack of hounds having gelt his dogs he gets the stones and with few sweet breads presents them to poor robin dainty dish poor robin very thankful so great kindness would not stay but presently had them dressed making all the haste he could fear any should come in to be partakers with him in his dinner but having eaten them and understood the truth he fell if his gall would come up with it poor sarah in like manner disgor ged her stomach so that who should have seen them would have concluded them drunk with eating c hapter ix witty jest that poor robin gave geant 342 343 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https blue regiment of being on time at walden one of the sergeants to show his bravery had gotten great blue scarf about his middle being much or more than the ensign had in his colours poor robin thinking him too ﬁne to ﬁght would venture to put jeer upon him and calling him asked if he wanted any work why said the sergeant what makes you ask pray your pardon quoth poor robin i was mistaken in you i took you shoemaker because you had gotten your blue apron before you c hapter how poor robin won five shillings by kissing his hostess poor robin with some other of his mates being drinking in an where was an exceeding tall hostess one of them offered to lay ﬁve shillings because poor robin was low that he should not kiss her he stood on the ground poor robin accepted the challenge and covered the money but when he went to kiss her his mouth would not reach higher than her apron string whereupon dropping shilling on the ground he made her stoop to lift it then he clasped his arms round her neck gave her kiss and so won the wager c hapter xi poor robin sayings of ambitious men poor robin being in company with some gentlemen who were talking of the ambition of some men that would venture the loss of their souls the possession of kingdom yea quoth poor robin but the success of many of them is far different from king saul he seeking asses found kingdom and they seeking kingdom ﬁnd themselves to be asses c hapter xii poor robin journey to london poor robin having never been in london in his life and being very desirous to see the city whose fame rang so loud in every man mouth he resolved to make jonrney thither and spend some time in viewing the rarities of the same but because he was unacquainted with the city customs he got companion of his to go along with him sooner were they past aldgate but poor robin seeing such number of signs he whispered with his friend certainly quoth he they must needs be all drunkards that live in this place i never saw so many together in my life and thereupon beckoning to his companion enters one of the shops and calls jug of beer but they making him acquainted with his error how they sold drink but if he wanted anything else they could furnish him with it he presently without any studying asks them to show him pair of hedging gloves whereupon changing their opinion instead of fool they took him jeering companion and to ﬁt him his gloves had him to the pump and soundly bedrenched him from head to foot and having occasion to go through birching lane and being asked by the salesmen countrymen what lack you marry quoth he that which i fear you can not furnish withal and being importuned of them to know what it was why quoth he that which you have none of i want honesty night approaching poor robin and his walking mate repaired to their inn where after they had supped and drunk ﬁve or six jugs of beer with the host of the house and some of his men servants drink most of their beer at other men cost his friend loving tobacco and poor robin desiring the heathenish weed to pass away the time they agreed among themselves that every one of the company should either tell tale or sing song poor robin who ﬁrst mentioned the same beginning in this manner 344 345 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https hapter xiii tale of pair of car ds not many ages since parson of country village was accused to committee that he was great gamester at cards being so addicted thereunto that he would ofttimes play on sundays the committee thus informed sent the parson to answer this accusation who receiving the warrant made excuse nor delay but with all haste made his appearance before them with him also came the informer to justify his accusation being thus met together the committee began to reprove the parson being addicted to such vice to be noted common player at cards indeed said the parson i am so far from it that i know not what pair of cards meaneth sir quoth the informer if you please to search his pockets i believe you will ﬁnd pair there at present he seldom goeth without such tackling whereupon the committee commanding his pocket to be searched they found pair of cards there indeed but the parson denied them to be cards saying they may be cards to you but to they are an almanack and being demanded how he could make it appear he answered thus first quoth he here is many suits of cards there be quarter s in year and many court cards there be months in year and many cards there be weeks in year and many spots there be days in year then when i look upon the king it puts in mind of the allegiance that i owe to my sovereign lord the king looking upon the queen puts in mind of the allegiance that i owe to the queen the ten puts in mind of the ten commandments the nine of the nine muses the eight of the eight altitudes the seven of the seven liberal sciences the six of six days we ought to labour in the ﬁve of the ﬁve senses the four of the four evangelists the three of the trinity the two of the two sacraments and the ace that we ought to worship but one god quoth the committee if this be all the use you make of them we can ﬁnd fault with you but parson of all the cards you have nominated you have forgot the knave pray what use make you of him sir said he pointing to his accuser that is your worship informer poor robin having ended his tale says his friend i suppose that was the same parson that used to read his litany every day of the week excepting sunday and i being constant hearer of him learnt it perfectly my pater noster c hapter xiv poor robin litany from being turned out of doors from and scores from lowsie queans and pocky bores libera from tailors bills and drapers

twa these seven years the deil and andrew part them the wedding being ended all the company went to bed where we will leave them till the next morning to relate poor robin perambulation about the city c hapter xvi poor robin perambulation about the city sooner did apollo begin to appear in the eastern horizon but poor robin shaking off melancholy sleep roused his companion to prepare himself their intended perambulation and having armed themselves with pot of nappy ale they took their ﬁrst walk to see the royal exchange most magniﬁcent structure built by sir thomas gresham from thence they went to take view of leadenhall but the exceedin g bravery of the exchange had so dimmed the beauty of the place that it was nothing pleasing to poor robin eye he made tarrying there but went presently down to the tower where having seen the lions and from the wharf taken superﬁcial view of the bridge also the ships upon the river thames he became weary of beholding so many surprising 347 348 the project gutenberg ebook of amusing prose by robert hays cunningham https he had however far more content in seeing the ships so admirably pleasing to his fancy it was to see how these little pretty things hopped about but lest he should take surfeit with such ravishing delights his friend persuaded him to go to see the ancient cathedral of paul being at present made by the soldiers which poor robin beholding what blessed reformation quoth he have we here in our country we can scarce persuade men to go to church but here come men and horses too having satisﬁed himself with the sight of paul they would in the next place go to visit westminster the rather because it was at term time where beholding so great number of lawyers in their gowns he cried out oh let us begone from this place if two or three make such quarrel in our town certainly there is abiding here men in their wit country gentleman overhearing him i remember quoth he once i heard story of man that went down to hell wherein he beheld men of all professions ages and conditions saving only lawye rs which made him the more to wonder because he imagined them all there and asking the devil the reason he made this reply have them here though you see them not but we are forced to keep them in room by themselves lest they should set all the devils in hell at variance poor robin laughed very heartily at this tale and having now satisﬁed his inn and having dischar ged all reckonings his friend and he returned home c hapter xvii many odd whimsies and conceits of poor robin poor robin daily frequenting the taver n and had learned of his companions many drunken whimsies and other odd conceits the ﬁve properties that belong to an host that he must have the head of stag the bag of nag the belly of hog skip up and down like frog and fawn like dog also the four ingredients whereof woman tongue is made viz the sound of great bell the wagging of dog tail the shaking of an aspen leaf tempered with running water when poor robin had gotten cup in his crown it oftentimes happened he would then be playing the poet and nothing but rhymes could then come out of his mouth one writes poet and pot doth dif fer but one letter and that makes poets love the pot the better amongst other of his conceits this following comparison was much used by him like purse that hath chink i or cellar and drink i like jewel never worn or child untimely born like song without foot or bond and hand such doth she seem unto mine eyes that lives vir gin till she dies the money doth entice the purse the drink in the cellar quencheth thirst the jewel decks if worn it is the child soon dies abortive is the end the song doth sweetest sound the hand doth make the party bound so she that marries death takes her answers that which
