france on april and died there on august 31 flowers of evil was published in 1857 by baudelaire friend auguste poulet malassis who had inherited printing business at alençon some of them had already appeared in the revue des deux mondes the poet the publisher and the printer were found guilty of having offended against public morals pref ace in presenting to the american public this collection in english of perhaps the most inﬂuential french poet of the last seventy years i consider it essential to explain the conditions under which the work has been done baudelaire has written poems that will in all likelihood live while poetry is used medium of expression and the great inﬂuence that he has exercised on english and continental literature is mainly due to the particular quality of his style his way of feeling or his method of thought he is master of analytical power and in his highest ecstasy of emotional expression this power can readily be recognized in his own quotation he gave forth his philosophy on this point pg 8 pg 9 the project gutenberg ebook of baudelaire his prose and poetry by charles baudelaire https the more art would aim at being philosophically clear the more will it degrade itself and return to the childish hieroglyphic on the other hand the more art detaches itself from teaching the more will it attain to pure disinterested beauty poetry under pain of death or decay can not assimilate hers elf to science or ethics she has not truth object she has only herself what appears at ﬁrst glance in the preceding phrases to be contradiction is really conﬁrmation of baudelaire conception of the highest understanding of æsthetic principle baudelaire ideal beauty is tempered with mystery and sadness the real too but never the commonplace poet has brought so many new ideas in sensation into literary style intellectually he is all sensation though he seldom degenerates into abstract sentimentality this sum totality of the power of absorbing external sensation is baudelaire from the effect of his objectivity his art expresses itself if solely subjective this condition of mind and art makes him most difﬁcult to translate into another language in particular english this collection of his verse and prose is gathered from those experiments in translation which i think will most effectively convey to the english reader those qualities that made baudelaire what he is there are numerous translations from baudelaire in english but most of them may be dismissed being seldom successful arthur symons translation of some of the prose poems is most beautiful adventure in psychological sensations effective though not always accurate in interpretation sturm effort with the flowers of evil and the prose poems is always accurate sometimes inspired and often tour force of translatio robertson translations from the flowers of evil is the most successful of all he maintains with amazing facility all the subtlety beauty and one might also say the perfume of

baudelaire study by sturm i charles baudelaire was one of those who take the downward path which leads to salvation there are men born to be the martyrs of the world and of their own time men whose imagination carries them beyond all that we know or have learned to think of law and order who are so intoxicated with vision of beauty beyond the world that the world beauty seems to them but little paint above the face of the dead who love god with so consuming ﬁre that they must praise evil god glory and blaspheme his name that all sects and creeds may be melted away who see beneath all there is of mortal loveliness the invisible worm feeding upon hopes and desires less than upon the fair pg 10 pg 11 the project gutenberg ebook of baudelaire his prose and poetry by charles baudelaire https perishable ﬂesh who are good and evil at the same time and because the good and evil in their souls ﬁnds so perfect instrument in the reﬁned and tortured body of modern times desire keener pleasure and more intolerable anguish than the world contains and become materialists because the tortured heart cries out in denial of the soul that tortures it charles baudelaire was one of these men his art is the expression of his decadence study of his art is the understanding of that complex movement that inquietude of the veil in the temple mallarmé called it that has changed the literature of the world and especially made of poetry the subtle and delicate instrument of emotional expression it has become in our own day we used to hear deal about decaden ce in the arts and now we hear much about symbolism which is ﬂower sprung from the old baudelaire is decadence his art is not mere literary affectation mask of sorrow to be thrown aside when the curtain falls but the voice of an imagination plunged into the contemplation of all the perverse and fallen loveliness of the world that ﬁnds beauty most beaut iful at the moment of its passing away and regrets its perishing with so poignant grief that it must needs follow it even into the narrow grave where those dark comrades the worms without ears without eyes whisper their secrets of terror and tell of yet another pour ce vieux corps sans âme et mort parmi les morts all his life baudelaire was victim to an unutterable weariness that terrible malady of the soul born out of old times to prey upon civilisations that have reached their weariness not of life but of living of continuing to labour and suffer in world that has exhausted all its emotions and has new thing to offer being an artist therefore he took his revenge upon life by gloriﬁcation of all the sorrowful things that it is life continual desire to forget his poems speak sweetly of decay and death and whisper their graveyard secrets into the ears of beauty his men are men whom the moon has touched with her own phantasy who love the immense ungovernable sea the unformed and multitudinous waters the place where they are not the woman they will never know and all his women are enigmatic courtesans whose beauty is transﬁguration of sin who hide the ugliness of the soul beneath the perfection of the body he loves them and does not love they are cruel and indolent and full of strange perversions they are perfumed with exotic perfumes they sleep to the sound of viols or fan themselves languidly in the shadow and only he sees that it is the shadow of death an art like this rooted in so tortured perception of the beauty and ugliness of world where the spirit is mingled indistinguishably with the ﬂesh almost inevitably concerns itself with material things with all the subtle raptures the soul feels not by abstract contemplation that would mean content but through the gateway of the senses the lust of the ﬂesh the delight of the eye sound colour odour form to him these are not the symbols that lead the soul towards the inﬁnite they are the soul they are the inﬁnite he writes always with weary and laborious grace about the abstruser and more enigmatic things of the ﬂesh colours and odours particularly but unlike those later writers who have been called realists he apprehends to borrow phrase from pater all those ﬁner conditions wherein material things rise to that subtlety of operation which constitutes them spiritual where only the ﬁner nerve and the keener touch can follow in one of his sonnets he says je hais la passion et fait mal and indeed he is poet in whom the spirit modern thought understands the word had little or part we feel reading his terrible poems that the body is indeed acutely conscious of the soul distressfully and even angrily conscious but its motions are not yet subdued by the soul prophetic voice it was to forget this voice with its eternal esto memor that baudelaire wrote imperishablÿ of perishable things and their fading glory ii pg 12 pg 13 pg 14 the project gutenberg ebook of baudelaire his prose and poetry by charles baudelaire https baudelaire was born at paris april 21st 1821 in an old turreted house in the rue hautefeuille his father distinguished gentleman of the y school seems to have passed his manners on to his son we learn from baudelaire friend and biographer théophile gautier that the poet always preserved the forms of an extreme urbanity at school during his childhood he gained many distinctions and passed kind of infant prodigy but later on when he sat his examination bachelier ès lettres his extreme nervousness made him appear almost an idiot failing miserably he made second attempt then his father died and his mother married general aupick afterwards ambassador to constantinople an excellent man in every respect but quite incapable of sympathising with or even of understa nding the love literature that now began to manifest itself in the mind of his stepson all possible means were tried to turn him from literature to some more lucrative and more respectable profession family quarrels arose over this question and young baudelaire who seems to have given some real cause offence to the whose aspirations and profession he despised was at length sent away upon long voyage in the hopes that the sight of strange lands and new faces would perhaps cause him to forget the ambitions his relatives could but consider foolish and idealistic he sailed the indian seas visited the islands of mauritius bourbon madagascar and ceylon saw the yellow waters of the sacred ganges stored up the memory of tropical sounds and colours and odours use later on and returned to paris shortly after his birthday more than ever determined to be man of letters his parents were in despair doubt quite rightly so from their point of view théophile gautier perhaps remembering the many disappointments and martyrdoms of his own sad life defends the attitude of general aupick in passage where he poignantly describes the hopelessness of the profession of letters the future author of the flowers of evil however was now his own master and in position so far monetary matters were concerned to follow out his own whim he took apartments in the hôtel pimodan kind of literary where all bohemia met and where gautier and boissard were also at that period installed then began that life of uninterrupted labour and meditation that has given to france her most characteristic literature these poems of baudelaire are not only original in themselves but have been the cause of originality in others they are the root of modern french literature and much of the best english literature they were the origin of that new method in poetry that gave mallarmé and verlaine to france yeats and some others to england it was in the hôtel pimodan that baudelaire and gautier ﬁrst met and formed one of those unfading friendships not so rare among men of letters among men of the world there also the held the séances that have since become famous in the history of literature hashish and opium indeed contribute not little to the odour of the strange flowers of evil also perhaps they contributed to baudelaire death from the terrible malady known general paralysis he was man who could not resist so easy path into the world of macabr visions i shall return to this question again there is internal evidence in his writings that shows he made good literary use of these dreams which in the end dragged him into their own abyss it was in 1849 when baudelaire was years of age that he made the acquaintance of the already famous théophile gautier from whose admirabl essay i shall presently translate passage giving us an excellent of the famous poet and baudelaire was cynic he had not in the least degree the rapt expression and vague personality usually supposed to be characteristic of the poetic mood he recalls wrote dulamon who knew him well one of those beautiful abbés of the eighteenth century so correct in their doctrine so indulgent in their commerce with the abbé bernis example at the same time he writes better verse and would not have demanded at rome the destruction of the order of jesuits that was baudelaire exactly suave and polished ﬁlled with sceptical faith cynical with the terrible cynicism of the scholar who is acutely conscious of all the morbid and gloomy secrets hidden beneath the fair exteriors of the world gautier in the passage i pg 15 pg 16 the project gutenberg ebook of baudelaire his prose and poetry by charles baudelaire https already mentioned emphasises both his reserve and his cynicism contrary to the somewhat loose manners of artists gene rally baudelaire prided himself upon observing the most rigid convenances his courtesy indeed was excessive to the point of seeming affected he measured his sentences using only the most carefully chosen terms and pronounced certain words in particular manner though he wished to underline them and give them mysterious importance he had italics and capital letters in his voice exaggeration much in honour at pimodan he disdained being theatrical and gross though he himself affected paradox and excess with very simple very natural and perfectly detached air though retailing la prudhomme newspaper paragraph about the mildness or rigour of the weather he would advance some satanically monstrous axiom or uphold with the coolness of ice some theory of mathematical extravagance he always followed rigorous plan in the development of his follies his spirit was neither in words nor traits he saw things from particular point of view so that their outlines were changed objects when one gets view of them he perceived analogies inappreciable to others and you were struck by their fantastic logic his rare gestures were slow and sober he never threw his arms about he held southern gesticulation in horror british coolness seemed to him to be good taste one might describe him dandy who had straye d into bohemia though still preserving his rank and that cult of self which characterises man imbued with the principles of brummel at this time baudelaire was practically unknown outside his own circle of friends writers themselves and it was not until eight years later in 1857 when he published his flowers of evil that he became famous infamous would perhaps be better word to describe the kind of fame he at ﬁrst obtained every philistine in france joined in the cry against poet who dared to remind his readers that the grave awaits even the rich who dared to choose the materials of his art from among the objects of death and decay who exposed the mouldering secrecies of the grave and painted in the phosphorescent colours of corruption frescoes of death and horror who desecrated love in the sonne t entitled causerie you are sky of autumn pale and rose but all the sea of sadness in my blood surges and ebbing leaves my lip morose salt with the memory of the bitter ﬂood in vain your hand glides my faint bosom that which you seek beloved is desecrate by woman tooth and talon ah more seek in heart which those dogs ate it is ruin where the jackals rest and rend and tear and glut themselves and slay perfume swims about your naked breast beauty hard scour ge of spirits have your way with eyes that at bright feasts have ﬂared burn up these tatters that the beasts have spared we can recall nothing like it in the literary history of our own country the sensation caused by the appearance of the ﬁrst series of swinburne poems and ballads was mild in comparison just swinburne poems were but wan derivati ves from least far ideas are concerned i say nothing about their beauty of expression or almost absolute mastery of it is quite obvious that the english poet was indebted to baudelaire all the bizarre and satanic elements in his work baudelaire was indebted to poe swinburne however is wild where baudelaire is grave and where baudelaire compresses some perverse and morbid image into single unfor gettable line swinburne beats it into froth of many musical lovely words until we get the deep sea in the shining foam if we call to mind the reception at ﬁrst given to the work of aubrey beardsley it will give some idea of the consternation caused in france by the appearance pg 17 pg 18 the project gutenberg ebook of baudelaire his prose and poetry by charles baudelaire https the flowers of evil beardsley indeed resembles baudelaire in many ways he achieved in art what the other achieved in literature the apotheosis of the horrible and grotesque the perfecting of symbols to shadow forth intellectual sin the tearing away of the decent veil of forgetfulness that hides our own corruption from our eyes and his one prose romance under the hill unhappily incomplete at his death at the age of four beats baudelaire on his own ground the four or ﬁve chapters which alone remain of this incomplete romance stand alone in literature they are the absolute attainment of what baudelaire more or less successfully testament of sin not the sin of the ﬂesh the gross faults of the body that are vulgarly known sin but sin which is metaphysical corruption depravity of pure intellect the sin of the fallen angels in hell who cover their anguish with the sound of harps and sweet odours who are incapable of bodily impurity and whom spiritua l purity is the only terror and since mortality which is the shadow of the immortal can comprehend spiritual and abstract things only by the analogies and correspondences which exist between them and the far reﬂections of them that we call reality both baudelaire and beardsley indeed all artists who speak with tongues of spiritual truth choose more or less actual human beings to be the shadows of the divine or satanic beings they would invoke and make them sin delicate sins of the reﬁned bodily sense that we may get glimpse of the evil that is not mortal but immortal the spiritual evil that has set up its black throne beside the throne of spiritual good and has equal share in the shaping of the world and man i am not sure that baudelaire when he wrote this sinister poetry had any clear idea that it was his vocation to be prophet either of good or evil certainly he had thought of founding school of poetry and if he made any conscious effort to bring new method into literature it was merely because he desired to be one of the famous writers of his country an inspired thinker however whether his inspiration be mighty or small receives his thought from profounder source than his own physical reason and writes to the dictation of beings outside of and greater than himself the famous eliphas levi like all the mystics who came before and after him from basilides the gnostic to blake the english visionary taught that the poet and dreamer are the mediums of the divine word and sole instruments through which the gods energise in the world of material things the writing of great book is the casting of pebble into the pool of human thought it gives rise to circles that will reach we know not whither and begins chain of circumstances that may end in the destruction of kingdoms and religions and the awakening of new gods the change wrought directly or indirectly by the flowers of evil alone is almost too great to be properly understood there is perhaps not man in europe whose outlook on life would not have been different had the flowers of evil never been written the ﬁrst thing that happens after the publication of such book is the theft of its ideas and the imitation of its style by the lesser writers who labour the multitude and so its teaching goes from book to book from the greater to the lesser the divine hierarchies emanate from divinity until ideas that were once paradoxical or even blasphemous and unholy have become mere newspaper commonplaces adopted by the numberless thousands who not think themselves and the world thought is changed completely though by inﬁnite slow degrees the immediate result of baudelaire work was the decadent school in french literature then the inﬂuence spread across the channel and the english æsthetes arose to preach the gospel of imagination to the unimaginative both decadence and æstheticism intellectual movements have fallen into the nadir of oblivion and the dust lies heavy upon them but they left little leaven to lighten the heavy inertness of correct and academic literature and now symbolism greater movement than either is in the ascendant giving another turn to the wheel and to all who think deeply about such matters it seems though symbolist literature is to be the literature of the future the decadents and æsthetes were weak because they had banner to ﬁght beneath authority to appeal to in defence of their views deﬁnite gospel to preach they were by turns morbid hysterical foolishly blasphemous or weakly disgusting but never anything long their one desire being to produce thrill at any cost if the hospital failed they went to the brothel and when even obscenity failed to stimulate the jaded palates of their generation there was still the graveyard left more or less successful imitation of baudelaire awful verse s entitled pg 19 pg 20 pg 21 the project gutenberg ebook of baudelaire his prose and poetry by charles baudelaire https the corpse has been the beginning of more than one french poet corrupt ﬂight across the sky of literature that baudelaire himself was one of their company is not an accusation he had genius which his imitators english or french have not and his book even apart from the fact that it made straight the way better things must be admitted to be great and work of art by whosoever reads it with understanding and moreover his morbidness is not at all an affectation his poems inevitably prove the writer to have been quite sincere in his perversion and in his decadence the symbolist writers of thoug h they are sprung from him are greater than he because they are the prophets of faith who believe in what they preach they ﬁnd their defence in the writings of the mystics and their doctrines are at the root of every religion they were held by the gnostics and are in the books of the kabbalists and the magi blake preached them and eliphas levi taught them to his disciples in france who in turn have misunderstood and perverted them and formed strange religions and sects of worshippers these doctrines hold that the visible world is the world of illusion not of reality colour and sound and perfume and all material and sensible things are but the symbols and reﬂections of the things that are alone real reality is hidden away from us by the ﬁve senses and the gates of death and reason the blind and laborious servant of the physical brain deludes us into believing that we can know anything of truth through the medium of the senses it is through the imagination alone that man can obtain spiritual revelation imagination is the one window in the of the ﬂesh through which the soul can see the proud images of eternity and blake who is the authority of all english symbolist writers long since formulated their creed in words that have been quoted again and again and must still be quoted by all who write in defence of modern art the world of imagination is the world of eternity it is the divine bosom into which we shall all go after the death of the vegetated body this world of imagination is inﬁnite and eternal wher eat the world of generation or vegetation is ﬁnite and temporal there exist in that eternal world the permanent realities of everything which we see r eﬂected in this vegetable glass of natur in spite of the cry against flowers of evil baudelaire did not lack defenders among literary men themselves and many enthusiastic articles were written in praise of his book thierry not unjustly compared him to dante to which barbey replied baudelaire comes from hell dante only went there adding at the ﬁnish of his article after the flowers of evil there are only two possible ways the poet who made them blossom either to blow out his brains or become christian baudelaire did neither and victor hugo after reading the two poems the seven old men and the little old women wrote to baudelaire you have dowered the heaven of art with one knows not what deathly gleam he said in his letter you have created new shud der the phrase became famous and many years after this the creation of new shudder was the ambition of every young french writer worth his salt when the ﬁrst great wave of public astonishment had broken and ebbed baudelaire work began to be appreciated by others than merely literary men by all in fact who cared

not have gone to hashish to discover this the mystics of all times have taught that sounds in gross matter produce colour in subtle matter and all who are subject to any visionary condition know that when in trance colours will produce words of language whose meaning is forgotten soon one awakes to normal life but i not think baudelaire was visionary his work shows too precise method and too ordered appreciation of the artiﬁcial in beauty there again he is comparable to aubrey beardsley i have read somewhere that when beardsley was asked if ever he saw visions he replied i not permit myself to see them except upon paper the whole question of the colour of sound is one of supreme interest to the poet but it is too difﬁcult and abstract question to be written of here famous sonnet

somewhat less unhappy during his life they certainly contributed to hasten his death always of an extremely neurotic temperament he began to break down beneath his excesses and shortly after the publication of the artiﬁcial paradises which shows considerable deteriorat ion in his style he removed from paris to brussels in the hope of building up his health by the change at brussels he grew worse his speech began to fail he was unable to pronounce pg 24 pg 25 the project gutenberg ebook of baudelaire his prose and poetry by charles baudelaire https words and stumbled over others hallucinations commenced longer the hallucinations of hashish and his disea rapidly establishing itself was recognised general paralysis of the insane gautier tells how the news of his death came to paris while he yet lived it was false news but prematurely true baudelaire lingered on another three months motionless and inert his eyes the only part of him alive unable to speak or even to write and so died he left besides the flowers of evil and little poems in prose his masterpieces several volumes of critical essays published under the titles of æsthetic curiosities and romantic art the artiﬁcial paradises and his translations of the works of edgar allan pieces of work by which poe actually gains iii baudelaire love of the artiﬁcial has been insisted upon by all who have studied his work but to my mind never sufﬁciently insisted upon it was the foundati on of his method he wrote many arguments in favour of the artiﬁcial and elaborated them into kind of paradoxical philosophy of art his hatred of nature and purely natural things was but perverted form of the religious ecstasy that made the old monk pull his cowl about his eyes when he left his cell in the month of may lest he should see the blossoming trees and his mind be turned towards the beautiful delusions of the world the egyptians and the earliest of the christians looked upon nature not the work of the good and benevolent spirit who is the father of our souls but the work of the rebellious gods of generation who fashion beautiful things to capture the heart of man and bind his soul to earth blake whom i have already quoted hated nature in the same fashion and held death to be the one way of escape from the delusions of goddess nature and her laws baudelaire revolt against external things was more revolt of the intellect than of the imagination and he expresses it not by desiring that the things of nature should be swept away to make room the things of the spirit but that they should be so changed by art that they cease to be natural he was of all poets the most intensely modern holding that modernity is of art the other half being something eternal and immutable he preferred unlike blake and his modern followers to express himself in quite modern terms and so wrote his famous and much misunderstood éloge du maquillage to defend his views was usual with him he pushed his ideas to their extreme logical sequence and the casua l reader who picks up that extraordinary essay is in consequence quite misled to the writer intention it seems scarcely necessary at this time of day to assert that the éloge du maquillage is something more than mere praise of cosmetics written by man who wished to shock his readers it is the part expression of theory of art and if it is paradoxical and fetched it is because baudelaire wrote at time when french literature in the words of asselineau was dying of correctnes s and needed very vigorous treatment indeed if the éloge du maquillage had been more restrained in manner if it had not been something so entirely contrary to all accepted ideas of the citizen who never thinks thought that somebody else has not put into his head it might have been passed over without notice it was written to initiate the profane to make them think at least and not to raise smile among the initiated and moreover it was in manner defence of his own work that had met with so much hatred and opposition he begins by attempting to prove that nature is innately and fundamentally wrong and wicked the greater number of errors relative to the beautiful date from the eighteenth century false conceptions of morality nature was regarded in those times the base source and type of all possible good and beauty if however we consent to refer simply to the visible facts we see that nature teaches nothing or almost nothing that is to say she forces man to sleep to drink to eat and to protect himself well or ill against the hostilities of the atmosphere it is she also who moves him to kill and eat or imprison and torture his kind soon we leave the region of necessities and needs pg 26 pg 27 pg 28 the project gutenberg ebook of baudelaire his prose and poetry by charles baudelaire https enter into that of luxuries and pleasures we see that nature is better than counsellor to crime religion commands us to nourish our poor and inﬁrm parents nature the voice of our own interest commands us to away with them pass in review analyse all that is natural all the actions and desires of the natural man and you will ﬁnd nothing but what is horrible all beautiful and noble things are the result of calculation crime the taste whic h the human animal absorbs before birth is originally natural virtue on the contrary is artiﬁcial supernatural since there has been necessity in all ages and among all nations gods and prophets to preach virtue to humanity since man alone would have been unable to discover it evil is done without effort naturally and by fatality good is always the product of an art so far the argument is straightforward and expresses what many must have thought but baudelaire remembering that exaggeration is the best way of impressing one ideas upon the unimaginative immediately carries his argument from the moral order to the order of the beautiful and applies it there the result is strange enough i am thus led to regard personal adornment one of the signs of the primitive nobility of the human soul the races that our confused and perverted civilisation with fatuity and pride entirely laughable treats savages understand does the child the high spirituality of the toilet the savage and the child by their naïve love of all brilliant things of glittering plumage and shining stuffs and the superlative majesty of artiﬁcial forms bear witness to their distaste reality and so prove unknown to themselves the immateriality of their souls thus with some appearance of logic he carries his argument step farther and this immediately brings him to the bizarre conclusion that the more beautiful woman naturally is the more she should hide her natural beauty beneath the artiﬁcial charm of rouge and powder she performs duty in attempting to appear magical and supernatural she is an idol who must adorn herself to be adored powder and rouge and kohl all the little artiﬁces that shock respectability have their end the creation of an abstract unity in the grain and colour of the skin this unity brings the human being nearer to the condition of is to say divine and superior being red and black are the symbols of an excessive and supernatural life touch of kohl lends to the eye more decided appearance of window opened upon inﬁnity and rouge augments the brilliance of the eye and adds to beautiful feminine face the mysterious passion of the priestess but artiﬁce can not make ugliness any the less ugly nor help age to rival youth who dare assign to art the sterile function of imitating nature deception if it is to have any charm must be obvious and unashamed it must be displayed if not with af fectation at least with kind of candour such theories these if they are sincerely held necessarily lead the theorist into the strangest bypaths of literature baudelaire like many another writer whose business is with verse pondered so long upon the musical and rhythmical value of words that at times words became meaningless to him he thought his own language too simple to express the complexities of poetic reverie and dreamed of writing his poems in latin not however in the latin of classical times that was too robust too natural too brutal and purely epidermic to use an expression of his own but in the corrupt latin of the byzantine decadence which he considered the supreme sigh of strong being already transformed and prepared the spiritual life one of these latin poems has appeared in all editions of the flowers of evil though dozens good are to be found in the breviary of the roman church franciscæ meæ laudes has been included in this selection the beneﬁt of those curious in such matters it is one of baudelaire many successful steps in the wrong direction iv pg 29 pg 30 the project gutenberg ebook of baudelaire his prose and poetry by charles baudelaire https almost every line of the flowers of evil one can trace the inﬂuence of edgar poe and in the many places where baudelaire has attained pure imaginative beauty in the sadness of the moon or music or the death of lovers it is beauty that would have pleased the author of tales of the grotesque and arabesque another kind of beauty the beauty of in baudelaire crucible everything is melted into even more directly traceable to poe in spite of the sonnet correspondences and in spite of his symbolist followers of the present day baudelaire himself made but an imperfect use of such symbols he had and these he found ready to his hand in the works of the american poet the tomb the symbol of death or of an intellectual darkness inhabited by the worm who is remorse the abyss which is the despair into which the mortal part of man mind plunges when brought into contact with dead and perishing substances all these are borrowed from poe the worm who devours with kiss occasionally becomes time devouring life or the demon the obscure enemy who gnaws the heart and when it is none of these it is the serpent in that sombre poem to madonna serpent beneath the feet of conquering purity baudelaire imagination however which continually ran upon macabr images loved remorse more than peace and loved the serpent more than the purity that would slay it so he destroys purity with seven knives which are the seven deadly sins that the serpent may live to prey upon heart that ﬁnds beauty in peace even love is evil his ancient arrows are crime horror folly and the god eros becomes demon lying in wait let us love gently love from his retreat ambushed and shadowy bends his fatal bow and i too well his ancient arrows know crime horror folly gautier pretends that the poet preserved his ideal under the form of the adorable phantom of la beatrix the ideal ever desired never attained the divine and superior beauty incarnated in an ethereal woman spiritualised made of light and ﬂame and perfume vapour dream reﬂection of the seraphical world but when baudelaire has vision of this same beatrice he sees her one of crowd of cruel and curious demons who mock at his sorrow and she too mocks him and caresses the demons who are his spiritual foes baudelaire was too deeply in love with the artiﬁcial to care overmuch the symbols he could have found among natural objects only once in the flowers of evil does he look upon the moon with the eyes of mystic and that is when he remembers that all people of imagination are under the moon inﬂuence and makes his poet hide her iridescent tear in his heart far from the eyes of the sun the sun is lord of material labours and therefore hostile to the dreams and reveries that are the activity of the poet he sought more bizarre analogies and striking metaphors than true symbols or correspondences he is happiest when comparing the vault of the heaven to the lighted ceiling of music hall or the black lid of the mighty pot where the human generations boil and when he thinks of the unfortunate and unhappy folk of the world he does not see any hope them in any future state he sees simply god awful claw stretched out to tear them he of fers pity but comfort sometimes he has vision of beauty unmingled with any malevolence but it is always evoked by sensuous and material things perfume or music and always it is sorrowful loveliness he mourns or praises perhaps of all his poems the balcony is most full of that tender and reverential melancholy we look in poem of love but even it tells of passion that has faded out of heart and mind and become beautiful only with its passing away and not of an existing love the other love indeed such name can be given to madrigal of sorrow the eyes of beauty the remorse of the dead and the nothing but terrible confessions of satiety or cruelty or terror i have translated the corpse his most famous and most infamous poem partly because it shows him at his worst the others in the volume at his best partly because it is something of the nature of literary curiosity poem like the corpse which is simply an example of what may happen if any writer pushes his theories to the extreme does not at all detract be it said from baudelaire delicate genius though he may not be quite pg 31 pg 32 the project gutenberg ebook

the moderns alongside hugo and verlaine read the sonnet entitled beauty and you will see how he has invoked in fourteen lines the image of goddess mysterious and immortal fair that aphrodite who cast the shadow of her loveliness upon the golden age terrible pallas the warrior maid invincible and mine rva loved mortality in the person of ulysses so baudelaire personiﬁcation of beauty loves the poets who pray before her and gaze into her eternal eyes watching the rising and setting of their visionary star in those placid mirrors the explanation of most of baudelaire morbid imaginings is this that he was man haunted by terrible memories chief among them the memory that the loveliness he had adored in curve of perfect cheek the lifting of perfect arm in some gesture of imperial indolence the fall of curl across pale brow all the minute and unfor gettable things that give immortality to some movement of all these and the woman and her lover must pass away from time and space and he unhappily knew nothing of the philosophy that teaches us how all objects and events even the most woman gesture rose sigh fading ﬂame the sound that trembles on place in eternity when they pass from the recognition of our senses if he believed in the deathle ssness of man personality he gained comfort from his belief he mourned the body decay he was not concerned with the soul and heaven less palpable than mohammed could have had any reality in his imagination his prose is distinguished in its manner his verse i think it was professor saintsbury who ﬁrst brought the little poems in prose selection from which is included in this volume before the notice of english readers in an essay written many years ago i am writing this in france far from the possibility of consulting any english books but if my memory serves rightly he considered the prose of these prose poems to be perfect literature can be i think he said they go far prose can go they need other introduction than themselves they are perfect of their kind and not different in thought from the more elaborately wrought poems of the flowers of evil some of them instance every man his chimæra are classical and universally true the myths and symbolisms of the old testament and all of them i think are worthy of place in that book the archangel of the presence will consult when all is weighed in the balance book written by man himself the record of his deep and shallow imaginings baudelaire wrote them he said because he had dreamed in his days of ambition of miracle of poetical prose musical without rhythm and without rhyme his attitude of mind was always so natural to him that he never thought it necessary to make any excuse the spirit of his art or the drear philosophy he preached unless short notice printed in the ﬁrst edition of his poems but withdrawn from the second edition explaining that faithful to his dolorous programme the author of the flowers of evil perfect comedian has had to mould his spirit to all sophisms to all corruptions can be considered an excuse from whatever point of view we regard him whether we praise his art and blame his philosophy or blame his art and praise his philosophy he is difﬁcult to analyse he is difﬁcult to give place to we have none with whom to compare him or very few too few to be of service to the critic his art is like the pearl beautiful produc t of disease and to blame it is like blaming the pearl he looked upon life very much poe whom he so admired looked upon it with the eye of sensitive spectator in some gloomy vault of the spanish inquisition where beauty was upon the rack he was horriﬁed but unable to turn from sight that fascinated him by its very terror his moments of inspiration are haunted by the consciousness that evil beings clothed with horror with shroud are ever lingering about the temp le of life and awaiting an opportunity to enter he was like man who awakens tremblin g from nightmare afraid of the darkness and unable to believe the dawn may be less hopeless than the midnight perhaps he was haunted many artists and all mystics by fear of madness and of the unseen world of evil shapes that sanity hides

shapes of terror that haunted baudelaire shelley too writes of them with profound knowledge the magical writer of the middle ages they come to haunt his prometheus blackening the birth of day with countless wings and hollow underneath like death they are the elemental beings who dwell beside the soul of the dreamer and the poet like vain loud multitude turning life into death and all beautiful

lean dogs pursue through wood and lake some struck and sobbing fawn we track all things that weep and bleed and live when the great king betrays them to our will and every man gives them of the

assume the semblance of hell but the imagination of man is carathi s to explore with impunity its every cavern alas the grim legion of sepulchral terrors can not be regarded altogether fanciful but

disposition who seek to depose princes and without consulting it to reconstitute society the lords in question were arrested together with fancioulle and condemned to death i would readily believe that the prince was almost sorry to ﬁnd his favourite actor among the rebels the prince was neither better nor worse than any other prince but an excessive sensibility rendered him in many cases more cruel and more despoti c than all his fellows passionately enamoured of the ﬁne arts an excellent connoisseur well he was truly insatiable of pleasures indif ferent enough in regard to men and morals himself real artist he feared enemy but ennui and the extravagant efforts that he made to ﬂy or to vanquish this tyrant of the world would certainly have brought upon him on the part of severe historian the epithet of monster had it been permitted in his dominions to write anything whatever which did not tend exclusively to pleasure or to astonishment which is one of the most delicate forms of pleasure the great misfortune of the prince was that he had theatre vast enough his genius there are young neros who are stiﬂed within too narrow limits and whose names and whose intentions will never be known to future ages an unforeseeing providence had given to this man faculties greater than his dominions suddenly the rumour spread that the sovereign had decided to pardon all the conspirators and the origin of this rumour was the announcement of special performance in which fancioulle would play one of his best rôles and at which even the condemned nobles it was said were to be present an eviden t sign added superﬁcial minds of the generous tendencies of the prince on the part of man so naturally and deliberately eccentric anything was possible even virtue even mercy

succeeded in penetrating further into the depths of this sick and curious soul it was inﬁnitely more probable that the prince was wishful to estimate the quality of the scenic talents of man condemned to death he would proﬁt by the occasion to obtain physiological expe rience of capital interest and to verify to what extent the habitual faculties of an artist would be altered or modiﬁed by the extraordinary situation in which he found himself beyond this did there exist in his mind an intention more or less deﬁned of mercy it is point that has never been solved at last the great day having come the little court displayed all its pomps and it would be difﬁcult to realise without having seen it what splendour the privileged classes of little state with limited resources can show forth on

silent or little burdened with words such are often the principal ones in those fairy plays whose object is to represent symbolically the mystery of life he came upon the stage lightly and with perfect ease which in itself lent some support in the minds of the noble public to the idea of kindness and giveness when we say of an actor this is good actor we make use of formula which implies that under the personage we can still distinguish the actor that is to say art effort will now if an actor should succeed in being in relation to the personage whom he is appointed to express

were effaced from life since then many mimes justly appreciated in different countries have played before the court of but none of them have ever been able to recall the marvellous talents of

occasion in the life of the poor devil perhaps even to know the diverse consequences disastrous or other wise that counterfeit in the hands of mendicant can engender could it not multiply itself in valid pieces could it not also lead him to jail baker example might perhaps have him arrested forger or spreader of counterfeits quite well the counterfeit coin might be poor little speculator the germ of several days wealth and so my fancy ran its course lending wings to the spirit of my friend and drawing all possible deductions from all imaginable hypotheses but he abruptly burst my revery asunder by taking up my own words yes you are right there is sweeter pleasure than to surprise man by giving him more than he expected i looked into the whites of his eyes and i was frightened to see that his eyes shone with an undeniable candor i then saw clearly that he wished to combine charity and good stroke of business to gain forty sous and the heart of god to sweep into paradise

luxury that none of the better homes in paris can nearly approach it seemed odd to that i could have passed by this enchanting den so often without divining the entrance there reigned an exquisite though heady atmo sphere which made one forget almost at once all the fastidious horrors of life there one breathed somber blessedness similar to that which the experienced when disembarking on an enchanted isle bright with the glimmerings of eternal afternoon they felt growing within them to the drowsy sound of melodious cascades the desire never to see again their hearthstones their wives their children and never to remount the high sur ges of the sea strange visages of men and women were there marked with fatal beauty which it seemed to i had already seen in epochs and in lands i could not precisely recall and which inspired rather with fraternal sympathy than with that fear which is usually born at sight of the unknown if i wished to try to deﬁne in any way the singular expression of these visages i should say that i had never seen eyes burning more feverishly with dread of ennui and with the immortal desire of feeling themselves alive my host and i were already when we sat down old and perfect friends we ate we drank beyond measure of all sorts of extraordinary wines was less extraordinary seemed to after several hours that i was more drunken than he play that superhuman pleasure had meanwhile irregularly interrupted our frequent libations and i must say that i staked and lost my soul at the rubber with heroic heedlessness and lightness the soul is so

which it is impossible to be deceived it is maternal love it is difﬁcult to imagine mother without maternal love light without heat is it not then perfectly legitimate to attribute to maternal love all the words and actions of mother relating to her child none the less hear this little story in which i was singularly mystiﬁed by the most natural illusion my profession of painter drives to regard attentively the visages the physiognomies which present themselves on my way and you know what joy we derive from this faculty which renders life more vivid and signiﬁcant in our eyes than other men in the secluded section where i live and where great grassy spaces still separate the buildings i often observed child whose ardent and roguish countenance more than all the rest won straightway he posed more than once and i transformed him now into little gypsy now into an angel now into mythological love i made him bear the violin of the vagabond the crown of thorns and the nails of the passion and the torch of eros at length i took so lively pleasure in all the drollery of the youngster that one day i begged his parents poor folk to be kind enough to yield him to promising to clothe him well to give him money and not to impose on him any task beyond cleaning my brushes and running my errands the child with his face washed became charming and the life he led with seemed paradise compared to that he had under gone in the parental hovel only i must say that the little fellow astonished at times by singular spells of precocious sadness and that he soon manifested an immoderate taste sugar and liqueurs so much so that one day when i found that despite my numerous warnings he had again been doing some pilfering of that sort i threatened to send him back to his parents then i went out and my business kept away quite some time pg 84 pg 85 the project gutenberg ebook of baudelaire his prose and poetry by charles baudelaire https what was my surprise and horror when reëntering the house the ﬁrst object that met my eyes was my little fellow the frolicsome companion of my life hanging from the panel of the closet his feet almost touched the ﬂoor chair which he had doubtless thrust back with his foot was overturned beside him his head was bent convulsively over one shoulder his bloated face and his eyes quite wide open with fearful ﬁxity gave at ﬁrst the illusion of life to take him down was not so easy business you might think he was already quite stiff and i had an inexplicable repugnance to letting him fall heavily to the ﬂoor it was necessary to bear his whole weight on one arm and with the free hand to cut the rope but that accomplished all was not yet done the little monster had made use of very slender twine which had entered deep into his ﬂesh and i must now with delicate scissors seek the cord between the two cushions of the swelling to disengage the neck i have neglected to tell you that i called vigorously help but all my neighbors refused to come to my assistance faithful in that to the habits of civilized man who never wishes i know not why to mix in the affairs of one that has been hanged finally physician came who said that the child had been dead several hours when later we had to disrobe him burial the cadaverous rigidity was such that despairing of bending his limbs we had to tear and cut the garments to remove them the commissioner to whom naturally i had to announce the casualty looked at askew and said to something suspicious moved doubtless by an inveterate desire and professional habit of frightening at all events the innocent well the guilty there remained supreme task to perform the thought of which alone gave terrible anguish i had to notify the parents my feet refused to guide to them finally i had the courage but to my great astonishment the mother was unmoved not tear oozed from the corner of her eye i attributed that strangeness to the very horror she must feel and i recalled the maxim most terrible sorrows are silent ones to the father he contented himself with saying with an air half brutalized half pensive all it is perhaps the best he would always have come to bad end however the body was stretched out on my couch and assisted by servant i was busying myself with the ﬁnal preparations when the mother entered my studio she wished she said to see the body of her son i could not in truth deny her the intoxication of her grief and refuse her that supreme and somber consolation then she begged to show her the place where her little one had hanged himself madam i answered would be bad you and my eyes turned involuntarily toward the fatal cupboard i perceived with disgust mingled with horror and wrath that the nail had remained driven in the casing with long still hanging i leapt rapidly to snatch away the last traces of the misfortune and i was going to hurl them out through the open window the poor woman seized my arm and said in an irresistible tone sir leave that i beg you i beseech you her despair had doubtless become it seemed to so frantic that she was now overcome with tenderness toward that which had served her son the instrument of death and she wished to preserve it dear and horrible she took possession of the nail and of the twine at last at last all was accomplished there remained only to set myself back at work even more strenuously than usual to drive out gradually the little corpse that haunted the recesses of my brain the phantom of which wore out with its great ﬁxed eyes but the next day i received bundle of letters some from lodgers in the house several others from neighboring houses one from the ﬁrst ﬂoor another from the second another from the third and so throughout some in style though seeking to disguise beneath an apparent jocularity the sincerity of the request others grossly shameless and without spelling but all tending to the same goal namely to securing from bit of the fatal and beatiﬁc rope among the signers were i must say more women than men but not all i assure you belonged to the lowest class i have kept the letters and then suddenly light glowed in my brain and i understood why the mother was so very

playing were chatting away one said yesterday i was taken to the theatre in great sad palaces where in the background spread the sea and the sky men and women also serious and sad but much more beautiful and much better dressed than any we see about were talking with musical voices they threatened one another they entreated they were disconsolate and often they rested hand on dagger sunk within the sash ah that is beautiful indeed the women are much more beautiful and much greater than those that come to the house to visit us and although with their great hollow eyes and their ﬁery cheeks they have terrible look you can not help loving them you are afraid you want to cry and still you are content and then what is stranger still it all makes you want to be dressed the same to say and to the same things to speak with the same voice one of the four children who several moments had longer been listening to his comrade talk and had been watching with surprising ﬁxity some point or other in the sky said all at once look look down there you see him he is sitting on that little isolated cloud that little ﬁery cloud which is moving slowly he too they say he watches us who who asked the others god he answered with the accent of perfect ah he is already quite far away by and by you will not be able to see him doubtless he is traveling to visit every land look he is going to pass in back of that line of trees near the horizon and now he is going down behind the steeple ah you ca see him any longer and the child remained some time turned in the same direction ﬁxing on the line which separates earth from the sky eyes in which burned an inexpressible glow of ecstasy and regret he is fool that one with his good god whom he alone can see then said the third whose whole person was marked with singular vivacity and life i am going to tell you how something happened to which has never happened to you and which is little more interesting than your theatre and your clouds several days ago my parents took on trip with them and the inn where we stopped did have enough beds all of us it was decided that i should sleep in the same bed my nursery maid he drew his comrades quite close and spoke in lower tone that was strange performance now not to sleep alone and to be in bed with your maid in the dark i could sleep i amused myself while she was sleeping by passing my hand over her arms her neck and her shoulders she has much thicker neck and arm than all other women and her skin is so soft so soft that you might call it or silver paper i liked it so much that i should have kept on long time if i had been afraid afraid at ﬁrst of waking her and then still afraid of i know what then i buried my head in the hair which lay down her back thick mane and it smelled just good i assure you the ﬂowers in the garden right now try when you can to much and you will see the young author of this prodigious revelation in telling his story had his eyes wide open in sort of stupefaction at what he still felt and the rays of the setting sun slipping across the sandy locks of his rufﬂed hair illumined it like sulphurous aureole of passion it was easy to guess that this youngster would not lose his life seeking divinity in the clouds and that he would frequently discover it elsewhere at last the fourth spoke you know that i seldom ﬁnd amusement at home i am never taken to play my tutor is too stingy god does bother about and my ennui and i have pretty nurse to fondle it has often seemed to that i should just like to go forever straight ahead without knowing

keys of little piano hung by strap about his neck appeared to be mocking the plaint of his neighbor while from time to time the third clashed his cymbals with extraordinary violence they were so pleased with themselves that they went on playing their wild music even after the crowd had gone away finally they gathered together their sous piled their luggage on their back and left i wanted to know where they lived and i followed them from afar right to the edge of the forest and only then i understood that they lived nowhere then one said we pitch the tent answered the other such pleasant

brandy and went to sleep with his forehead toward the stars at ﬁrst i wanted to beg them to take along with them and to teach to play their instruments but i did dare doubtless because it is always very difﬁcult to come to decision about anything and also becau i was afraid of being recaptured before we were out of france the slightly interested air of the three other comrades made realize that this fellow was already misunderstood i looked at him closely there was in in his eye and on his brow that indescribable fatal precocity which generally repells sympathy and which i know not why
