philosophers in so far they have been dogmatists have failed to understand the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to truth have been unskilled and unseemly methods winning woman certainly she has never allowed herself to be won and at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien indeed it stands at all there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen that all dogma lies on the more that it is at its last gasp but to speak seriously there are good grounds hoping that all dogmatizing in philosoph y whatever solemn whatever conclusive and decided airs it has assumed may have been only noble puerilism and tyronism and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood wha t has actually sufﬁced the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical ediﬁces the dogmatists have hitherto reared perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time such the which in the form of and has not yet ceased doing mischief perhaps some play upon words deception on the part of grammar or an audacious generalization of very restricted very personal very facts the philosophy of the dogmatists it is to be hoped was only promise thousands of years afterwards was astrology in still earlier times in the service of which probably more labour gold acuteness and patience have been spent than on any actual science hitherto we owe to it and to its super pretensions in asia and egypt the grand style of architecture it seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with everlasting claims all great things have ﬁrst to wander about the earth enormous and inspiring caricatures dogmatic philosophy has been caricature of this instance the vedanta doctrine in asia and platonism in europe let us not be ungrateful to it although it beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https be confessed that the worst the most tiresome and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been dogmatist plato invention of pure spirit and the good in itself but now when it has been surmounted when europe rid of this nightmare can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy we whose duty is wakefulness itself are the heirs of all the strength which the struggle against this error has fostered it amounted to the very inversion of truth and the denial of the persp fundamental life to speak of spirit and the good plato spoke of them indeed one might ask physician how did such malady attack that ﬁnest product of antiquity plato had the wicked socrates really corrupted him was socrates after all corrupter of youths and deserved his hemlock but the struggle against plato speak plainer and the people struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of christianity christianity is platonism the people produced in europe magniﬁcent tensio n of soul such had not existed anywhere previously with such tensely strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals matter of fact the european feels this tension state of distress and twice attempts have been made in grand style to unbend the bow once by means of jesuitism and the second time by means of democratic which with the aid of liberty of the press and newspaper might in fact bring it about that the spirit would not so easily ﬁnd itself in distress the germans invented credit to them but they again made things invented printing but we who are neither jesuits nor democrats nor even sufﬁci ently germans we good europeans and free ver y free have it still all the distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow and perhaps also the arrow the duty and who knows the goal to aim at sils maria upper engadine june chapter prejudices of philosophers the will to truth which is to tempt us to many hazardous enterprise the famous truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect what questions has this will to truth not laid before us what strange perplexing questionable questions it is already long story yet it seems if it were hardly commenced is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful lose patience and turn impatiently away that this sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves who is it really that puts questions to us here wha t really is this will to truth in us in fact we made long halt at the question to the origin of this at last we came to an absolute standstill before yet more fundamental question we inquired about the value of this will granted that we want the truth why not rather untruth and uncertainty even ignorance the problem of the value of truth presented itself before was it we who presented ourselves before the problem which of us is the oedipus here which the sphinx it would seem to be rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation and could it be believed that it at last seems to us if the problem had never been propounded before if we were the ﬁrst to discern it get sight of it and risk raising it there is risk in raising it perhaps there is greater risk 2 how could anything originate out of its opposite example truth out of error or the will to truth out of the will to deception or the generous deed out of selﬁshness or the pure bright vision of the wise man out of covetousness such genesis is impossible whoever dreams of it is fool nay worse than fool things of the highest value must have different origin an origin of their this transitory seductive illusory paltry world in this turmoil of delusion and cupidity they can not have their source but rather in the lap of being in the intransitory in the concealed god in the must be their source and nowhere else beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which metaphysicians of all times can be recognized this mode of valuation is at the back of all their logical procedure through this belief of theirs they exert themselves their knowledge something that is in the end solemnly christened the truth the fundamental belief of metaphysicians is the belief in antitheses of values it never occurred even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold where doubt however was most necessary though they had made solemn vow omnibus dubit andum it may be doub ted ﬁrstly whether antitheses exist at all and secondly whether the popular valuations and antitheses of value upon which metaphys icians have set their seal are not perhaps merely superﬁcial estimates merely provisional perspec tives besides being probably made from some corner perha ps from frog perspectives it were to borrow an expression current among painters in spite of all the value which may belong to the true the positive and the unselﬁsh it might be possible that higher and more fundamental value life generally should be assigned to pretence to the will to delusion to selﬁshness and cupidity it might even be possible that wha t constitut es the value of those good and respected things consists precisely in their being insidiously related knotted and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed even in being essentially identical with them perhaps but who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous perhapses that investigation one must await the advent of new order of philosophers such will have other tastes and inclinations the reverse of those hitherto of the dangerous perhaps in every sense of the term and to speak in all seriousness i see such new philosophers beginning to appear having kept sharp eye on philosophers and having read between their lines long enough i now say to myself that the greater part of conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions and it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking one has here to learn anew one learned anew about heredity and innateness little the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process and procedure of heredity just little is opposed to the instinctive in any decisive sense the greater part of the conscious thinking of philosopher is secretly inﬂuenced by his instincts and forced into deﬁnite channels and behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement there are valuations or to speak more plainly physiological demands the maintenance of deﬁnite mode of life example that the certain is worth more than the uncertain that illusion is less valuable than truth such valuation s in spite of their regulative importance us might notwithstanding be only superﬁcial valuati ons special kinds of niaiserie such may be necessary the maintenance of beings such ourselves supposing in effect that man is not just the measure of things the falseness of an opinion is not us any objection to it it is here perhaps that our new language sounds most strangely the question is how far an opinion is preserving perhaps and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions to which the synthetic judgments priori belong are the most indispensable to us that without recognition of logical ﬁctions without comparison of reality with the purely imagined world of the absolute and immutable without constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers man could not the renunciation of false opinions would be renunciation of life negatio n of life to recognise untruth condition of life that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in dangerous manner and philosophy which ventures to so has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil that which causes philosophers to be regarded and is not the discovery how innocent they often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way in short how childish and childlike they are that there is not enough honest dealing with them whereas they all raise loud and virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in the remotest manner they all pose though their real opinions had been discovered and attained through the of cold pure divinely indifferent dialectic in contrast to all sorts of mystics who fairer and foolisher talk of inspiration whereas in fact prejudiced proposition idea or suggestion which is generally their heart desire abstracted and reﬁned is defended by them with arguments sought out after the event they are all advocates who not wish to be regarded such generally astute defenders also of their prejudices which they dub truths ver y far from having the conscience which bravely admits this to itself very far from having the good taste of the courage which goes so far to let this be understood perhaps to warn friend or foe or in cheerful conﬁdence and the spectacle of the tartuffery of old kant equally stiff and decent with which he entices us into the dialectic that beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https more correctly mislead to his categorical imperative us fastidious ones smile we who ﬁnd small amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical preachers or still more so the in mathematical form by means of which spinoza has it were clad his philosophy in mail and fact the love of his wisdom to translate the term fairly and order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart of the assailant who should dare to cast glance on that invincible maiden that pallas athene much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of sickly recluse betray it has gradually become clear to what every great philosophy up till now has consisted namely the confession of its origina tor and species of involuntary and unconscious biography and moreover that the moral or immoral purpose in every philos ophy has constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown indeed to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of philosopher have been arrived at it is always well and wise to ﬁrst ask oneself what morality they or does he aim at accordingly i not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy but that another impulse here elsewhere has only made use of knowledge and mistaken knowledge an instrument but whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with view to determining how far they may have here acted inspiring genii or demons and cobolds will ﬁnd that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another and that each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate lord over all the other impulses every impulse is imperious and such attempts to philosophize to be sure in the case of scholars in the case of really scientiﬁc men it may be better if you will there there may really be such thing an impulse to knowledge some kind of small independent work which when well wound up works away industriously to that end without the rest of the scholarly impulses taking any material part therein the actual interests of the scholar therefore are generally in quite another the family perhaps or in aking or in politics it is in fact almost indifferent at what point of research his little machine is placed and whether the hopeful young worker becomes good philologist mushroom specialist or chemist he is not characterised by becoming this or that in the philosopher on the contrary there is absolutely nothing impersonal and above all his morality furnishes decided and decisive testimony to who he is is to say in what order the deepest impulses of his nature stand to each other how malicious philosophers can be i know of nothing more stinging than the joke epicurus took the liberty of making on plato and the platonists he called them dionysiokolakes in its original sense and on the face of it the word signiﬁes flatterers of dionysius tyrants accessories and besides this however it is much to say they are all act ors there is nothing genuine about them dionysiokolax was popular name an actor and the latter is really the malignant reproach that epicurus cast upon plato he was annoyed by the grandiose manner the mise en scene style of which plato and his scholars were which epicurus was not master he the old of samos who sat concealed in his little garden at athens and wrote three hundred books perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of plato who knows greece took hundred years to ﬁnd out who the epicurus really was did she ever ﬁnd out there is point in every philosophy at which the conviction of the philosopher appears on the scene or to put it in the words of an ancient mystery adventavit asinus pulcher et fortissimus you desire to live according to nature oh you noble stoics what fraud of words imagine to yourselves being like nature boundlessly extravagant boundlessly indifferent without purpose or consideration without pity or justice at once fruitful and barren and uncertain imagine to yourselves indifference could you live in accordance with such indifference to not that just endeavouring to be otherwise than this nature is not living valuing preferring being unjust being limited endeavouring to be different and granted that your imperative living according to nature means actually the same living according to life could you differentl y why should you make principle out of what you yourselves are and must be in reality however it is quite otherwise with you while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in nature you want something quite the contrary you extraordinary and in your pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to nature to nature herself and to incorporate them therein you insist that it shall be nature according to the stoa and would like everything to be made after your own image vast eternal beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https generalism of stoicism with all your love truth you have forced yourselves so long so persistently and with such hypnotic rigidity to see nature falsel y that is to say stoically that you are longer able to see it to crown all some unfathomable superciliousness gives you the bedlamite hope that because you are able to tyrannize over is will also allow herself to be tyrannized over is not the stoic part of nature but this is an old and everlas ting story what happened in old times with the stoics still happens today soon ever philoso phy begins to believe in itself it always creates the world in its own image it can not otherwise philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself the most spiritual will to power the will to creation of the world the will to the causa prima the eagerness and subtlety i should even say craftiness with which the problem of the real and the apparent world is dealt with at present throughout europe furnishes food thought and attention and he who hears only will to truth in the background and nothing else can not certainly boast of the sharpest ears in rare and isolated cases it may really have happened that such will to certain extravagant and adventurous pluck metaphysici an ambition of the forlorn participated therein that which in the end always prefers handful of certainty to whole cartload of beautiful possibilities there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience who prefer to put their last trust in sure nothing rather than in an uncertain something but that is nihilism and the sign of despairing mortally wearied soul notwithstand ing the courageous bearing such virtue may display it seems however to be otherwise with stronger and livelier thinkers who are still eager life in that they side against appearance and speak superciliously of perspective in that they rank the credibility of their own bodies about low the credibility of the ocular evidence that the earth stands still and thus apparently allowing with complacency their securest possession to escape what does one at present believe in more ﬁrmly than in one body knows if they are not really trying to win back something which was formerly an even securer possession something of the old domain of the faith of former times perhaps the immortal soul perhaps the old god in short ideas by which they could live better that is to say more vigorously and more joyously than by modern ideas there is distrust of these modern ideas in this mode of looking at things disbelief in all that has been constructed yesterday and today there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety and scorn which can longer endure the of ideas of the most varied origin such positivism at present throws on the market disgust of the more reﬁned taste at the motleyness and patchiness of all these in whom there is nothing either new or true except this motleyness therein it seems to that we shoul d agree with those skeptical and microscopists of the present day their instinct which repels them from modern reality is unrefuted what their retrograde concern us the main thing about them is not that they wish to go back but that they wish to get away therefrom little more strength swing courage and artistic power and they would be not back it seems to that there is everywhere an attempt at present to divert attenti on from the actual inﬂuence which kant exercised on german philosophy and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself kant was ﬁrst and foremost proud of his table of categories with it in his hand he said this is the most difﬁcult thing that could ever be unde rtaken on behalf of metaphysics let us only understand this could be he was proud of having discovered new faculty in man the faculty of synthetic judgment priori granting that he deceived himself in this matter the development and rapid ﬂourishing of german philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride and on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible all events new faculties which to be still prouder let us reﬂect is high time to so how are synthetic judgments priori possible kant asks what is really his answer by means of means faculty unfortunately not in ﬁve words but so circumstantially imposingly and with such display of german profundity and verbal ﬂourishes that one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer people were beside themselves with delight over this new faculty and the jubilation reached its climax when kant further discovered moral faculty in at that time germans were still moral not yet dabbling in the politics of hard fact then came the honeymoon of german philosophy all the young theologians of the tubingen institution went immediately into the seeking faculties and what did they not that innocent rich and still youthful period of the german spirit to which romanticism the malicious fairy piped and sang when one could not yet distinguish between ﬁnding and inventing above all faculty the transcendental beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https christened it intellectual intuition and thereby gratiﬁed the most earnest longings of the naturally germans one can greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement which was really youthfulness notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly in hoary and senile conceptions than to take it seriously or even treat it with moral indignation enough world grew older and the dream vanished time came when people rubbed their foreheads and they still rub them today people had been dreaming and ﬁrst and kant by means of means faculty had said or at least meant to say but is answer an explanation or is it not rather merely repetition of the question how does opium induce sleep by means of means faculty namely the virtus dormitiva replies the doctor in moliere quia est in eo virtus dormitiva cujus est natura sensus assoupire but such replies belong to the realm of comedy and it is high time to replace the kantian question how are synthetic judgments priori possible by another question why is belief in such judgments necessary effect it is high time that we should understand that such judgments must be believed to be true the sake of the preservation of creatures like ourselves though they still might naturally be false judgments or more plainly spoken and roughly and judgments priori should not be possible at all we have right to them in our mouths they are nothing but false judgments only of course the belief in their truth is necessary plausible belief and ocula r evidence belonging to the perspectiv view of life and ﬁnally to call to mind the enormous inﬂuence which german philosophy hope you understand its right to inverted commas goosefeet exercised throughout the whole of europe there is doubt that certain virtus dormitiv had share in it thanks to germa n philosophy it was delight to the noble idlers the virtuous the mystics the artiste the christians and the political obscurantists of all nation s to ﬁnd an antidote to the still overwhelming sensualism which overﬂowed from the last century into this in sensus regards materialistic atomism it is one of the theories that have been advanced and in europe there is now perhaps one in the learned world so unscholarly to attach serious signiﬁcation to it except convenient everyday use an abbreviation of the means of expression chieﬂy to the pole boscovich he and the pole copernicus have hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponents of ocular evidence while copernicus has persuaded us to believe contrary to all the senses that the earth does not stand fast boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that stood fast of the belief in substance in matter in the and it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth one must however go still further and also declare war relentless war to the knife against the atomistic requirements which still lead dangerous in places where one suspects them like the more celebrated metaphysical requirements one must also above all give the ﬁnishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which christianity has taught best and longest the tomism let it be permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the soul something indestructible eternal indivisible monad an atomon this belief ought to be expelled from science between ourselves it is not at all necessary to get rid of the soul thereby and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists who can hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it but the way is open new acceptations and reﬁnements of the hypothesis and such conceptions mortal soul and soul of subjective multiplicity and soul social structure of the instincts and passions want henceforth to have legitimate rights in science in that the new psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have hitherto ﬂourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of the soul he is really it were thrusting himself into new desert and new t is possible that the older psychologists had merrier and more comfortable time of it eventua lly however he ﬁnds that precisely thereby he is also condemned to who knows perhaps to discover the new psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the instinct of the cardinal instinct of an organic being living thing seeks above all to discharge its itself is will to power is only one of the indirect and most frequent resul ts thereof in short here everywhere else let us beware of superfluous teleological principles of which is the instinct of we owe it to beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https it is thus in effect that method ordains which must be essentially economy of principles it is perhaps just dawning on ﬁve or six minds that natural philosophy is only exposition and according to us if i may say so and not but in so far it is based on belief in the senses it is regarded more and long time to come must be regarded an explanation it has eyes and ﬁngers of its own it has ocular evidence and palpableness of its own this operates fascinatingly persuasively and convincingl y upon an age with fundamentally plebeian fact it follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism what is clear what is explained only that which can be seen and must pursue every problem thus far obversely however the charm of the platonic mode of thought which was an arist ocra tic mode consisted precisely in resist ance to obvious among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our contem poraries but who knew how to ﬁnd higher triumph in remaining masters of them and this by means of pale cold grey conceptional networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the mob of the senses plato said in this overcoming of the world and interpreting of the world in the manner of plato there was an enjoyment different from that which the physicist s of today offer likewise the darwinists and teleologists among the physiological workers with their principle of the smallest possible effort and the greatest possible blunder where there is nothing more to see or to grasp there is also nothing more men to is certainly an imperative different from the platonic one but it may notwithstanding be the right imperative hardy laborious race of machinists and builders of the future who have nothing but rough work to perform to study physiology with clear conscience one must insist on the fact that the gans are not phenomena in the sense of the idealistic philosophy such they certainly could not be causes sensualism therefore at least regulative hypothesis if not heuristic principle what and others say even that the external world is the work of our organs but then our body part of this external world would be the work of our organs but then our organs themselves would be the work of our organs it seems to that this is complete reductio ad absurdum if the conception causa sui is something fundamentally absurd consequently the external world is not the work of our or there are still harmless who believe that there are immediate certainties instance i think or the superstition of schopenhauer puts it i will though cognition here got hold of its object purely and simply the thing in itself without any falsiﬁcation taking place either on the part of the subject or the object i would repeat it however hundred times that immediate certainty well absolute knowledge and the thing in itself involve contradictio in adject we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading signiﬁcance of words the people on their part may think that cognition is knowing all about things but the philosopher must say to himself when i analyze the process that is expressed in the sentence i think i ﬁnd whole series of daring assertions the argumentative proof of which would be difﬁcult perhaps impossible instance that it is i who think that there must necessarily be something that thinks that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of being who is thought of cause that there is an and ﬁnally that it is already determined what is to be designated by that i know what thinking is if i had not already decided within myself what it is by what standard could i determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps or in short the assertion i think assumes that i comp are my state at the present moment with other states of myself which i know in order to determine what it is on account of this retrospective connection with further it has at any rate immediate certainty place of the immediate certainty in which the people may believe in the special case the philosopher thus ﬁnds series of metaphysical question s presented to him veritable conscien ce questions of the intellect to wit whence did i get the notion of why i believe in cause and effect what gives the right to speak of an and even of an cause and ﬁnally of an cause of thought he who ventures to answer these metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to sort of intuitive perception like the person who says i think and know that this at least is true actual and certain encounter smile and two notes of interrogation in philosopher nowadays sir the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand it is improbable that you are not mistaken but why should it be the truth beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https with regard to the superstitions of logicians i shall never tire of emphasizing small terse fact which is unwillingly recognized by these credulous that thought comes when it wishes and not when i wish so that it is perversion of the facts of the case to say that the subject i is the condition of the predicate think one thinks but that this one is precisely the famous old ego is to put it mildly only supposition an assertion and assuredly not an immediate certainty after all one has even gone too far with this one thinks the one contains an interpret ation of the process and does not belong to the process itself one infers here according to the usual grammatical t think is an activity every activity requires an agency that is active consequently it was pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought besides the operating power the material particle wherein it resides and out of which it atom more rigorous minds however learnt at last to get along without this residuum and perhaps some day we shall accustom ourselves even from the logician point of view to get along without the little one to which the worthy old ego has reﬁned itself it is certainly not the least charm of theory that it is refutable it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle minds it seems that the theory of the free will owes its persistence to this charm alone some one is always appearing who feels himself strong enough to refute it philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will though it were the thing in the world indeed schopenhauer has given us to understand that the will alone is really known to us absolutely and completely known without deduction or addition but it again and again seems to that in this case schopenhauer also only did what philosophers are in the habit of seems to have adopted popular prejudice and exaggerated it willing seems to to be above all something complica ted something that is unity only in it is precisely in name that popular prejudice lurks which has got the mastery over the inadeq uate precautions of philosophers in all ages so let us once be more cautious let us be unphilosophical let us say that in all willing there is ﬁrstly plurality of sensations namely the sensation of the condition away from which we go the sensation of the condition towards which we go the sensation of this from and towards itself and then besides an accompanying muscular sensation which even without our putting in motion arms and legs commenc es its action by force of habit directly we will anything therefore just sensations and indeed many kinds of sensations are to be recognized ingredients of the will so in the second place thinking is also to be recognized in every act of the will there is ruling thought let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from the willing if the will would then remain over in the third place the will is not only complex of sensation and thinking but it is above all an emotion and in fact the emotion of the command that which is termed freedom of the will is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey i am free must obey consciousness is inherent in every will and equally so the straining of the attention the straight look which ﬁxes itself exclusively on one thing the unconditional judgment that this and nothing else is necessary now the inward certainty that obedience will be whatever else pertains to the position of the commander man who wills commands something within himself which renders obedience or which he believes renders obedience but now let us notice what is the strangest thing about the will affair so extremely complex which the people have only one name inasmuch in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding and the obeying parties and the obeying party we know the sensations of constraint impulsion pressure resistance and motion which usually commence immediately after the act of will inasmuch on the other hand we are accustomed to disregard this duality and to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term i whol series of erroneous conclusions and consequently of false judgments about the will itself has become attached to the act of such degree that he who wills believes ﬁrmly that willing suffices action since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will when the effect of the obedience and therefore to be expected the appearance has translated itself into the sentiment if there were necessity of effect in word he who wills believes with fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow one he ascribes the success the carrying out of the willing to the will itself and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success freedom of will is the expression the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition who commands and at the same time identiﬁes himself with the executor of the such enjoys also the triumph over obstacles but thinks beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https that it was really his own will that overcame them in this way the perso n exercising volition adds the feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments the useful underwills or under our body is but social structure composed of many his feelings of delight commander moi what happens here is what happens in every and happy commonwealth namely that the governing class identiﬁes itself with the successes of the commonwealth in all willing it is absolutely question of commanding and obeying on the basis already said of social structure composed of many souls on which account philosopher should claim the right to include within the sphere of the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of life manifests itself that the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or autonomously evolving but grow up in connection and relationship with each other that however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of though t they nevertheless belong just much to system the collective members of the fauna of betrayed in the end by the circumstance how unfailingly the most diverse philosophers always ﬁll in again deﬁnite fundamental scheme of possible philosophies under an invisible spell they always revolve once more in the same orbit however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills something within them leads them something impels them in deﬁnite order the one after the to wit the innate methodology and relationship of their ideas their thinking is in fact far less discovery than remembering return and to ancient of the soul out of which those ideas formerly grew philosophizing is so far kind of atavism of the highest order the wonderful family resemblance of all indian greek and german philosophizing is easily enough explained in fact where there is afﬁnity of language owing to the common philosophy of mean owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical can not but be that everything is prepared at the outset similar development and successi on of philosophical systems just the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of it is highly probable that philosophers within the domain of the languages where the conception of the subject is least developed look otherwise into the world and will be found on paths of thought different from those of the and mussulmans the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately also the spell of physiological valuations and racial much by way of rejecting locke superﬁciality with regard to the origin of ideas the causa sui is the best that has yet been conceived it is sort of logical violation and unnaturalness but the extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with this very folly the desire freedom of will in the superlative metaphysical sense such still holds sway unfortunately in the minds of the the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility one actions oneself and to absolve god the world ancestors chance and society therefrom involves nothing less than to be precisely this causa sui and with more than munchausen daring to pull oneself up into existence by the hair out of the slough of nothingness if any one should ﬁnd out in this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of free will and put it out of his head altogether i beg of him to carry his enlightenment step further and also put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception of free will i mean will which is tantamount to misuse of cause and effect one should not wrongly materialise cause and effect the natural philosophers and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at present according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it effects its end one should use cause and effect only pure conceptions that is to say conventional ﬁctions the purpose of designation and mutual understanding not explanation in there is nothing of of necessity or of psychological there the effect does not follow the cause there law does not obtain it is we alone who have devised cause sequence reciprocity relativity constraint number law freedom motive and purpose and when we interpret and intermix this orld with things we act once more we have always the will is mythology in real life it is only question of strong and weak is almost always symptom of what is lacking in himself when thinker in every and psychological necessity manifests something of compulsion indigence obsequiousness oppression and it is suspicious to have such person betrays himself and in general if i have observed correctly the of the will is regarded problem from two entirely opposite standpoints beyond good

books are in the habit at present of taking the side of criminals sort of socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise and matter of fact the fatalism of the willed embellishes itself surprisingly when it can pose la religion la souffrance humaine that is its good taste let be pardoned an old philologist who can not desist from the misc hief of putting his ﬁnger on bad modes of interpretation but nature conformity to law of which you physicists talk so proudly it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad philology it is matter of fact text but rather just naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning with which you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern soul everywhere equality before the is not different in that respect nor better than we ﬁne instance of secret motive in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and second and more reﬁned once more disguised ni dieu ni maitre also is what you want and therefore cheers natural law it not so but has been said that is interpretation not text and somebody might come along who with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation could read out of the same nature and with regard to the same phenomena just the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims of interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and unconditi onalness of all will to power before your eyes that almost every word and the word tyranny itself would eventually seem unsuitable or like weakening and softening being too human and who should nevertheless end by asserting the same about this world you namely that it has necessary and calculable course not however because laws obtain in it but because they are absolutely lacking and every power effects its ultimate consequences every moment granted that this also is only you will be eager enough to make this objection so much the better all psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and timidities it has not dared to launch out into the depths in so far it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent it seems if nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology the morphology and development of the will to power i conceive of it the power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most intellectual world the world apparently most indifferent and unprejudiced and has obviously operated in an injurious obstructive blinding and distorting manner prope r has to contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator it has the heart against it even doctrine of the reciprocal conditionalness of the good and the bad impulses causes reﬁned immorality distress and aversion in still strong and manly more so doctrine of the derivation of all good impulses from bad ones if however person should regard even the emotions of hatred envy covetousness and imperiousness emotions factors which must be present fundamentally and essentially in the general economy of life which must therefore be further developed if life is to be further developed he will suffer from such view of things from and yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous knowledge and there are in fact hundred good reasons why every one should keep away from it who can so on the other hand if one has once drifted hither with one bark well very good now let us set our teeth ﬁrmly let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm we sail away right over morality we crush out we destroy perhaps the remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither what we matter never yet did profounder world of insight reveal itself to daring travelers and adventurers and the psych ologist who thus makes sacriﬁce t is not the sacriﬁzio dell intelletto on the contrary at least be entitled to demand in return that psychology shall once more be recognized the queen of the sciences whose service and equipment the other sciences exist psychology is once more the path to the fundamental beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https ii the free spirit sancta simplicitas in what strange simpliﬁcation and falsiﬁcation man lives one can never cease wondering when once one has got eyes beholding this marvel how we have made everything around us clear and free and easy and simple how we have been able to give our senses passport to everything superﬁcial our thoughts godlike desire wanton pranks and wrong inferences from the beginning we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost inconceivable freedom though tlessness imprudence heartiness and order to enjoy life and only on this solidiﬁed foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself hitherto the will to knowledge on the foundation of far more powerful will the will to ignorance to the uncertain to the untrue not its opposite its reﬁnement it is to be hoped indeed that language here elsewhere will not get over its awkwardness and that it will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees and many reﬁnements of gradation it is equally to be hoped that the incarnated tartuffery of morals which now belongs to our unconquerable ﬂesh and blood will turn the words round in the mouths of us discerning ones here and there we understand it and laugh at the way in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this simplified thoroughly artiﬁcial suitably imagined and suitably falsiﬁed world at the way in which whether it will or not it loves error because living itself it loves life after such cheerful commencement serious word would fain be heard it appeals to the most serious minds take care ye philosophers and friends of knowledge and beware of martyrdom of suffering the truth sake even in your own defense it spoils all the innocence and ﬁne neutrality of your conscience it makes you headstrong against objections and red rags it stupeﬁes animalizes and brutalizes when in the struggle with danger slander suspicion expulsion and even worse consequences of enmity ye have at last to play your last card protectors of truth upon though the truth were such an innocent and incompetent creature to require protectors and you of all people ye knights of the sorrowful countenance messrs loafers and of the spirit finally ye know sufﬁciently well that it can not be of any consequence if ye just carry your point ye know that hitherto philosopher has carried his point and that there might be more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines and occasionally after yourselves than in all the solemn pantomime and trumping games before accusers and rather go out of the way flee into concealment and have your masks and your ruses that ye may be mistaken what you are or somewhat feared and pray forget the garden the garden with golden and have people around you who are music on the waters at eventide when already the day becomes memory choose the good solitude the free wanton lightsome solitude which also gives you the right still to remain good in any sense whatsoever how poisonous how crafty how bad does every long war make one which can not be waged openly by means of force how personal does long fear make one long watching of enemies of possible enemies these pariahs of society these the compulsory recluses the spinozas or giordano become in the end even under the most intellectual masquerade and perhaps without being themselves aware of it reﬁned seekers and just lay bare the foundation of spinoza ethics and theology not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation which is the unfailing sign in philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him the martyrdom of the philosopher his sacriﬁce the sake of truth forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity with regard to many philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous desire to see him also in his deterioration deteriorated into martyr into only that it is necessary with such desire to be clear wha t spectacle one will see in any satyric play merely an epilogue farce merely the continued proof that the long real tragedy is at an end supposing that every philosophy has been long tragedy in its origin every select man strives instinctivel y citadel and privacy where he is free from the crowd the many the he may forget men who are the rule their exception exclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by still stronger instinct discerner in the great and exception al sense whoever in intercourse with men does not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours of distress owing to disgu st satiety sympathy gloominess and solitariness is assuredly not man of elevated tastes supposing however that beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https not voluntarily take all this burden and disgust upon himself that he persistently avoids it and remains i said quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel one thing is then certain he was not made he was not predestined knowledge such he would one day have to say to himself the devil take my good taste but rule is more interesting than the myself the exception and he would go down and above all he would go inside the long and serious study of the average consequently much disguise familiarity and bad intercourse all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one equals constitutes necessary part of the of every philosopher perhaps the most disag reeable odious and disappointing part if he is fortunate however favourite child of knowledge should be he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and lighten his task i mean cynics those who simply recognize the animal the commonplace and the rule in themselves and at the same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness to make them talk of themselves and their like before they wallow even in books on their own cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach what is called honesty and the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or ﬁner cynicism and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him or the scientiﬁc satyr speaks out there are even cases where enchantment mixes with the where by freak of nature genius is bound to some such indiscreet and ape in the case of the abbe galiani the profoundest acutest and perhaps also ﬁlthiest man of his was far profounder than voltair and consequently also good deal more silent it happens more frequently has been hinted that scientiﬁc head is placed on an ape body ﬁne exceptional understanding in base soul an occurrence by means rare especially among doctors and moral physiologists and whenever anyone speaks without bitterness or rather quite innocently of man belly with two requirements and head with one whenever any one sees seeks and wants to see only hunger sexual instinct and vanity the real and only motives of human actions in short when any one speaks badly not even ill man then ought the lover of knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently he ought in general to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation the indignant man and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with his own teeth or in place of himself the world god or society may indeed morally speaking stand higher than the laughing and satyr but in every other sense he is the more ordinary more indifferent and less instructive case and one is such liar the indignant man it is difﬁcult to be understood especially when one thinks and lives gangasrotogati footnote like the river ganges presto among those only who think and live kurmagati footnote like the tortoise lento or at best froglike mandeikagati foot note like the frog staccato i everything to be difﬁcultly understood myself one should be heartily grateful the good will to some reﬁnement of interpretation regards the good friends however who are always too and think that friends they have right to ease one does well at the very ﬁrst to grant them and can thus laugh still or get rid of them altogether these good laugh then also what is most difﬁcult to render from one language into another is the tempo of its style which has its basis in the character of the race or to speak more physiologically in the average tempo of the assimilation of its nutriment there are honestly meant translations which involuntary vulgarizations are almost falsiﬁcations of the original merely because its lively and merry tempo which overleaps and obviates all dangers in word and expression could not also be rendered german is almost incapacita ted prest in his language consequently also may be reasonably inferred many of the most delightful and daring nuances of free thought and just the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience so aristophanes and petronius are untranslatable him everything ponderous viscous and pompously clumsy all and wearying species of style are develop ed in profuse variety among stating the fact that even goethe prose in its mixture of stiffness and elegance is exception reﬂection of the good old time to which it belongs and an expression of german taste at time when there was still german taste which was taste in moribus et artibus lessing is an exception owing to his histrionic nature which understood much and was versed in many things he who was not the translator of bayle to purpose who took refuge willingly in the shadow of diderot and voltaire and still more willingly among the roman loved also in the tempo and ﬂight out of germany but how could the german language even in the prose of lessing imitate the tempo beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https who in his principe makes us breathe the dry ﬁne air of florence and can not help presenting the most serious events in boisterous allegrissimo perhaps not without malicious artistic sense of the contrast he ventures to heavy difﬁcult dangerous thoughts and tempo of the gallop and of the best wantonest humour finally who would venture on german translation of petronius who more than any great musician hitherto was master of prest in invention ideas and words what matter in the end about the swamps of the sick evil world or of the ancient world when like him one has the feet of wind the rush the breath the emancipating scorn of wind which makes everything healthy by making everything run and with regard to transﬁguring complementary genius whose sake one pardons all hellenism having existed provided one has understood in its full profun dity all that there requires pardon and transﬁguration there is nothing that has caused to meditate more on plato secrecy and nature than the happily preserved petit fait that under the pillow of his there was found bible nor anything egyptian pythagorean or book of aristophanes how could even plato have endured greek life which he without an aristophanes it is the business of the very few to be independent it is privilege of the strong and whoever attempts it even with the best right but without being obliged to so proves that he is probably not only strong but also daring beyond measure he enters into labyrinth he multiplies thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already brings with it not the least of which is that one can see how and where he loses his way becomes isolated and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience supposing such one comes to grief it is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it nor sympathize with it and he can not any longer go back he can not even go back again to the sympathy of men our deepest insights follies and under certain circumstances crimes when they come unauthorizedly to the ears of those who are not dispo sed and predestined them the exoteric and the esoteric they were formerly distinguished by among the indians among the greeks persians and mussulmans in short wherever people believed in gradations of rank and not in equality and equal not so much in contradistinction to one another in respect to the exoteric class standing without and viewing estimating measuring and judging from the outside and not from the inside the more essential distinction is that the class in question views things from below the esoteric class views things from above downw ards there are heights of the soul from which tragedy itself longer appears to operate tragically and if all the woe in the world were taken together who would dare to decide whether the sight of it would necessaril y seduce and constrain to sympathy and thus to doubling of the woe that which serves the higher class of men nourishment or refreshment must be almost poison to an entirely different and lower order of human beings the virtues of the common man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in philosopher it might be possible highly developed man supposing him to degenerate and go to ruin to acquire qualities thereby alone the sake of which he would have to be honoured saint in the lower world into which he had sunk there are books which have an inverse value the soul and the health according the inferior soul and the lower vitality or the higher and more powerful make use of them in the former case they are dangerous disturbing unsettling books in the latter case they are which summon the bravest to their bravery books the general reader are always books the odour of paltry people clings to them where the populace eat and drink and even where they reverence it is accustomed to stink one should not go into churches if one wishes to breathe pure air in our youthful years we still venera and despise without the art of nuan ce which is the best gain of life and we have rightly to hard penance having fallen upon men and things with yea and nay everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes the taste the unconditional is cruelly befooled and abused until man learns to intro duce little art into his sentiments and prefers to try conclusions with the artiﬁcial the real artists of life the angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself peace until it has suitably falsiﬁed men and things to be able to vent its passion upon them youth in itself even is something falsifying and deceptive later on when the young soul tortured by continual disillusions ﬁnally turns suspiciously against ardent and savage even in its suspic ion and remorse of conscience how it upbraids itself how impatiently it tears itself how it revenges itself its long though it had been voluntary blindness in this transition one punishes oneself beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https of one sentiments one tortures one enthusiasm with doubt one feels even the good conscience to be danger if it were the and lassitude of more reﬁned uprightness and above all one espouses upon principle the cause against youth decade later and one comprehends that all this was also throughout the longest period of human calls it the prehis toric value or of an action was inferred from its consequences the action in itself was not taken into consideration any more than its origin but pretty much in china at present where the distinction or disgrace of child redounds to its parents the power of success or failure was what induced men to think well or ill of an action let us call this period the moral period of mankind the imperative know thyself was then still the last ten thousand years on the other hand on certain large portions of the earth one has gradually got so far that one longer lets the consequ ences of an action but its origin decid with regard to its worth great achievement whole an important reﬁnement of vision and of criterion the unconscious effect of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in origin the mark of period which may be designated in the narrower sense the moral one the ﬁrst attempt at knowledge is thereby made instead of the consequences the an inversion of perspective and assuredly an inversion effected only after long struggle and wavering to be sure an ominous new superstition peculiar narrowness of interpretation attained supremacy precisely thereby the origin of an action was interpreted in the most deﬁnite sense possibl origin out of an intention people were agreed in the belief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention the intention the sole origin and antecedent history of an action under the inﬂuence of this prejudice moral praise and blam have been bestowed and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the present it not possible however that the necessity may now have arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversing and fundamental shifting of values owing to new and acuteness in it not possible that we may be standing on the threshold of period which to begin with would be distinguished negatively nowadays when at least among us immoralists the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely in that which is not intentional and that all its intentionalness all that is seen sensible or sensed in it belongs to its surface or like every skin betrays something but conceals still more in short we believe that the intention is only sign or symptom which ﬁrst requires an sign moreover which has too many interpretations and consequently hardly any meaning in itself alone that morality in the sense in which it has been understood hitherto has been prejudice perhaps prematureness or preliminariness proba bly something of the same rank astrology and alchemy but in any case something which must be surmounted the surmounting of morality in certain sense even the of that be the name the labour which has been reserved the most reﬁned the most upright and also the most wicked consciences of today the living touchstones of the soul it can not be helped the sentiment of surrender of sacriﬁce one neighbour and all must be merciles sly called to account and brought to judgment just the aesthetics of disinterested contemplation under which the emasculation of art nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself good conscience there is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments others and not myself one not needing to be doubly distrustful here and one asking promptly are they not they who has them and him who enjoys their fruit and also the mere t is still argument in their f avour but just calls caution let us therefore be cautious at whatever standpoint of philoso phy one may place oneself nowadays seen from every position the erroneousness of the world in which we think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light upon we ﬁnd proof after proof thereof which would fain allure us into surmises concerning deceptive principle in the nature of things he however who makes thinking itself and consequently the spirit responsible the falseness of the honourable exit which every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself who regards this world including space time form and movement falsely deduced would have at least good reason in the end to become distrustful also of all thinking has it not hitherto been playing upon us the worst of scurvy tricks and what guarantee would it give that it would not continue to what it has always been doing in all seriousness the innocence of thinkers has something touching and ng in it which even nowadays permits them to wait beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https with the request that it will give them honest answers example whether it be real or not and why it keeps the outer world so resolutely at distance and other questions of the same description the belief in immediate certainties is moral naivete which does honour to us philosophers have now to cease being merel y moral men apart from morality such belief is folly which does little honour to us if in life an distrust is regarded the sign of bad charac ter and consequently an imprudence here among us beyond the world and its yeas and nays what should prevent our being imprudent and saying the philosopher has at length right to bad character the being who has hitherto been most befooled on is now under obliga tion to distrustfulnes s to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of give the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of expression i myself have long ago learned to think and estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived and i keep at least couple of pokes in the ribs ready the blind rage with which philosophers struggle against being deceived why not it is nothing more than moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance it is in fact the worst proved supposition in the world so much must be conceded there could have been life at all except upon the basis of perspective estimates and semblances and if with the virtuous enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers one wished to away altogether with the seeming world ll granted that you could that least nothing of your truth would thereby remain indeed what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an essential opposition of true and false is it not enough to suppose degrees of seemingness and it were lighter and darker shades and tones of ferent valeurs the painters say why might not the world which concerns ﬁction and to any one who suggested but to ﬁction belongs an originator it not be bluntly replied why may not this belong also belong to the ﬁction is it not at length permitted to be little ironical towards the subject just towards the predicate and object might not the philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar all respect to governesses but is it not time that philosophy should renounce voltaire humanity idiocy there is something ticklish in the truth and in the search the truth and if man goes about it too il ne cherche le vrai pour faire le bien wager he ﬁnds nothing supposing that nothing else is given real but our world of desires and passions that we can not sink or rise to any other reality but just that of our think ing is only relation of these impulses to one another we not permitted to make the attempt and to ask the question whether this which is given does not suffice by means of our counterparts the understanding even of the mechanical or material world i not mean an illusion semblance representation in the berkeleyan and schopenhauerian sense but possessing the same degree of reality our emotions more primitive form of the world of emotions in which everything still lies locked in mighty unity which afterwards branches off and develops itself in organic processes naturally also reﬁnes and debilitates kind of instinctive life in which all organic functions including assimilation nutrition secretion and change of matter are still synthetically united with one primar y form of life in the end it is not only permitted to make this attempt it is commanded by the conscience of logical method not to assume several kinds of causality so long the attempt to get along with single one has not been pushed to its furthest extent to absurdity if i may be allowed to say so that is morality of method whic h one may not repudiate follows from its deﬁnition mathematicians say the question is ultimately whether we really recognize the will opera ting whether we believe in the causality of the will if we fundamentally our belief in this is just our belief in causality must make the attempt to posit hypothetically the causality of the will the only causality will can naturally only operate on will not on matter not on nerves instance in short the hypothesis must be hazarded whether will does not operate on will wherever effects are whether all mechanical action inasmuch powe r operates therein is not just the power of will the effect of will granted ﬁnally that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life the development and ramiﬁcation of one fundamental form of the will to power my thesis puts it granted that all organic functions could be traced back to this will to power and that the solution of the problem of generation and it is one also be found therein one would thus have acquired the right to deﬁne all active force unequivocally will to power beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https seen from within the world deﬁned and designated according to its intelligible character would simply be w ill to power and nothing else 37 what does not that mean in popular language god is disproved but not the devil the contrary on the contrary my friends and who the devil also compels you to speak popularly happened ﬁnally in all the enligh tenment of modern times with the french revolution that terrible farce quite superﬂuous when judged close at hand into which however the noble and visionary spectators of all europe have interpreted from distance their own indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately until the text has disappeared under the interpret ation so noble posterity might once more misunderstand the whole of the past and perhaps only thereby make its aspect rather has not this already happened have not we ourselves nobl posterity and in so far we now comprehend this is it already past nobody will very readily regard doctrine true merely because it makes people happy or perhaps the amiable idealists who are enthusiastic about the good true and beautiful and let all kinds of motley coarse and desirabilities swim about promiscuously in their pond happiness and virtue are arguments it is willingly forgotten however even on the part of thoughtful minds that to make unhappy and to make bad are just little counter thing could be true although it were in the highest degree injurious and dangerous indeed the fundamental constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by full knowledge of that the strength of mind might be measured by the amount of truth it could to speak more plainly by the extent to which it requir ed truth attenuated veiled sweetened damped and falsiﬁed but there is doubt that the discovery of certain tions of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably situated and have greater likelihood of success not to speak of the wicked who are species about whom moralists are silent perhaps severity and craft are more favourable conditions the development of strong independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle reﬁned yielding and habit of taking things easily which are prized and rightly prized in learned man presupposing always to begin with that the term philosopher be not conﬁned to the philosopher who writes books or even introduces his philosophy into books furnishes last feature of the portrait of the spirited philosopher which the sake of german taste i will not omit to it is opposed to german taste pour etre bon philosophe says this last great psychologist il faut etre sec clair sans illusion un banquier qui fait fortune une partie du caractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie pour voir clair dans ce qui est everything that is profound loves the mask the profoundest things have hatred even of ﬁgure and likeness should not the contrar y only be the right disguise the shame of god to go about in question worth asking would be strange if some mystic has not already ventured on the same kind of thing there are proceedings of such delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness and make them unrecognizable there are actio ns of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take stick and thrash the witness soundly one thereby obscures his recollection many one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory in order at least to have vengea nce on this sole party in the secret shame is inventive they are not the worst things of which one is most ashamed there is not only deceit behind is so much goodness in craft i could imagine that man with something costly and fragile to conceal would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like an old green the reﬁnement of his shame requiring it to be so man who has depths in his shame meets his destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate friends may be ignorant his mortal danger conceals itself from their eyes and equally so his regained security such hidden nature which instinctively employs speech silence and concealment and is inexhaustible in evasion of communication desires and insists that mask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his friends and supposing he does not desire it his eyes will some day be opened to the fact that there is nevertheless mask of him that it is well to be so every profound spirit needs mask nay more around every profound spirit there continually grows mask owing to the constantly false that is to say superficial interpretation of every word he utters every step he takes every sign of life he manifests one must subject oneself to one own tests that one is destined independence and command and so at the right time one must not avoid one tests

deal prodigally almost indifferently with themselves and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes vice one must know how to conser ve best test of independence new order of philosophers is appearing i shall venture to baptize them by name not without danger far i understand them far they allow themselves to be it is their nature to wish to remain something of philosophers of the future might rightly perhaps also wrongly claim to be designated tempters this name itself is after all only an attempt or if it be preferred temptation will they be new friends of truth these coming philosophers very probably all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths but assuredly they will not be dogmatists it must be contrary to their pride and also contrary to their taste that their truth should still be truth every which has hitherto been the secret wish and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts my opinion is my opinion another person has not easily right to it philosopher of the future will say perhaps one must renounce the bad taste of wishing to agree with many people good is longer good when one neighbour takes it into his mouth and how could there be common good the expression contradicts itself that which can be common is always of small value in the end things must be they are and have always great things remain the great the abysses the profound the delicacies and thrills the reﬁned and to sum up shortly everything rare the rare need i say expressly after all this that they will be free ver y free spirits these philosophers of the certainly also they will not be merely free spirits but something more higher greater and fundamentally different which does not wish to be misunderstood and mistaken but while i say this i feel under obliga tion almost much to them to ourselves we free spirits who are their heralds and forerunners to sweep away from ourselves altogether stupid old prejudice and misunderstanding which like fog has too long made the conception of free spirit obscure in every country of europe and the same in america there is at present something which makes an abuse of this name very narrow prepossessed enchained class of spirits who desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts to mention that in respect to the new philosophers who are appearing they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors brieﬂy and regrettably they belong to the levellers these wrongly named free spirits and slaves of the democratic taste and its modern ideas all of them men without solitude without personal solitude blunt honest fellows to whom neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied only they are not free and are ludicrously superﬁcial especially in their innate partiality seeing the cause of almost all human misery and failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto notion which happily inverts the truth entirely what they would fain attain with all their strength is the universal happiness of the herd together with security safety comfort and alleviation of life every one their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrines are called equa lity of rights and sympathy with all

hitherto grown most vigorously believe that this has always taken place under the opposite conditions that this end the dangerousness of his situation had to be increased enormously his inventive

to betray in every respect wha t spirit can free itself from and where perhaps it will then be driven and to the import of the dangerous formula beyond good and evil with which we at least avoid

this virgin forest so he would like to have some hundreds of hunting assistants and ﬁne trained hounds that he could send into the history of the human soul to drive his game together in vain again and again he experiences profoundly and bitterly how difﬁcult it is to ﬁnd assistants and dogs all the things that directly excite his curiosity the evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous where courage sagacity and subtlety in every sense are required is that they are longer serviceable just when the big hunt and also the great danger commences is precisely then that they lose their keen eye and nose in order instance to divine and determine what sort of history the problem of knowledge and conscience has hitherto had in the souls of homine s religiosi person would perhaps himself have to possess profound bruised immense an experience the intellectual conscience of pascal and then he would still require that heaven of clear wicked spirituality which from above would be able to oversee arrange and effectively formulize this mass of dangerous and painful who could this service and who would have time to wait such servants evidently appear too rarely they are so

love of truth has its reward in heaven and already upon beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https faith such early christianity desired and not infrequently achieved in the midst of skeptical and southernly world which had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behind it and in it counting besides the education in tolerance which the imperium romanum faith is not that sincere austere by which perhaps luther or cromwell or some other northern barbarian of the spirit remained attach ed to his god and christianity it is much rather the faith of pascal which resembles in terrible manner continuous suicide of tough reason which is not to be slain at once and with single blow the christian faith from the beginning is sacriﬁce the sacriﬁce of all freedom all pride all of spirit it is at the same time subjection and there is cruelty and religious phoenicianism in this faith which is adapted to tender and very fastidious conscience it takes granted that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably painful that all the past and all the habits of such spirit resist the absurdissimum in the form of which faith comes to it modern men with their obtuseness regards all christian nomenclature have longer the sense the terrib ly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste by the paradox of the formula god on the cross hitherto there had never and nowhere been such boldness in inversion nor anything at once so dreadful questioning and questionable this formula it promised transvaluation of all ancient was the orient the profound orient it was the oriental slave who thus took revenge on rome and its noble toleration on the roman catholicism of and it was always not the faith but the freedom from the faith the and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith which made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt against them enlightenment causes revolt the slave desires the unconditioned he understands nothing but the tyrannous even in morals he loves he hates without nuance to the very depths to the point of pain to the point of many hidden sufferings make him revolt against the noble taste which seems to deny suffering the skepticism with regard to suffering fundamentally only an attitude of aristocratic morality was not the least of the causes also of the last great which began with the french revolution wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so far we ﬁnd it connected with three dangerous prescriptions to regim en solitude fasting and sexual abstine without its being possible to determine with certain ty which is cause and which is effect or if any relation at all of cause and effect exists there this latter doubt is justiﬁed by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among savage well among civilized peoples is the most sudden and excessive sensuality which then with equal suddenness transforms into penitential paroxysms renunciation and both symptoms perhaps explainable disguised epilepsy but nowhere is it more obligatory to put aside explanations around other type has there grown such mass of absurdity and superstition other type seems to have been more interesting to men and even to it is time to become just little indifferent here to learn caution or better still to look away to go et in the background of the most recent philosophy that of schopenhauer we ﬁnd almost the problem in itself this terrible note of interrogation of the religious crisis and awakening how is the negation of will possible how is the saint possible that seems to have been the very question with which schopenhauer made start and became philosopher and thus it was genuine schopenhauerian consequence that his most convinced adherent perhaps also his last far germany is concerned namely richard wagner should bring his own to an end just here and should ﬁnally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage kundry type vecu and it loved and lived at the very time that the in almost all european countries had an opportunity to study the type close at hand wherever the religious i call it the religious mood its latest epidemical outbreak and display the salvation army it be question however to what has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages and even to philosophers in the whole phenomenon of the saint it is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous ely the immediate succession of opposites of states of the soul regarded morally antithetical it was believed here to be that bad man was all at once turned into saint good man the hitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point is it not possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed itself under the dominion of morals because it believed in oppositions of moral values and saw read and interprete d these oppositions into the text and facts of the case what miracle only an error of interp retation lack of philology beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https it seems that the latin races are far more deeply attached to their catholicism than we northerners are to christianity generally and that consequently unbelief in catholic countries means something quite different from what it does among sort of revolt against the spirit of the race while with us it is rather return to the spirit or of the race we northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races even regards our talents have poor talents it one may make an exception in the case of the celts who have theretofore furnished also the best soil christian infection in the north the christian ideal blossomed forth in france much ever the pale sun of the north would allow it how strangely pious our taste are still these later french

astonishing in the religious life of the ancient greeks is the irrestrainable stream of gra titude which it pours is very superior kind of man who takes such an attitude towards nature and on when the populace got the upper hand in greece fear became rampant also in religion and christianity was preparing itself the passion god there are churlish and importunate kinds of it like that of whole of protestantism lacks the southern delica tezza there is an oriental exaltation of the mind in it like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave in the case of augustine instance who lacks in an offensive manner all nobility in bearing and desires there is feminine tenderness and sensuality in it which modestly and unconsciously longs unio mystica et physica in the case of madame guyon in many cases it appears curiously enough the disguise of girl or youth puberty here and there even the hysteria of an old maid also her last ambition the church has frequently canonized the woman in

said inquiringly there is perhaps reason it some very great danger about which the ascetic might wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors and visitors in word the mighty

in the jewish old testament the book of divine justice there are men things and sayings on such an immense scale that greek and indian literature has nothing to compare with it one stands with fear and reverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly and one has sad thoughts about old asia and its little peninsula europe which would like by all means to ﬁgure before asia the

cultured christianity need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those taste the old testament is touchstone with respect to great and small perhaps he will ﬁnd that the new testament the book of grace still appeals more to his heart there is much of the odour of the genuine tender stupid beadsman and petty soul in it to have bound up this new testament kind of rococo of taste in every respect along with the old testament into one book the bible the book in itself is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the spirit which literary europe has upon its conscience why atheism nowadays the father in god is thoroughly refuted equally so the judge the rewarder also his free will he does not even if he did he would not know how to help the worst is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly is he uncertain is what i have made out by questioning and listening at variety of conversations to be the cause of the decline of european theism it appears to that though the religious instinct is in vigorous growth rejects the theistic satisfaction with profound distrust what does all modern philosophy mainly since indeed more in deﬁance of him than on the basis of his attent at has been made on the part of all philosophers on the old conception of the soul under the guise of criticism of the subject and predicate is to say an attent at on the fundamental presupposition of christian doctrine modern philosophy epistemological skepticism is secretly or openly christian although keener ears be it said by means formerly in effect one believed in the soul one believ ed in grammar and the grammatical subject one said i is the condition think is the predicate and is think is an activity which one must suppose subject cause the attempt was then made with marvelous tenacity and subtlety to see if one could not get out of this net see if the opposite was not perhaps true think the condition and i the conditioned i therefore only synthesis which has been made by thinking itself kant really wished to prove that starting from the subject the subject could not be the object either the possibility of an apparent existence of the subject and therefore of the soul may not always have been strange to him thought which once had an immense power on earth the vedanta philosophy there is great ladder of religious cruelty with many rounds but three of these are the most important once on time men sacriﬁced human beings to their god and perhaps just those they loved the this category belong the ﬁrstling sacriﬁces of all primitive religions and also the sacriﬁce of the emperor tiberius in the on the island of capri that most terrible of all roman anachronisms then during the moral epoch of mankind they sacriﬁc ed to their god the strongest instincts they possessed their nature this festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and fanatics finally what still remained to be sacriﬁced was it not necessary in the end men to sacriﬁce everything comforting holy healing all hope all faith in hidden harmonies in future blessedness and justice was it not necessary to sacriﬁce god himself and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone stupidity gravity fate nothingness to sacriﬁce god paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved the rising generation we all know something thereof already whoever like myself prompted by some enigmatical desire has long endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it from the narrowness and stupidity in which it has ﬁnally presented itself to this century namely in the form of schopenhauer philosophy whoever with an asiatic and super eye has actually looked inside and into the most ing of all possible modes of good and evil and longer like buddha and schopenhauer under the dominion and delusion of morality whoever has done this has perhaps just thereby without really desiring it opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal the ideal of the most exuberant and vivacious man who has not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and is but wishes to have it again it was and is all eternity insatiably calling out capo not only to himself but to the whole piece and play and not only the play but actually to him who requires the makes it necessary because he always requires himself makes himself necessary and this would not vitiosus deus the distance and it were the space around man grows with the strength of his intellectual vision and insight his world becomes profounder new stars new enigmas and notions are ever coming into view perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercised its acuteness beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https has just been an occasion its exercise something of game something children and childish minds perhaps the most solemn conceptions that have caused the most ﬁghting and suffering the conceptions god and sin will one day seem to us of more importance than child plaything or child pain seems to an old man perhaps another plaything and another pain will then be necessary once more the old man childish enough an eternal child has it been observed to what extent outward idleness or is necessary to real religious life alike its favourite microscopic labour of and its soft placidity called prayer the state of perpetual readiness the coming of god i mean the idleness with good conscience the idleness of olden times and of blood to which the aristocratic sentiment that work is it vulgarizes body and not quite unfamiliar and that consequently the modern noisy conceited foolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares unbelief more than anything else among these instance who are at present living apart from religion in germany i ﬁnd of diversiﬁed species and origin but above all majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation has dissolved the religious instincts so that they longer know what purpose religions serve and only note their existence in the world with kind of dull astonishment they feel themselves already fully occupied these good people be it by their business or by their pleasures not to mention the fatherland and the newspapers and their family duties it seems that they have time whatever left religion and above all it is not obvious to them whether it is question of new busine ss or new pleasure it is impossible they say to thems elves that people should go to church merely to spoil their tempers they are by means enemies of religious customs should certain circumstances state affairs perhaps require their participation in such customs they what is required so many things are patient and unassuming seriousness and without much curiosity or discomfort live too much apart and outside to feel even the necessity or against in such matters among those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowad ays the majority of german protestants of the middle classes especially in the great laborious centres of trade and commerce also the majority of laborious scholars and the entire university personnel with the exception of the theologians whose existence and possibility there always gives psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve on the part of pious or merely people there is seldom any idea of how much one might say arbitrary will is now necessary german scholar to take the problem of religion seriously his whole profession and i have said his whole workmanlike laboriousness to which he is compelled by his modern conscience inclines him to lofty and almost charitable serenity regards religion with which is occasionally mingled slight disdain the uncleanliness of spirit which he takes granted wherever any one still professes to belong to the church it is only with the help of history not throu gh his own personal experience therefore that the scholar succeeds in bringing himself to respectful seriousness and to certain timid deference in presence of religions but even when his sentiments have reached the stage of gratitude towards them he has not personally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself church or piety perhaps even the contrary the practical indifference to religious matters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up usually sublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness which shuns contact with religious men and things and it may be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with age has its own divine type of naivete the discovery of which other ages may envy it and how much able childlike and boundlessly foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in his superiority in the good conscience of his tolerance in the unsuspecting simple certainty with which his instinct treats the religious man lower and less valuable type beyond before and above which he himself has the little arrogant dwarf and the sedulously alert drudge of ideas of modern ideas whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what wisdom there is in the fact that men are superﬁcial it is their prese rvative instinct which teaches them to be ﬂighty lightsome and false here and there one ﬁnds passionate and exaggerated adoration of pure forms in philosophers well in artists it is not to be doubted that whoever has need of the cult of the superﬁcial to that extent has at one time or another made an unlucky dive benea th it perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt children the born artists who ﬁnd the enjoyment of life only in trying to falsify its image if taking wearisome revenge on it one might guess to what degree life has disgusted them by the extent to which they wish to see its beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https attenuated ultriﬁed and deiﬁed might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists their highest rank it is the profound suspicious fear of an incurable pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into religious interpretation of existence the fear of the instinct which divines that truth might be attained too soon before man has become strong enough hard enough artist enough piety the life in god regarded in this light would appear the most elaborate and ultimate product of the fear of truth doration and intoxication in presence of the most logical of all falsiﬁcations the will to the inversion of truth to untruth at any price perhaps there has hitherto been more effective means of beautifying man than piety by means of it man can become so artful so superﬁcial so iridescent and so good that his appearance longer of fends to love mankind god has so far been the noblest and remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained that love to mankind without any redeeming intention in the background is only an additional folly and brutishness that the inclination to this love has ﬁrst to get its proportion its delicacy its gram of salt and sprinkling of amber gris from higher ﬁrst perceived and experienced this however his tongue may have stammered it attempted to express such delicate matter let him all time be holy and respected the man who has so far ﬂown highest and gone astray in the ﬁnest fashion the philosopher we free spirits understand the man of the greatest responsibility who has the conscience the general development of mankind use religion his disciplining and educating work just he will use the contemporary political and economic conditions the selecting and disciplining well creative and fashioning can be exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied according to the sort of people placed under its spell and protection those who are strong and independent destined and trained to command in whom the judgment and skill of ruling race is incorporated religion is an additional means overcoming resistance in the exercise of bond which binds rulers and subjects in common betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter their inmost heart which would fain escape obedience and in the case of the unique natures of noble origin if by virtue of superior spirituality they should incline to more retired and contemplative life reserving to themselves only the more reﬁned forms of government over chosen disciples or members of an order religion itself may be used means obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of managing grosser affairs and securing immunity from the una voidable ﬁlth of all political agitation the brahmins instance understood this fact with the help of religious organization they secured to themselves the power of nominating kings the people while their sentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside men with higher and super mission at the same time religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves future ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes in which through fortunate marriage customs volitional power and delight in are on the increase to them religion offers sufﬁcient incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality and to experience the sentiments of authoritative of silence and of solitude asceticism and puritanism are almost indispensable means of educat ing and ennobling race which seeks to rise above its hered itary baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy and ﬁnally to ordinary men to the majority of the people who exist service and general utility and are only so far entitled to exist religion gives invaluable contentednes s with their lot and condition peace of heart ennoblement of obedience additional social happiness and sympathy with something of transﬁguration and embellishment something of justiﬁcation of all the commonplaceness all the meanness all the poverty of their souls religion together with the religious signiﬁcance of life sheds sunshine over such perpetually harassed men and makes even their own aspect endurable to them it operates upon them the epicurean philosophy usually operates upon sufferers of higher order in refreshing and reﬁning manner almost turning suffering to account and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it there is perhaps nothing so admirable in christianity and buddhism their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by piety to seemingly higher order of things and thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they ﬁnd it difﬁcult enough to very difﬁculty being necessary to be make also the bad counter against such religions and to bring to light their secret cost is always excessive and terrible when religions not operate an educational and

is perhaps subtle belated diverse sensitive and reﬁned the science of morals belonging thereto is recent initial awkward and interesting contrast which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious in the very person of moralist indeed the expression science of morals is in respect to what is designated thereby far too presumptuous and counter to good taste is always foretas of more modest expressions one ought to avow with the utmost fairness wha t is still necessary here long time wha t is alone proper the present namely the collection of material the comprehensive survey and classiﬁcation of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth and distinctions of worth which live grow propagate and perhaps attempts to give clear idea of the recurring and more common forms of these living preparation theor y of types of morality to be sure people have not hitherto been so modest all the philosophers with pedantic and ridiculous seriousness demanded of themselves something very much higher more pretentious and ceremonious when they concerned themselves with morality science they wanted to give basic to mora every philosopher hitherto has believed that he has given it basis morality itself however has been regarded something given how far from their awkward pride was the seemingly insigniﬁcant in dust and description of forms of morality notwithstanding that the ﬁnest hands and senses could hardly be ﬁne enough it it was precisely owing to moral philosophers knowi ng the moral facts imperfectly in an arbitrary epitome or an accidental the morality of their environment their position their church their zeitgeist their climate and was precisely because they were badly instructed with regard to nations eras and past ages and were by means eager to know about these matters that they did not even come in sight of the real problems of which only disclose themselves by comparison of many kinds of morality in every science of morals hitherto strange it may sound the problem of morality itself has been omitted there has been suspicion that there was anything problematic there that which philosophers called giving basis to morality and endeavoured to realize has when seen in right light proved merely learned form of good faith in prevailing morality new means of its expression consequently just matter within the sphere of deﬁnite morality yea in its ultimate motive sort of denial that it is lawful this morality to be called in in any case the reverse of the testing analyzing doubting and vivisecting of this very faith hear instance with what

difﬁculty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be great is well known that schopenhaue r also was unsuccessful in his efforts and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and sentimental this proposition is in world whose essence is will to power may be reminded that schopenhauer although pessimist actuall the ﬂute daily after dinner one may read about the matter in his biography question by the beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https pessimist repudiator of god and of the world who makes hal t at assents to morality and plays the ﬂute to morals what is that pessimist apart from the value of such assertions there is categorical imperative in us one can always ask what does such an assertion indicate about him who makes it there are systems of morals which are meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people other systems of morals are meant to tranquilize him and make him with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself with others he wishes to take revenge with others to conceal himself with others to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction system of morals helps its author to forget that system makes him or something of him forgotten many moralist would like to exercise power and creative arbitrariness over mankind many another perhaps kant especially gives us to understand by his morals that what is estimable in is that i know how to with you it shall not be otherwise than with in short systems of mora ls are only language of the emotions in contrast to laisser every system of morals is sort of tyranny against nature and also against reason that is however objection unless one should again decree by some system of morals that all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful what is essential and invaluable in every system of morals is that it is long constraint in order to understand stoicism or port royal or puritanism one should remember the constraint under which every language has attained to strength and metrical constraint the tyranny of rhym and rhythm how much trouble have the poets and orators of every nation given themselves excepting some of the prose writers of today in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousness the sake of folly utilitarian bunglers say and thereby deem themselves from submission to arbitrary laws the anarchists say and thereby fancy themselves free even pirited the singular fact remains however that everything of the nature of freedom elegance boldness dance and masterly certainty which exists or has existed whether it be in thought itself or in administration or in speaking and persuading in art just in conduct has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary law and in all seriousness it is not at all improbable that precisel y this is nature and natural not laisser every artist knows how different from the state of letting himself go is his most natural condition the free arranging locating disposing and constructing in the moments of inspiration how strictly and delicately he then obeys thousand laws which by their very rigidness and precision defy all formulation by means of ideas even the most stable idea has in comparison therewith something ﬂoating manifold and ambiguous in it the essential thing in heaven and in earth is apparently to repeat it once more that there should be long obedience in the same direction there thereby results and has always resulted in the long run something which has made life worth living instance virtue art music dancing reason whatever that is transﬁguring reﬁned foolish or divine the long bondage of the spirit the distrustful constraint in the communicability of ideas the discipli ne which the thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance with the rules of church or court or conformable to aristotelian premises the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything that happened according to christian scheme and in every occurrence to rediscover and justify the christian god this violence arbitrariness severity dreadfulness and unreasonableness has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the european spirit has attained its strength its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be stiﬂed suffocated and spoilt in the process here everywhere nature shows herself she is in all her extravagant and indifferent magniﬁcence which is shocking but nevertheless noble that centuries european thinkers only thought in order to prove nowadays on the contrary we are suspicious of every thinker who wishes to prove something it was always settled beforehand what was to be the result of their strictest thinking it was perhaps in the asiatic astrology of former times or it is still at the present day in the innocent explanation of immediate personal events the glory of god or the good of the soul tyranny this arbitrariness this severe and magniﬁcent stupidity has educa ted the spirit slavery both in the coarser and the ﬁner sense is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual education and discipline one may look at every system of morals in this light it is nature therein which teaches to hate the laisser the too great freedom and implants the need limited horizons immediate teaches the narrowing of perspectives and

the ancient world although is appropriate in southern nations not precisely with respect to work many kinds of fasts are necessary and wherever powerful inﬂuences and habits prevail legislators have to see that intercalary days are appointed on which such impulses are fettered and learn to hunger anew viewed from higher standpoint whole generations and epochs when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting during which an impulse learns to humble and submit the same time also to purify and sharpen itself certain philosophical sects likewise admit of similar interpretation instance the stoa in the midst of hellenic culture with the atmosphere rank and overchar ged with aphrodisiacal odours also is hint the explanation of the paradox why it was precisely in the most christian period of european history and in general only under the pressure of christian sentiments that the sexual impulse sublimated into love amour there is something in the morality of plato which does not really belong to plato but which only appears in his philosophy one might say in spite of him namely socratism which he himself was too noble one desires to injure himself hence all evil is done unwittingly the evil man inﬂicts injury on himself he would not so however if he knew that evil is evil the evil man therefore is only evil through error if one free him from error one will necessarily make him mode of reasoning savours of the populace who perceive only the unpleasant consequences of and practically judge that it is stupid to wrong while they accept good identical with usefu l and pleasant without further though regards every system of utilitarianism one may at once assume that it has the same origin and follow the scent one will seldom did all he could to interpret something reﬁned and noble into the tenets of his teacher and above all to interpret himself into the most daring of all interpreters who lifted the entire socrates out of the street popular theme and song to exhibit him in endless and impossible in all his own disguises and multiplicities in jest and in homeric language well what is the platonic socrates if greek words inserted here the old theological problem of faith and knowledge or more plain ly of instinct and question whether in respect to the valuation of things instinct deserves more authority than rationality which wants to appreciate and act according to motives according to why that is to say in conformity to purpose and is always the old moral proble m that ﬁrst appeared in the person of socrates and had divided men minds long before christianity socrates himself following of course the taste of his of surpassing ﬁrst the side of reason and in fact what did he all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the noble athenians who were men of instinct like all noble men and could never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their action s in the end however though silently and secretly he laughed also at himself with his ﬁner conscience and introspection he found in himself the same difﬁculty and incapacity but why said to should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts one must set them right and the reason must follow the instincts but at the same time persuade the reason to support them with good arguments this was the real falseness of that great and mysterious ironist he brought his conscience up to the point that he was satisﬁed with kind of in fact he perceived the irrationality in the moral more innocent in such matters and without the craftiness of the plebeian wished to prove to himself at the expenditure of all his greatest strength philosopher had ever reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one goal to the good to god and since plato all theologians and philoso phers have followed the same hich means that in matters of morality instinct or christians call it faith or i call it the herd has hitherto triumphed unless one should make an exception in the case of descartes the father of rationalism and consequently the grandfather of the revolution who recognized only the authority of reason but reason is only tool and descartes was beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https whoever has followed the history of single science ﬁnds in its development clue to

proportion to the small number who view therefo re of the fact that obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto one may reasonably suppose that generally speaking the need thereof is now innate in every one kind of formal conscience which gives the command thou shalt unconditionally something unconditionally refrain from something in short thou shalt this need tries to satisfy itself and to ﬁll its form with content according to its strength impatience and eagernes s it at once seizes an omnivorous appetite with little selection and accepts whatever is shouted into its ear by all sorts of teachers laws class prejudices or public opinion the extraordinary limitation of human development the hesitation protractedness frequent retrogression and turning thereof is attributable to the fact that the of obedience is transmitted best and at the cost of the art of command if one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent commanders and independent individuals will ﬁnally be lacking altogether or they will suffer inwardly from bad conscience and will have to impose deception on themselves in the ﬁrst place in order to be able to command just if they also were only obeying this condition of things actually exists in europe at call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding class they know other way of protecting themselves from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and higher orders of predecessors of the constitution of justice of the law or of god himself or they even justify themselves by maxims from the current opinions of the herd ﬁrst servants of their people or instruments of the public weal on the other hand the gregarious european man nowadays assumes an air if he were the only kind of man

clever gregarious men all representative constitutions example are of this origin in spite of all what blessing what deliverance from weight becoming unendurable is the appearance of an absolute ruler

century has attained in its worthiest individuals and periods the man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with one another who has the inheritance of diversiﬁed descent in his is to say contrary and often not only contrary instincts and standards of value which struggle with one another and are seldom at man of late culture and broken lights will on an average be weak man his fundamental desire is that the war which is in him should come to an end happiness appears to him in the character of soothing medicine and mode of thought instance epicurean or christian it is above

contrariety and conﬂict in such natures operate an additional incentive and stimulus to if on the other hand in addition to their powerful and irreconcilable instincts they have also inherited and indoctrinated into them proper mastery and subtlety carrying on the conﬂict with themselves that is to say the faculty of and there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and inexplicable

to my taste the hohenstaufen frederick the second and among artists perhaps leonardo vinci they appear precisely in the same periods when that weaker type with its longing repose comes to the front the two types are complementary to each other and spring from the same causes long the utility which determines moral estimates is only gregarious utility long the preservation of the community is only kept in view and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the communi ty there can be morality of love to one neighbour granted even that there is already little constant exercise of consideration sympathy fairness gentleness and mutual assistance granted that even in this condition of society all those instinct s are already active which are latterly distinguished by honourable names virtues and eventually almost coincide with the conception morality in that period they not yet belong to the domain of moral are still beyond good

is compatible with this praise even at the best directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole to the res publica after all love to our neighbour is always secondary matter partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our fear of our neighbour after the fabric of society seems on the whole established and secured against external dangers it is this fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral valuation certain strong and dangerous instincts such the love of enter prise foolhardiness revengefulness astuteness rapacity and love of power which up till then had not only to be honoured from the point of view of general other names of course than those here had to be fostered and cultivated because they were perpetually required in the common danger against the common enemies are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly when the outlets them are are gradually branded immora l and given over to calumny the contrary instincts and inclinations now attain to moral honour the gregarious instinct gradually draws its conclusions how much or how little dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion condition an emotion disposition or an is now the moral perspective here again fear is the mother of morals it is by the loftiest and strongest instincts when they break out passionately and carry the individual far above and beyond the average and the low level of the gregarious conscience that the of the community is destroyed its belief in itself its backbone it were breaks consequently these very instincts will be most branded and defamed the lofty independent spirituality the will to stand alone and even the cogent reason are felt to be dangers everything that elevates the individual above the herd and is source of fear to the neighbour is henceforth called evil the tolerant unassuming adapting disposition the mediocrity of desires attains to moral distinction and honour finally under very peaceful circumstances there is always less opportunity and necessity training the feelings to severity and rigour and now every form of severity even in justice begins to disturb the conscience lofty and rigorous nobleness and almost offends and awakens distrust the lamb and still more the sheep wins respect there is point of diseased mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society at which society itself takes the part of him who injures it the part of the criminal and does so in fact seriously and honestly to punish appears to it to be somehow is certain that the idea of punishment and the obligation to punish are then painful and alarming to people is it not sufﬁcient if the criminal be rendered harmless why should we still punish punishment itself is terrible these questions gregarious morality the morality of fear draws its ultimate conclusio if one could at all away with danger the cause of fear one would have done away with this morality at the same time it would longer be necessary it would not consider itself any longer necessary examines the conscience of the european will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds and hidden recesses the imperative of the timidity of the herd we wish that some time or other there may be nothing more to fear some time or will and the way theret is nowadays called progress all over europe let us at once say again what we have already said hundred times people ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths we know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one plainly and without metaphor counts man among the animals but it will be accounted to us almost crime that it is precisely in respect to men of modern ideas that we have constantly applied the terms herd and such like expre ssions what avail is it we can not otherwise it is precisely here that our new insight is we have found that in all the principal moral judgments europe has become unanimous including likewise the countries where european inﬂuence prevails in europe people evidently know what socrates thought he did not know and what the famous serpent of old once promised to know today what is good and evil it must then sound hard and be distasteful to the ear when we always insist that that which here thinks it knows that which here gloriﬁes itself with praise and blame and calls itself good is the instinct of the herding human animal the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more to the front to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of which it is the symptom morality in europe at present is morality and therefore we understand the matter only one kind of human morality beside which before which and after which many other moralities and above all high er moralities are or should be possible against such possibility against such should be however this morality defends itself with all its strength beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https obstinately and inexorably i am morality itself and nothing else is morality indeed with the help of religion which has humoured and ﬂattered the sublimest desires of the things have reached such point that we always ﬁnd more visible expression of this morality even in political and social arrangements the democra tic movement is the inheritance of the christian movement that its tempo however is much too slow and sleepy the more impatient ones those who are sick and distrac ted by the is indicated by the increasingly furious howling and always less disguis ed of the anarchist dogs who are now roving through the highways of european culture apparently in opposition to the peacefully industrious democrats and and still more so to the awkward philosophasters and who call themselve s socialists and want free society those are really at one with them all in their thorough and instin ctive hostility to every form of society other than that of the aut onomous herd to the extent even of repudiating the notions master and servant dieu ni maitre says socialist formula at one in their tenacious opposition to every special claim every special right and privilege this means ultimately opposition to ever y right when all are equal one needs rights any longer at one in their distrust of punitive justice though it were violation of the weak unfair to the necessar y consequences of all former society but equally at one in their religion of sympathy in their compassion all that feels lives and suffers down to the very animals up even to god extravagance of sympathy god belongs to democratic age altogether at one in the cry and impatience of their sympathy in their deadly hatred of suffering generally in their almost feminine incapacity witnessing it or allowing it at one in their involuntary beglooming and under the spell of which europe seems to be threatened with new buddhism at one in their belief in the morality of mutual sympathy though it were morality in itself the climax the attained climax of mankind the sole hope of the future the consolation of the present the great dischar ge from all the obligations of the past altogether at one in their belief in the community the deliverer in the herd and therefore in themselves we who

of such an important question of rank so not to speak of colour like the blind or against science like women and artists ah this dreadful science sigh their instinct and their shame it always finds things out the declaration of independence of the scientiﬁc man his emancipation from philosophy is one of the subtler effects of democratic organization and disor ganization the and of the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom and in its best does not mean to imply that in this case smells sweet here also the instinct of the populace cries freedom from all masters and after science has with the happiest results resisted theology whose it had been too long it now proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws philosophy and in its turn to play the master am i saying to play the philosopher on its own account my memory of scientiﬁc man if you please teems with the naivetes of insolence which i have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young naturalists and old physicians not to mention the most cultured and most conceited of all learned men the philologists and schoolmasters who are both the one and the other by profession on one occasion it was the specialist and the jack horner who instinctively stood on the defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities at another time it was the industrious worker who had got scent of otium and reﬁned luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher and felt himself aggrieved and belittled thereby on another occasion it was the colour of the utilitarian who sees nothing in philoso phy but series of refuted systems and an extravagant expenditure which does nobody any good at another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of the of knowledg became conspicuous at another time the disregard of individual philosophers which had involuntarily extended to disregard of philosophy generally in ﬁne i found most frequently behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars the evil of some particular philosopher to whom on the whole obedience had been foresworn without however the spell of his scornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid the result being general to all philosophy such seems to instance the of schopenhauer on the most modern germany by his unintelligent rage against hegel he has succeeded in severing the whole of the last generation of germans from its conn ection with german culture which culture all things considered has been an elevation and divining reﬁnement of the hist orical sense but precisely at this point schopenhauer himself was poor irreceptive and to the extent of ingeniousne ss on the whole speaking generally it may just have been the humanness of the modern philosophers themselves in short their contemptibleness which has injured most radically the reverence philosophy and opened the doors to the instinct of the populace let it but be acknowledged to what an extent our modern world diver ges from the whole style of the world of heraclitus plato empedocles and whatever else all the royal and magniﬁcent anchorites of the spirit were called and with what justice an honest man of science may feel himself of better family and origin in view of such representatives of philosophy who owing to the fashion of the present day are just much aloft they are beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https germany instance the two lions of berlin the anarchist eugen duhring and the amalgamist eduard von hartmann it is especially the sight of those philosophers who call themselves realists or positivists which is calculated to implant dangerous distrust in the soul of young and ambitious scholar those philosophers at the best are themselves but scholars and specialists that is very evident all of them are persons who have been vanquished and brought back again under the dominion of science who at one time or another claimed more from themselves without having right to the more and its who now creditably rancorously and vindictively represent in word and deed disbelief in the master and supremacy of philosophy after all how could it be otherwise science ﬂourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible on its countenance while that to which the entire modern philosophy has gradually sunk the remnant of philosophy of the present day excites distrust and displeasure if not scorn and pity philosophy reduced to theory of knowledge more in fact than difﬁdent science of epochs and doctrine of forbearance philosophy that never even gets beyond the threshold and rigorously denies itself the right to is philosophy in its last throes an end an agony something that awakens pity how could such the dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are in fact so manifold nowadays that one might doubt whether this fruit could still come to maturity the extent and towering structure of the sciences have increased enormously and therewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow tired even learner or will attach himself somewhere and specialize so that he will longer attain to his elevation that is to say to his superspection his circumspection and his despection or he gets aloft too late when the best of his maturity and strength is past or when he is impaired coarsened and deteriorated so that his view his general estimate of things is longer of much importance it is perhaps just the reﬁnement of his intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the way he dreads the temptation to become dilettante millepede milleantenna he knows too well that discerner one who has lost his longer commands longer leads unless he should aspire to become great philosophical cagliostro and spiritual short misleader this is in the last instance question of taste if it has not really been question of conscience to double once more the philosopher difﬁculties there is also the fact that he demands from himself verdict yea or nay not concerning science but concerning life and the worth of learns unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain this verdict and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief only through the most extensive perhaps disturbing and destroying experiences often hesitating doubting and dumbfounde in fact the philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude either with the scientiﬁc man and ideal scholar or with the religiously elevated desensualized desecularized visionary and man and even yet when one hears anybody praised because he lives wisely or philosopher it hardly means anything more than prudently and apart wisdom that seems to the populace to be kind of ﬂight means and artiﬁce withdrawing successfully from bad game but the genuine it not seem so to us my friends unphilosophically and unwisely above all imprudentl y and feels the obligation and burden of hundred attempts and temptations of life risks himself constantly he plays this bad game in relation to the genius that is to say being who either engenders or both words understood in their fullest man of learning the scientiﬁ c average man has always something of the old maid about him like her he is not conv ersant with the two principal functions of man to both of course to the scholar and to the old maid one concedes respectability if by way of these cases one emphasizes the and yet in the compulsion of this concession one has the same admixture of vexation let us examine more closely what is the scientiﬁc man firstly commonplace type of man with commonplace virtues that is to say and type of man he possesses industry patient adaptableness to rank and ﬁle equability and moderation in capacity and requirement he has the instinct people like himself and that which they require instance the portion of independe nce and green meadow without which there is rest from labour the claim to honour and consideration which ﬁrst and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability the sunshine of good name the perpetual ratiﬁcation of his value and usefulness with which the inward distrust which lies at the bottom of the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals has again and again to be overcome the learned man is appropriate has also maladies and faults of an ignoble kind he is full of petty envy and has the beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https in those natures to whose elevations he can not attain he is conﬁding yet only one who lets himself go but does not flow and precisely before the man of the great current he stands all the colder and more eye is then like smooth and irresponsive lake which is longer moved by rapture or sympathy the worst and most dangerous thing of which scholar is capable results from the instinct of mediocrity of his type from the jesuitism of medio crity which labours instinctively the destruction of the exceptional man and endeavours to still better to bent bow to relax of course with consideration and naturally with an indulgent hand relax with conﬁding sympathy that is the real art of jesuitism which has always understood how to introduce itself the religion of sympathy however gratefully one may welcome the objective who has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded ipsisimosity the end however one must learn caution even with regard to one gratitude and put stop to the exaggeration with which the unselﬁng and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been celebrated if it were the goal in itself if it were salvation and is especially accustomed to happen in the pessimist school which has also in its turn good reasons paying the highest honours to disinterested knowledge the objectiv man who longer curses and scold s like the pessimist the ideal man of learning in whom the scientiﬁc instinct blossoms forth fully after thousand complete and partial failures is assuredly one of the most costly instruments that exist but his place is in the hand of one who is more powerful he is only an instrument we may say he is mirror is purpose in himself the objective man is in truth mirror accustomed to prostration before everything that wants to be known with such desires only knowing or reﬂecting implies waits until something comes and then expands himself sensitively so that even the light footsteps and of spiritual beings may not be lost on his surface and ﬁlm whatever personality he still possesses seems to him accidental arbitrary or still oftener disturbing so much has he come to regard himself the passage and reﬂection of outside forms and events he calls up the recollection of himself with an effort and not infrequently wrongly he readily confounds himself with other persons he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs and here only is he unreﬁned and negligent perhaps he is troubled about the health or the pettiness and conﬁned atmosphere of wife and frien d or the lack of companions and he sets himself to reﬂect on his suffering but in vain his thoughts already rove away to the more general case and tomorrow he knows little he knew yesterday how to help himself he does not now take himself seriously and devote time to himself he is serene not from lack of trouble but from lack of capacity grasping and dealing with his trouble the habitual complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences the radiant and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that comes his way his habit of inconsiderate of dangerous indifference to yea and nay alas there are enough of cases in which he has to atone these virtues of his man generally he becomes far too easily the caput mor tuum of such virtues should one wish love or hatred from mean love and hatred god woman and animal understand will what he can and furnish what he can but one must not be surprised if it should not be he should show himself just at this point to be false fragile questionable and deteriorated his love is constrained his hatred is artiﬁcial and rather un tour force slight ostentation and exaggeration he is only genuine so far he can be objective only in his serene totality is he still nature and natural his mirroring and eternally soul longer knows how to afﬁrm longer how to deny he does not command neither does he destroy je ne meprise presque rien says with leibniz let us not overlook nor undervalue the presque neither is he model man he does not go in advance of any one nor after either he places himself generall y too far off to have any reason espousing the cause of either good or evil if he has been so long confounded with the philosopher with the caesarian trainer and dictator of civilization he has had far too much honour and what is more essential in him has been is an instrument something of slave though certainly the sublimest sort of slave but nothing in rien the objective man is an instrument costly easily injured easily tarnished measuring instrument and mirroring apparatus which is to be taken care of and respected but he is goal not outgoing nor upgoing complementary man in whom the rest of existence justiﬁes itself still less commencement an engendering or primary cause nothing hardy powerful that wants to be master but rather only soft inﬂated delicate movable that must wait some kind of content and frame to shape itself the most part man without frame and content selﬂess man consequently also nothing women in p beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https when philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the objective spirit all hear it impatiently they regard him on that account with some apprehension they would like to ask so many many questions indeed among timid hearers of whom there are now so many he is henceforth said to be dangerous with his repudiation of skepticism it seems to them if they heard some threatening sound in the distance if new kind of explosive were being tried somewhere dynamite of the spirit perhaps newly discovered russian nihiline pessimism bonae volunt atis that not only denies means denial thought practises denial against this kind of will to the veritable actual negation of is is generally acknowledged nowadays better soporiﬁc and sedative than skepticism the mild pleasing lulling poppy of skepticism and hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day an antidote to the spirit and its under ground noises are not our ears already full of bad sounds say the skeptics lovers of repose and almost kind of safety police this subterranean nay is terrible be still ye pessimistic moles the skeptic in effect that delicate creature is far too easily frightened his conscience is schooled so to start at every nay and even at that sharp decided yea and feels something like bite thereby yea and nay seem to him opposed to morality he loves on the contrary to make festival to his virtue by noble aloofness while perhaps he says with montaigne what i know or with socrates i know that i know nothing or here i not trust mysel f door is open to or even if the door were open why should i enter immediately or what is the use of any hasty hypotheses it might quite well be in good taste to make hypotheses at all are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is crooked to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum is there not time enough that has not the time leisure oh ye demons can ye not at all wait the uncertain also has its charms the sphinx too is circe and circe too was philosopher does skeptic console himself and in truth he needs some consolation skepticism is the most spiritual expression of certain physiological temperament which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and sickliness it arises whenever races or classes which have been long separated decisively and suddenly blend with one another in the new generation which has inherited it were different standards and valuations in its blood everything is disquiet derangement doub t and tentativeness the best powers operate restrictively the very virtues prevent each other growing and becoming strong equilibrium ballast and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul that however which is most diseased and degenerat ed in such nondescripts is the will they are longer familiar with independence of decision or the courageous feeling of pleasure in are doubtful of the freedom of the will even in their dreams our europe the scene of senseless precipitate attempt at radical blending of classes and consequentl y of races is therefore skeptical in all its heights and depths sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch sometimes with gloomy aspect like cloud ged with interrogative often sick unto death of its will paralysis of will where we not ﬁnd this cripple sitting nowadays and yet how bedecked oftentimes how seductively ornamented there are the ﬁnest gala dresses and disguises this disease and that instance most of what places itself nowadays in the objective ness the scientiﬁc spirit t pour t and pure voluntary knowledge is only skepticism and paralysis of am ready to answer this diagnosis of the european disease of the will is diffused unequally over europe it is worst and most varied where civilization has longest prevailed it decreases according the barbarian his claims under the loose drapery of western culture it is therefore in the france of today can be readily disclosed and comprehended that the will is most inﬁrm and france which has always had masterly aptitude converting even the portentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over europe by being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism the power to will and to persist moreover in resolution is already somewhat stronger in germany and again in the north of germany it is stronger than in central germany it is considerably stronger in england spain and corsica associated with phlegm in the former and with hard skulls in the to mention italy which is too young yet to know what it wants and must ﬁrst show whether it can exercise will but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense middle empire where europe it were ﬂows back to in russia there the power to will has been long stored up and accumulated there the whether to be negative or threateningly to be dischar ged to borrow their pet phrase from our physicists perhaps not only indian wars beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https in asia would be necessary to free europe from its greatest danger but also internal subversion the shattering of the empire into small states and above all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility together with the obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast i not say this one who desires it in my heart i should rather prefer the mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of russia that europe would have to make up its mind to become equally to acquire one will by means of new caste to rule over the continent persistent dreadful will of its own that can set its aims thousands of years ahead so that the long comedy of its and its dynastic well its democratic might ﬁnally be brought to close the time petty politics is past the next century will bring the struggle the dominion of the pulsion to great politics to how far the new warlike age on which we europeans have evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger kind of skepticism i should like to express myself preliminarily merely by parable which the lovers of german history will already understand that unscrupulous enthusiast big handsome grenadiers who king of prussia brought into being military and skeptical therewith in reality the new and now triumphantly emer ged type of german the problematic crazy father of frederick the great had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius he knew what was then lacking in germany the want of which was hundred times more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social to the young frederick resulted from the anxiety of profound instinct men were lacking and he suspected to his bitterest regret that his own son was not man enough there however he deceived himself but who would not have deceived himself in his place he saw his son lapsed to atheism to the esprit to the pleasant frivolity of clever saw in the background the great bloodsucker the spider skepticism he suspected the incurable wretchedness of heart longer hard enough either evil or good and of broken will that longer commands is longer able to command meanwhile however there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous knows to wha t extent it was encouraged just by his father hatred and the icy melancholy of will condemned to solitude skepticism of daring manliness which is closely related to the genius war and conquest and made its ﬁrst entrance into germany in the person of the great frederick this skepticism despises and nevertheless grasps it undermines and takes possession it does not believe but it does not thereby lose itself it gives the spirit dangerous liberty but it keeps strict guard over the heart it is the german form of skepticism which continued fredericianism risen to the highest spirituality has kept europe considerable time under the dominion of the german spirit and its critical and historical distrust owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character of the great german philologists and historical critics who rightly estimated were also all of them artists of destruction and dissolution new conception of the german spirit gradually established spite of all romanticism in music and which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was decidedly prominent whether instance fearlessness of gaze courage and sternness of the dissecting hand or resolute will to dangerous voyages of discovery to spiritualized north pole expeditions under barren and dangerous skies there may be good grounds it when and superﬁcial humanitarians cross themselv es before this spirit cet esprit fataliste ironique mephist ophelique michelet calls it not without shudder but if one would realize how characteristic is this fear of the man in the german spirit which awakened europe out of its dogmatic slumber let us call to mind the former conception which had to be overcome by this new that it is not so very long ago that masculinized woman could dare with unbridled presumption to recommend the germans to the interest of europe gentle and poetical fools finally let us only understand profoundly enough napoleon astonishm ent when he saw goethe it reveals what had been regarded centuries the german spirit voila un homme was much to say but this is man and i only expected to see german supposing then that in the picture of the philosophers of the future some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps be skeptics in the sense something in them would only be designated not they themselves with equal right they might call themselves critics and assuredly they will be men of experiments by the name with which i ventured to baptize them i have already expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is this because critics in body and soul they will love to make use of experiments in beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense in their passion knowledge will they have to go further in daring and painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of democratic century can approve of is doubt these coming ones will be least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities which distinguish the critic from the skeptic i mean the certainty to standards of worth the conscious employment of unity of method the wary courage the and the capacity indeed they will avow among themselves delight in denial and dissection and certain considerate cruelty which knows how to handle the knife surely and deftly even when the heart bleeds they will be sterner and perhaps not always towards themselves only than humane people may desire they will not deal with the truth in order that it may please them or elevate and inspire will rather have little faith in truth bringing with it such revels the feelings they will smile those rigorous spirits when any one says in their presence that thought elevates why should it not be true or that work enchants why should it not be beautiful or that artist enlar ges why should he not be great perhaps they will not only have smile but genuine disgust all that is thus rapturous idealistic feminine and hermaphroditic and if any one could look into their inmost hearts he would not easily ﬁnd therein the intention to reconcile christian sentiments with antique taste or even with modern parliamentarism the kind of reconciliati on necessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory century critical discipline and every habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of the future they may even make display thereof their special they will not want to be called critics on that account it will seem to them small indignity to philosophy to have it decreed is so welcome nowadays that philosophy itself is criticism and critical nothing else whatever though this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the positivists of france and germany and possibly it even ﬂattered the heart and taste of kant let us call to mind the titles of his principal works our new philosoph ers will say notwithstanding that critic s are instruments of the philosopher and just on that account instruments they are far from being philosophers themselves even the great chinaman of konigsber g was only great critic i insist upon it that people ﬁnally cease confounding philosophical workers and in general scientiﬁc men with precisely here one should strictly give each his own and not give those far too much these far too little it may be necessary the education of the real philosopher that he himself should have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants the scientiﬁc workers of philosophy remain standing and must remain standi ng he himself must perhaps have been critic and dogmatist and historian and besides poet and collector and traveler and and moralist and seer and free spirit and almost everything in order to traverse the whole range of human values and estimations and that he may be able with variety of eyes and consciences to look from height to any distance from depth up to any height from nook into any expanse but all these are only preliminary conditions his task this task itself demands something requires him to crea values the philosophical workers after the excellent pattern of kant and hegel have to ﬁx and formalize some great existing body of is to say former determina tions of value creations of value which have become prevalent and are time called truths in the domain of the logical the political moral or the artistic it is these investigators to make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto conspicuous conceivable intelligible and manageable to shorten everything long even time itself and to subjuga the entire past an immense and wonderful task in the carrying out of which all reﬁned pride all tenacious will can surely ﬁnd satisfaction the real philosophers however are commanders and they say thus shall it be they determine ﬁrst the whither and the why of mankind and thereby set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers and all subjugators of the grasp at the future with creative hand and whatever is and was becomes them thereby means an instrument and hammer their knowing is crea ting their creating is their will to truth to there at present such philosophers have there ever been such philosophers must there not be such philosophers some day it is always more obvious to that the philosopher man indispensable the morrow and the day after the morrow has ever found himself and has been obliged to ﬁnd himself in contradiction to the day in which he lives his enemy has always been the ideal of his day hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one calls beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https regarded themselves lovers of wisdom but rather disagreeable fools and dangerous found their missio n their hard involuntary imperative mission in the end however the greatness of their mission in being the bad conscience of their age in putting the vivisector knife to the breast of the very virtues of their age they have betrayed their own secret it has been the sake of new greatness of man new untrodden path to his aggrandizement they have always disclosed how much hypocrisy indolence and how much falsehood was concealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality how much virtue was outlived they have always said we must remove hence to where you are least at home in the face of world of modern ideas which would like to conﬁne every one in corner in specialty philosopher if there could be philosophers nowadays would be compelled to place the greatness of man the conception of greatness precisely in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness in his he would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety of that which man could bear and take upon himself according to the extent to which man could stretch his responsibility nowadays the taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will nothing is so adapted to the spirit of the age weakness of will consequently in the ideal of the philosopher strength of will sternness and capacity prolonged resolution must specially be included in the conception of greatness with good right the opposite doctrine with its ideal of silly renouncing humble selﬂess humanity was suited to an opposite the sixteenth century which suffered from its accumulated energy of will and from the wildest torrents and ﬂoods of selﬁshness in the time of socrates among men only of instincts old conservative athenians who let themselves go the sake of happiness they said the sake of pleasure their conduct who had continually on their lips the old pompous words to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led irony was perhaps necessary greatness of soul the wicked socratic assurance of the old physician and plebeian who cut ruthlessly into his own ﬂesh into the ﬂesh and heart of the noble with look that said plainly enough not dissemble before we are equal at present on the contrar y when throughout europe the alone attains to honours and dispenses honours when equality of right can too readily be transformed into equality in mean to say into general war against everything rare strange and privileged against the higher man the higher soul the higher duty the higher responsibility the creative plenipotence and present it belongs to the conception of greatn ess to be noble to wish to be apart to be capable of being different to stand alone to have to live by personal initiative and the philosopher will betray something of his own ideal when he asserts he shall be the greatest who can be the most solitary the most concealed the most diver gent the man beyond good and evil the master of his virtues and of super of will precisely this shall be called grea tness diversiﬁed can be entire ample can be full and to ask once more the question is greatness it is difﬁcult to learn what philosopher is because it can not be taught one must know it by one should have the pride not to know it the fact that at present people all talk of things of which they can not have any experience is true more especially and unfortunately concerns the philosopher and philosophical matters very few know them are permitted to know them and all popular ideas about them are false thus instance the truly philosophical combination of bold exuberant spirituality which runs at presto pace and dialectic rigour and necessity which makes false step is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own experience and therefore should any one speak of it in their presence it is incredible to them they conceive of every necessity troubl esome painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint thinking itself is regarded by them something slow and hesitating almost trouble and often enough worthy of the swea t of the noble not at all something easy and divine closely related to dancing and exuberance to think and to take matter seriously arduously is one and the same thing to them such only has been their experience have here perhaps ﬁner intuition they who know only too well that precisely when they longer anything arbitrarily and everything of necessity their feeling of freedom of subtlety of power of creatively ﬁxing disposing and shaping reaches its short that necessity and freedom of will are then the same thing with them there is in ﬁne gradation of rank in psychical states to which the gradatio n of rank in the problems corresponds and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them without being predestined their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality of what use is it nimble everyday intellects or clumsy honest mechanics and empiricists to press in their plebeian ambition close beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https problems and it were into this holy of holies so often happens nowadays but coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets this is provided in the primary law of things the doors remain closed to those intruders though they may dash and break their heads thereon people have always to be born to high station or more deﬁnitely they have to be bred it person has only right to the word in its higher virtue of his descent the ancestors the blood decide here also many generations must have prepared the way the coming of the philosopher each of his virtues must have been separately acquired nurtured transmitted and embodied not only the bold easy delicate course and current of his thoughts but above all the readiness great responsibilities the majesty of ruling glance and contemning look the feeling of separation from the multitude with their duties and virtues the kindly patronage and defense of whatever is misunderstood and calumniated be it god or devil the delight and practice of supreme justice the art of commandin g the amplitude of will the lingering eye which rarely admires rarely looks up rarely loves chapter vii our virtues our virtues is probable that we too have still our virtues although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at little distance from us we europeans of the day after tomorrow we ﬁrstlings of the twentieth all our dangerous curiosity our multifariousness and art of disguising our mellow and seemingly sweetened cruelty in sense and shall presumably if we must have virtues have those only which have come to agreement with our most secret and heartfelt inclinations with our most ardent requirements well then let us look them in our labyrinths where we know so many things lose themselves so many things get quite lost and is there anything ﬁner than to search one own virtues is it not almost to believe in one own virtues but this believing in one own virtues it not practically the same what was formerly called one good conscience that long respectable pigtail of an idea which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads and often enough also behind their understandings it seems therefore that however little we may imagine ourselves to be and grandfatherly respectable in other respects in one thing we are nevertheless the worthy grandchildren of our grandfathers we last europeans with good consciences we also still wear their if you only knew how soon so very will be dif ferent in the stellar ﬁrmament there are sometimes two suns which determine the path of one planet and in certain cases suns of different colours shine around single planet now with red light now with green and then simultaneous ly illumine and ﬂood it with motley colours so we modern men owing to the complicated mechanism of our ﬁrmament are determined by different moralities our actions shine alternately in different colours and are seldom there are often cases also in which our actions are motley to love one enemies i think that has been well learnt it takes place thousands of times at present on large and small scale indeed at times the higher and sublimer thing takes place learn to despise when we love and precisely when we love best all of it however unconsciously without noise without ostentation with the shame and secrecy of goodness which forbids the utterance of the pompous word and the formula of virtue morality opposed to our taste nowadays this is also an advance it was an advance in our father s that religion an attitude ﬁnally became opposed to their taste including the enmity and voltairean bitterness against religion and all that formerly belonged to freethinker it is the music in our conscience the dance in our spirit to which puritan litanies moral sermons and wo chime let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment they never forgive us if they have once made mistake before us or even with regard to us inevitably become our instinctive calumniators and detractors even when they still remain our friends ed are the forgetful they get the better even of their beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https the psychologists of where else are there still psychologists nowadays never yet exhausted their bitter and manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise just though in short they betray something thereby flaubert instance the honest citizen of rouen neither saw heard nor tasted anything else in the end it was his mode of and reﬁned cruelty this is growing wearisome i would now recommend change something else namely the unconscious astuteness with which good fat honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks they have to perform the subtle barbed jesuitical astuteness which is thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the in its best subtler even than the understanding of its victims repeated proof that instinct is the most intelligent of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered in short you psychologists study the philosophy of the rule in its struggle with the exception there you have spectacle ﬁt gods and godlike malignity or in plainer words practise vivisection on good people on the homo bonae voluntatis on yoursel ves the practice of judging and condemning morally is the favourite revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so it is also kind of indemnity their being badly endowed by nature and ﬁnally it is an opportunity acquiring spirit and becoming malice spiritualises they are glad in their inmost heart that there is standard according to which those who are with intell ectual goods and privileges are equal to them they contend the equality of all before god and almost need the belief in god this purpose it is among them that the most powerful antagonists of atheism are found if any one were to say to them lofty spirituality is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of merely moral man would make them furious i shall take care not to say so i would rather ﬂatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only the ultimate product of moral qualities that it is synthesis of all qualities attributed to the merely moral man after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice perhaps during whole series of generations that lofty spirituality is precisely the spiritualising of justice and the beneﬁcent severity which knows that it is authorized to maintain grada tions of rank in the world even among not only among men now that the praise of the disin terested person is so popular one not without some an idea of wha t people actually take an interest in and what are the things generally which fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary the cultured even the learned and perhaps philosophers also if appearances not deceive the fact thereby becomes obvious that the greater part of what interests and charms higher natures and more reﬁned and fastidious tastes seems absolutely uninteresting to the average notwithstanding he perceive devotion to these interests he calls it desinteresse and wonders how it is possible to act disinterestedly there have been philosophers who could give this popular astonishment seductive and mystical other expression perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience inste ad of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that disinterested action is very interesting and interested action provided that and love what even an action love sake shall be unegoistic but you and the praise of the whoever has really offered sacriﬁce knows that he wanted and obtained something something from himself something from himself that he relinquished here in order to have more there perhaps in general to be more or even feel himself more but this is realm of questions and answers in which more fastidious spirit does not like to stay here truth has to stiﬂe her yawns so much when she is obliged to answer and after all truth is woman one must not use force with her 221 it sometimes happens said moralistic pedant and that i honour and respect an unselﬁsh man not however because he is unselﬁsh but because i think he has right to be useful to another man at his own expens in short the question is always who he is and who the other is instance in person created and destined command and modest retirement instead of being virtues would be the waste of virtues so it seems to every system of unegoistic morality which takes itself unconditionally and appeals to every one not only sins against good taste but is also an incent ive to sins of omission an additional seduction under the mask of precisely seduction and injury to the higher rarer and more privileged types of men moral systems must be compelled ﬁrst of all to bow before the grada tions of rank their presumption must be driven home to their they thoroughly understand at last that it is immoral to say that is right one is proper beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus exhorted systems of morals to practise morality but one should not be too much in the right if one wishes to have the laughers on one own side grain of wrong pertains even to good taste wherever sympathy fering is preached if i gather rightly other religion is any longer the psychologist have his ears open through all the vanity through all the noise which is natural to these preachers to all preachers he will hear hoarse groaning genuine note of it belongs to the overshadowing and uglifying of europe which has been on the increase century the ﬁrst symptoms of which are already speciﬁed documentarily in thoughtful letter of galiani to madame it is not reall y the cause thereof the man of modern ideas the conceited ape is excessively dissatisﬁed with is perfectly certain he suffers and his vanity wants him only to suffer with his fellows the hybrid tolerably ugly plebeian taken all in olutely requires costume he needs history storeroom of costumes to be sure he notices that none of the costumes ﬁt him changes and changes let us look at the nineteenth century with respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades of style and also with respect to its moments of desperation on account of nothing suiting us it is in vain to get ourselves up romantic or classical or christian or florentine or barocco or national in moribus et artibus it does not clothe us but the spirit especially the historical spirit proﬁts even by this desperation once and again new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested put on taken off packed up and above all are the ﬁrst studious age in puncto of costumes i mean concerns morals articles of belief artistic tastes and religions we are prepared other age has ever been carnival in the grand style the most spiritual and arrogance the transcendental height of supreme folly and aristophanic ridicule of the world perhaps we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here the domain where even we can still be original probably parodists of the world history and god though nothing else of the present have future our laughter itself may have future the historical sense or the capacity divining quickly the order of rank of the valuations according to which people community or an individual has lived the divining instinct the relationships of these valuations the relation of the authority of the valuations to the authority of the operating forces historical sense which we europeans claim our specialty has come to us in the train of the enchanting and mad into which europe has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes and is only the nineteenth century that has recognized this faculty its sixth sense owing to this mingling the past of every form and mode of life and of cultures which were formerly closely contiguous and superimposed on one another ﬂows forth into us modern souls our instincts now run back in all directions we ourselves are kind of chaos in the end we have said the spirit perceives its advantage therein by means of our in body and in desire we have secret access everywhere such noble age never had we have access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations and to every form of that has at any time existed on earth and in so far the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto has just been the historical sense implies almost the sense and instinct everything the taste and tongue everything whereby it immediately proves itself to be an ignoble sense instance we enjoy homer once more it is perhaps our happiest acquisition that we know how to appreciate homer whom men of distinguished culture the french of the seventeenth century like who reproached him his espri t vaste and even voltaire the last echo of the century can not and could not so easily appro they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy the very decided yea and nay of their palate their promptly ready disgust their hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange their horror of the bad taste even of lively curiosity and in general the averseness of every distinguished and culture to avow new desire dissatisfaction with its own condition or an admiration of what is strange all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards the best things of the world which are not their property or could not become their faculty is more unintelligible to such men than just this historical sense with its truckling plebeian curiosity the case is not different with shakespeare that marvelous synthesis of taste over whom an ancient athenian of the circle of aeschylus would have himself with laughter or irritation but precisely this wild motleyness this medley of the beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https the most coarse and the most artiﬁcial with secret conﬁdence and cordiality we enjoy it reﬁnement of art reserved expressly us and allow ourselves to be little disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the english populace in which shakespeare art and taste lives perhaps on the chiaja of naples where with all our senses awake we go our way enchanted and voluntarily in spite of the of the lower quarters of the town that men of the historical sense we have our virtues is not to be disputed are unpretentious unselﬁsh modest brave habituated to and very grateful very patient very with all this we are perhaps not very tasteful let us ﬁnally confess it that what is most difﬁcult us men of the historical sense to grasp feel taste and love what ﬁnds us fundamentally prejudiced and almost hostile is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every culture and art the essentially noble in works and men their moment of smooth sea and halcyon the goldenness and coldness which all things show that have perfected themselves perhaps our great virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to good taste at least to the very bad taste and we can only evoke in ourselves imperfectly hesitatingly and with compulsion the small short and happy godsends and gloriﬁcations of human life they shine here and there those moments and marvelous experiences when great power has voluntarily come to halt before the boundless and inﬁnite super of reﬁned delight has been enjoyed by sudden checking and petrifying by standing ﬁrmly and planting oneself ﬁxedly on still trembling ground propor tiona teness is strange to us let us confess it to ourselves our itching is really the itching the inﬁnite the immeasurable like the rider on his forward panting horse we let the reins fall before the inﬁnite we modern men we are only in our highest bliss when in most danger whether it be hedonism pessimi sm utilitarianism or eudaemonism all those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according to pleasure and pain that is according to accompanying circumstances and secondary considerations are plausible modes of thought and naivetes which every one conscious of crea powers and an artist conscience will look down upon with scorn though not without sympathy sympathy you be sure that is not sympathy you understand it it is not sympathy social distress society with its sick and misfortuned the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie on the ground around us still less is it sympathy the grumbling vexed revolutionary who strive after call it freedom our sympathy is loftier and further sympathy see how man dwarfs himself how you dwarf him and there are moments when we view your sympathy with an indescribable anguish when we resist it we regard your seriousness more dangerous than any kind of levity you want if there is not more foolish if possible away with suffering and we really seems that we would rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been you understand certainly not goal it seems to us an end condition which at once renders man ludicrous and makes his destruction desirable the disciplin of suffering of grea t ye not that it is only this discipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto the tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it its energy its shuddering in view of rack and ruin its inventiveness and bravery in under going enduring interpreting and exploiting misfortune and whatever depth mystery disguise spirit artiﬁce or greatness has been bestowed upon the it not been bestowed through suffering through the discipline of great suffering in man crea ture and crea tor are united in man there is not only matter shred excess clay mire folly chaos but there is also the creator the sculptor the hardness of the hammer the divinity of the spectator and the seventh ye understand this contrast and that you r sympathy the creature in man applies to that which has to be fashioned bruised forged stretched roasted annealed that which must necessarily suffer and is meant to suffer and our ye not understand what our reverse sympathy applies to when it resists your sympathy the worst of all pampering and enervation it is sympathy against sympathy but to repeat it once more there are higher problems than the problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy and all systems of philosophy which deal only with these are naivetes we world with which we are concerned in whic h we have to fear and love this almost invisible inaudible world of delicate command and delicate obedience world of almost in every respect captious insidious sharp and it is well protected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity we are woven into strong net and garment of duties and can not disengage here we are men of duty even we occasionally it beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https we dance in our chains and betw ixt our swords it is none the less true that more often we gnash our teeth under the circumstances and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot but what we will fools and appearances say of us these are men without duty have always fools and appearances against us honesty granting that it is the virtue of which we can not rid ourselves we free we will labour at it with all our perversity and love and not tire of perfecting ourselves in our virtue which alone remains may its glance some day overspread like gilded blue mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dull gloomy seriousness and if nevertheless our honesty should one day grow weary and sigh and stretch its limbs and ﬁnd us too hard and would fain have it pleasanter easier and gentler like an agreeable vice let us remain hard we latest stoics and let us send to its help whatever devilry we have in us disgust at the clumsy and undeﬁned our nitimur in vetitum our love of adventure our sharpened and fastidious curiosity our most subtle disguised intellectual will to power and universal conquest which rambles and roves avidiously around all the realms of the us go with all our devils to the help of our god it is probable that people will misunderstand and mistake us on that account what does it matter they will say their is their devilry and nothing else what does it matter and even if they were not all gods hitherto been such sanctiﬁed devils and after all what we know of ourselves and what the spirit that leads us wants to be called it is question of names and how many spirits we harbour our honesty we free us be careful lest it become our vanity our ornament and ostentation our limitation our stupidity every virtue inclines to stupid ity every stupidity to virtue stupid to the point of sanctity they say in russia us be careful lest out of pure honesty we eventually become saints and bores is not life hundred times too short bore ourselves one would have to believe in eternal life in order to i hope to be forgiven discovering that all moral philosophy hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporiﬁc that virtue in my opinion has been more injured by the tediousness of its advocates than by anything else at the same time however i would not wish to overlook their general usefulness it is desirable that few people possible should reﬂect upon morals and consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day become interesting but let us not be afraid thin gs still remain today they have alwa ys been i see one in europe who has or discloses an idea of the fact that philosophizing conc erning morals might be conducted in dangerous captious and ensnaring calamity might be involved therein observe example the indefatigable inevitable english utilitarians how ponderously and respectably they stalk on stalk along homeric metaphor expresses it better in the footsteps of bentham just he had already stalked in the footsteps of the respectable helvetius he was not dangerous man helvetius ce sena teur pococurante to use an expression of galiani new thought nothing of the nature of ﬁner turning or better expression of an old thought not even proper history of what has been previously thought on the subject an impossible literature taking it all in all unless one knows how to leaven it with some mischief in effect the old english vice called cant which is moral tartuffism has insinuated itself also into these moralists whom one must certainly read with an eye to their motives if one must read them concealed this time under the new form of the scientiﬁc spirit moreover there is not absent from them secret struggle with the pangs of conscience from which race of former puritans must naturally suffer in all their scientiﬁc tinkering with morals is not moralist the opposite of puritan that is to say thinker who regards morality questionable worthy of interrogation in short problem is moralizing in the end they all want english morality to be recognized authoritat ive inasmuch mankind or the general utility or the happiness of the greatest number the happiness of england will be best served thereby they would like by all means to conv ince themselves that the striving after english happiness i mean after comfor t and fashion and in the highest instance seat in parliament is at the same time the true path of virtue in fact that in so far there has been virtue in the world hitherto it has just consisted in such striving not one of those ponderous animals who undertake to advocate the cause of egoism conducive to the general welfare wants to have any knowledge or inkling of the facts that the general welfare is ideal goal notion that can be at all grasped but is only nostrum what is fair to one may not at all be fair to another that the requirement of one morality all is really detrime nt to higher men in short that there is distinction of rank between man and man and consequently beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https and morality they are an unassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men these utilitarian englishmen and already remarked in so far they are tedious one can not think highly enough of their utility one ought even to encourage them has been partially attempted in the following rhymes hail ye worthies aye revealing stiffer aye in head and knee unenraptured never jesting mediocre everlasting sans genie et sans esprit in these later ages which may be proud of their humanity there still remains so much fear so much superstition of the fear of the cruel wild beast the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of these humaner even obvious truths if by the agreement of centuries have long remained unuttered because they have the appearance of helping the ﬁnally slain wild beast back to life again i perhaps risk something when i allow such truth to escape let others capture it again and give it so much milk of pious sentiment footnote an expression from schiller william tell act iv scene 3 to drink that it will lie down quiet and forgotten in its old corner ought to learn anew about cruelty and open one eyes one ought at last to learn impatience in order that such immodest gross instance have been fostered by ancient and modern philosophers with regard to longer wander about virtuously and boldly almost everything that we call higher culture is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of cruel is my thesis the wild beast has not been slain at all it lives it ﬂourishes it has only that which constitutes the painful delight of tragedy is cruelty that which operates agreeably in tragic sympathy and at the basis even of everything sublime up to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics obtains its sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty what the roman enjoys in the arena the christian in the ecstasies of the cross the spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake or of the the japanese who presses his way to the tragedy the workman of the parisian suburbs who has homesickness bloody revolutions the wagnerienne who with unhinged will under goes the performance of tristan and isolde all these enjoy and strive with mysterious ardour to drink in is the philtre of the great circe cruelty here to be sure we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of former times which could only teach with regard to cruelty that it originated at the sight of the suffering of others there is an abundant super enjoyment even in one own suffering in causing one own wherever man has allowed himself to be persuaded to in the religious sense or to among the phoenicians and ascetics or in general to desensualisation decarnalisation and contrition to puritanical to vivisection of conscience and to sacrifizia dell intellet he is secretly allured and impelled forwards by his cruelty by the dangerous thrill of cruelty towards himself let us consider that even the seeker of knowledge operates an artist and gloriﬁer of cruelty in that he compels his spirit to perceive against its own inclination and often enough against the wishes of his heart forces it to say nay where he would like to afﬁrm love and adore indeed every instance of taking thing profoundly and fundamentally is violation an intentional injuring of the fundamental will of the spirit which instinctively aims at appearance and superﬁciality in every desire knowledge there is drop of cruelty perhaps what i have said here about fundamental will of the spirit may not be understood without further details i may be allowed word of imperious something which is popularly called the spirit wishes to be master internally and externally and to feel itself master it has the will of multiplicity simplicity binding taming imperious and essentially ruling will its requirements and capacities here are the same those assigned by physiologists to everything that lives grows and multip lies the power of the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in strong tendency to assimilate the new to the old to simpl ify the manifold to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory just it arbitrarily makes prominent and falsiﬁes itself certain traits and lines in the foreign elements in every portion of the outside world its object thereby is the incorporation of new experiences the assortment of new things in the old short growth or more properly the feeling of beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https feeling of increased its object this same will has at its service an apparently opposed impulse of the spirit suddenly adopted preference of ignorance of arbitrary shutting out closing of windows an inner denial of this or that prohibition to approach sort of defensive attitude against much that is knowable contentment with obscurity with the horizon an acceptance and approval of ignorance that which is all necessary according to the degree of its appropriating power its digestive power to speak ﬁguratively and in fact the spirit resembles stomach more than anything else here also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be deceived perhaps with waggish suspicion that it is not so and so but is only allowed to pass such delight in uncertainty and ambiguity an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary narrowness and mystery of the of the foreground of the magniﬁed the diminished the misshapen the enjoyment of the arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power finally in this connection there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to deceive other spirits and dissemble before constant pressing and straining of creating shaping changeable power the spirit enjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises it enjoys also its feeling of security is precisely by its protean arts that it is best protected and concealed to this propensity appearance simpliﬁcation disguise cloak in short an every outside is operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge which takes and insist s on taking things profoundly variously and thoroughly kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste which every courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself provided it ought to be that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufﬁciently long introspection and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe words he will say there is something cruel in the tendency of my spirit let the virtuou s and amiable try to convince him that it is not so in fact it would sound nicer if instead of our cruelty perhaps our extravagant honesty were talked about whispered about and free ver y free spirits some day perhaps such will actually be glory there is plenty of time until should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in such ﬂorid and fringed moral verbiage our whole former work has just made us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance they are beautiful glistening jingling festive words honesty love of truth love of wisdom sacriﬁce knowledge heroism of the is something in them that makes one heart swell with pride but we anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the secrecy of an anchorite conscience that this worthy parade of verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment frippery and dust of unconscious human vanity and that even under such ﬂattering colour and repainting the terrible original text homo natura must again be recognized in effect to translate man back again into nature to master the many vain and visionary interpretations and subordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over the eternal original text homo natura to bring it about that man shall henceforth stand before man he now hardened by the discipline of science stands before the other forms of nature with fearless and stopped deaf to the enticements of old metaphysical catchers who have piped to him far too long thou art more thou art higher thou hast different origin may be strange and foolish task but that it is task who can deny why did we choose it this foolish task or to put the question differently why knowledge at all every one will ask us about this and thus pressed we who have asked ourselves the quest ion hundred times have not found and can not ﬁnd any better answer learning alters us it does what all nourishment does that does not merely conserve the physiologist knows but at the bottom of our souls quite down below there is certainly something unteachable granite of spiritual fate of predetermined decision and answer to predetermined chosen questions in each cardinal problem there speaks an unchangeable i am this thinker can not learn anew about man and woman instance but can only learn can only follow to the end what is ﬁxed about them in himself occasionally we ﬁnd certain solutions of problems which make strong beliefs us perhaps they are henceforth called convictions later sees in them only footsteps to to the problem which we ourselves are more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody our spiritual fate the unteachable in us quite down below view of this liberal compliment which i have just paid myself permission will perhaps be more readily allowed to utter some truths about woman she is provided that it is known at the outset how literally they are truths woman wishes to be independent and therefore she begins to enlighten men about woman she is is one of the worst developments of the general uglifying of europe beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https these clumsy attempts of feminine scientiﬁcality and bring to light woman has so much cause shame in woman there is so much pedantry superﬁciality schoolmasterliness petty presumption unbridledness and indiscretion only woman behaviour towards children has really been best restrained and dominated hitherto by the fear of man alas if ever the eternally tedious in woman has plenty of it allowed to venture forth if she begins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and charming of playing of frightening away sorrow of alleviating and taking easily if she forgets her delicate aptitude agreeable desires female voices are already raised which by saint aristophanes make one afraid medical explicitness it is stated in threatening manner what woman ﬁrst and last requires from man is it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to be scientiﬁc enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men affair men remained therewith among ourselves and in the end in view of all that women write about woman we may well have considerable doubt to whether woman really desires enlightenment about can desire it if woman does not thereby seek new ornament believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally feminine then she wishes to make herself feared perhaps she thereby wishes to get the mastery but she does not want does woman care truth from the very ﬁrst nothing is more foreign more repugnant or more hostile to woman than great art is falsehood her chief concern is appearance and beauty let us confess it we men we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in woman we who have the hard task and our recreation gladly seek the company of beings under whose hands glances and delicate follies our seriousness our gravity and profundity appear almost like follies to us finally i ask the question did woman herself ever acknowledge profundity in woman mind or justice in woman heart and is it not true that on the whole woman has hitherto been most despised by woman herself and not at all by us men desire that woman should not continue to compromise herself by enlightening us just it was man care and the consi deration woman when the church decreed mulier taceat in ecclesia it was to the beneﬁt of woman when napoleon gave the too eloquent madame stael to understand mulier taceat in politicis in my opinion he is true friend of woman who calls out to women today mulier taceat mulierel it betrays corruption of the from the fact that it betrays bad woman refers to madame roland or madame stael or monsieur geor ge sand though something were proved thereby in favour of woman she is among men these are the

will probably prove too short all fundamental questions of life future well present and will be unable to descend into any of the depths on the other hand man who has depth of spirit well of desires

oriental how necessary how logical even how humanely desirable this was let us consider ourselves the weaker sex has in previous age been treated with so much respect by men at belongs to the tendency and fundamental taste of democracy in the same way disrespectfulness to old wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of this respect they want more they learn to make claims the tribute of respect is at last felt to be nigh galling rivalry rights indeed actual strife itself would be preferred in word woman is losing modesty and let us immediately add that she is also losing taste she is unlearning to fear man but the woman who unlearns to fear sacriﬁces her most womanly instincts that woman should venture forward when the quality in more deﬁnitely the man in man longer either desired or fully developed is reasonable enough and also intelligible enough what is more difﬁcult to understand is that precisely deteriorates this is what is happening nowadays let us not deceive ourselves about it wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit woman strives the economic and legal independence of clerk woman clerkess is inscribed on the portal of the modern society which is in course of formation while she thus appropriates new rights aspires to be master and inscribes progress of woman on her ﬂags and banners the very opposite realises itself with terrible obviousness woman retrogrades since the french revolution the inﬂuence of woman in europe has declined in proportion she has increased her rights and claims and the emancipation of woman insofar it is desired and demanded by women themselves and not only by masculine thus proves to be remarkable symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly instincts there is stupidity in this movement an almost masculine stupidity of which is always sensible might be heartily ashamed to lose the intuition to the ground upon which she can most surely achieve victory to neglect exercise in the use of her proper weapons to before man perhaps even to the book where formerly she kept herself in control and in reﬁned artful humility to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man faith in veiled fundamentally different ideal in woman something eternally necessarily feminine to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved cared protected and indulged like some delicate strangely wild and often pleasant domestic animal the clumsy and indignant collection of everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of woman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and still entails though slavery were counter argument and not rather condition of every higher culture of every elevation of culture does all this betoken if not disintegration of womanly instincts defeminising certainly there are enough of idiotic friends and corrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex who advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner and to imitate all the stupidities from which man in europe european manliness suffers would like to lower woman to general culture indeed even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics here and there they beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https to make women into free spirits and literary workers though woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to profound and godless man everywhere her nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music our latest german music and she is daily being made more hysterical and more incapable of fulﬁlling her ﬁrst and last function that of bearing robust children they wish to cultivate her in general still more and intend they say to make the weaker sex strong by culture if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that the cultivating of mankind and his is to say the weakening dissipating and languishing of his force of ve always kept pace with one another and that the most powerful and inﬂuential women in the world and lastly the mother of napoleon had just to thank their force of not their their power and ascendancy over men that which inspires respect in woman and often enough fear also is her nature which is more natural than that of man her genuine cunning ﬂexibility her beneath the glove her naivete in egoism her untrainableness and innate wildness the incomprehensibleness extent and deviation of her desir es and virtues that which in spite of fear excites one sympathy the dangerous and beautiful cat woman is that she seems more afﬂicted more vulne rable more necessitous of love and more condemned to disillusionment than any other creature fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man has hitherto stood in the presence of woman always with one foot already in tragedy which rends while it and all that is now to be at an end and the disenchant ment of woman is in progress the tediousness

happiness and apartness considered how soon stronger one may become master of the strong and also that there is compensation the intellectual superﬁcialising of in the deepening of another whether we call it civilization or humanising or progress which now distinguishes the european whether we call it simply without praise or blame by the political formula the democra tic movement in behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by such formulas an immense physiological process goes on which is ever extending the process of the assimilation of europeans their increasing detachment from the conditions under which climatically and hereditarily united races originate their increasing independence of every deﬁnite milieu that centuries would fain inscribe itself with equal demands on soul and body that is to say the slow emer gence of an essentially tional and nomadic species of man who possesses physiologically speaking maximum of the art and power of adaptation his typical distinction this process of the evol ving european which can be retarded in its tempo by great relapses but will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehem ence and storm and stress of national sentiment pertains to it and also the anarchism which is appearing at process will probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators and panegyrists the apostles of modern ideas would least care to reckon the same new conditions under which on an average levelling and mediocrising of man will take useful industrious variously serviceable and clever gregarious in the highest degree suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and attractive qualities while the capacity adaptation which is every day trying changing conditions and begins new work with every generation almost with every decade makes the powerfulness of the type impossible while the collective impression of such futur europeans will probably be that of numerous talkative and very handy workmen who require master commander they require their daily bread while therefore the democratising of europe will tend to the production of beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https slaver y in the most subtle sense of the term the strong man will necessarily in individual and exceptional cases become stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever been owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling owing to the immense variety of practice art and disguise i meant to say that the democratising of europe is at the same time an involuntary arrangement the rearing of tyran the word in all its meanings even in its most spiritual sense i hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the constellation hercules and i hope that the men on this earth will like the sun and we foremost we good europeans there was time when it was customary to call germans deep by way of distinction but now that the most successful type of new germanism is covetous of quite other honours and perhaps misses smartness in all that has depth it is almost opportune and patriotic to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that commendation in short whether german depth is not at bottom something different and something from which thank god we are on the point of successfully ridding ourselves let us try then to relearn with regard to german depth the only thing necessary the purpose is little vivisection of the german german soul is above all manifold varied in its source aggregated and super rather than actually built this is owing to its origin german who would embolden himself to assert two souls alas dwell in my breast would make bad guess at the truth or more correctly he would come far short of the truth about the number of souls people made up of the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races perhaps even with preponderance of the element the people of the centre in every sense of the term the germans are more intangible more ample more contradictory more unknown more incalculable more surprising and even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves escape definition and are thereby alone the despair of the french it is characteristic of the germans that the question what is german never dies out among them kotzebue certainly knew his germans well enough we are known they cried jubilantly to sand also though t he knew them jean paul knew what he was doing when he declared himself incensed at fichte lying but patriotic ﬂatteries and exaggerations it is probable that goethe thought differently about germans from jean paul even though he acknowledged him to be right with regard to fichte it is question what goethe really thought about the germans about many things around him he never spoke explicitly and all his life he knew how to keep an astute he had good reason it it is certain that it was not the wars of independence that made him look up more joyfully any more than it was the french revolution event on account of which he reconstructed his faust and indeed the whole problem of man was the appearance of napoleon there are words of goethe in which he condemns with impatient severity from foreign land that which germans take pride in he once deﬁned the famous german turn of mind indulgence towards its own and others weaknesses was he wrong it is characteristic of germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them the german soul has passages and galleries in it there are caves laces and dungeons therein its disorder has much of the charm of the mysterious the german is well acquainted with the bypaths to chaos and everything loves its symbol so the german loves the clouds and all that is obscure evolving crepuscular damp and shrouded it seems to him that everything uncertain undeveloped and grow ing is deep the german himself does not exist he is becoming he is developing himself development is therefore the essentially german discovery and hit in the great domain of philosophical formulas ruling idea which together with german beer and german music is labouring to germanise all europe foreigners are astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conﬂicting nature at the basis of the germ an soul propounds to them riddles which hegel systematised and richard wagner has in the end set to music natured and spiteful juxtaposition preposterous in the case of every other people is unfortunately only too often justiﬁed in germany one has only to live while among swabians to know this the clumsiness of the german scholar and his social distastefulness agree alarmingly well with his physical and nimble boldness of which all the gods have learnt to be afraid if any one wishes to see the german soul demonstrated ad oculos let him only look at german taste at german arts and manners what boorish indifference to taste how the noblest and the commonest stand there in juxtaposit ion how disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution of this soul the german drags at his soul he drags at everything he experiences he digests his events badly he never gets done with them and german depth is often only difﬁcult hesitating digestion and just all chronic invalids all dyspeptics like what is convenient so the beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https frankness and honesty it is so convenient to be frank and honest conﬁdingness this complaisance this of german honesty is probably the most dangerous and most successful disguise which the german is up to nowadays it is his proper mephistophelean art with this he can still achieve much the german lets himself go and thereby gazes with faithful blue empty german other countries immediately confound him with his meant to say that let german depth be what it ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh at shall well to continue henceforth to honour its appearance and good name and not barter away too cheaply our old reputation people of depth prussian smartness and berlin wit and sand it is wise people to pose and let itself be regarded profound clumsy honest and foolish it might even to so finally we should honour to our are not called the tiusche volk deceptive people nothing the good old time is past it sang itself out in happy are we that his rococo still speaks to us that his good company his tender enthusiasm his childish delight in the chinese and its ﬂourishes his courtesy of heart his longing the elegant the amorous the tripping the tearful and his belief in the south can still appeal to something left in us ah some time or other it will be over with it who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with the intelligence and taste beethoven he was only the last echo of break and transition in style and not like mozart the last echo of great european taste which had existed centuries beethoven is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly breaking down and future soul that is always coming there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal extravagant hope same light in which europe was bathed when it dreamed with rousseau when it danced round the tree of liberty of the revolution and ﬁnally almost fell down in adoration before napoleon but how rapidly does this very sentiment now pale how difﬁcult nowadays is even the apprehension of this sentiment how strangely does the language of rousseau schiller shelley and byron sound to our ear in whom collectivel y the same fate of europe was able to speak which knew how to sing in beethoven german music came afterwards belongs to romanticism that is to say to movement which historically considered was still shorter more ﬂeeting and more superﬁcial than that great interlude the transition of europe from rousseau to napoleon and to the rise of democracy what we care nowadays freischutz and oberon or marschner hans heiling and vampyre or even wagner tannhauser that is extinct although not yet forgotten music this whole music of romanticism besides was not noble enough was not musical enough to maintain its position anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses from the beginning it was music which was little thought of by genuine musicians it was different with felix mendelssohn that halcyon master who on account of his lighter purer happier soul quickly acquired admiration and was equally quickly forgotten the beautiful episode of german music but with regard to robert schumann who took things seriously and has been taken seriously from the was the last that founded school we not now regard it satisfaction relief deliverance that this very romanticism of schumann has been surmounted schumann ﬂeeing into the saxon switzerland of his soul with half werther half nature assuredly not like beethoven assuredly not like byron manfred music is mistake and misunderstanding to the extent of injustice schumann with his taste which was fundamentally petty taste that is to say dangerous dangerous among quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings going constantly apart timidly withdrawing and retiring noble weakling who revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow from the beginning sort of girl and noli schumann was already merely german event in music and longer european event beethoven had been in still greater degree mozart had been with schumann german music was threatened with its greatest danger that of losing the voice the soul of europe and sinking into merely national af fair what torture are books written in german to reader who has third ear how indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp of sounds without tune and rhythms without dance which germans call book and even the german who reads books how lazily how reluctantly how badly he reads how many germans know and consider it obligatory to know that there is art in every good which must be divined if the sentence is to be understood if there is misunderstanding about its tempo instance the sentence itself is misunderstood that one must not be doubtful about the syllables that one should feel beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https of the symmetry intentional and charm that one should lend ﬁne and patient ear to every stacca to and every ruba to that one should divine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs and how delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of their among germans is complaisant enough to recognize such duties and requirements and to listen to so much art and intention in language after all one just has ear it and so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard and the most delicate artistry is it were squandered on the were my thoughts when i noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters in the art of have been confounded one whose words drop down hesitatingly and coldly from the roof of damp counts on their dull sound and echo and another who manipulates his language like ﬂexible sword and from his arm down into his toes feels the dangerous bliss of the quivering blade which wishes to bite hiss and cut how little the german style has to with harmony and with the ear is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians thems elves write badly the german does not read aloud he does not read the ear but only with his eyes he has put his ears away in the drawer the time in antiquity when man was seldom read something to himself and in loud voice they were surprised when any one read silently and sought secretly the reason of it in loud voice that is to say with all the swellings inﬂections and variations of key and changes of tempo in which the ancient public world took delight the laws of the written style were then the same those of the spoken style and these laws depended partly on the surprising development and reﬁned requirements of the ear and larynx partly on the strength endurance and power of the ancient lungs in the ancient sense period is above all physiological whole inasmuch it is comprised in one breath such periods occur in demosthenes and cicero swelling twice and sinking twice and all in one breath were pleasures to the men of antiquity who knew by their own schooling how to appreciate the virtue therein the rareness and the difﬁculty in the deliverance of such period have really right to the big period we modern men who are short of breath in every sense those ancients indeed were all of them dilettanti in speaking consequently connoisseurs consequently thus brought their orators to the highest pitch in the same manner in the last century when all italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing the virtuosoship of song and with it also the art of melody reached its elevation in germany however until quite recently when kind of platform eloquence began shyly and awkwardly enough to ﬂutter its young wings there was properly speaking only one kind of public and approxima tely artistical delivered from the pulpit the preacher was the only one in germany who knew the weight of syllable or word in what manner sentence strikes springs rushes ﬂows and comes to close he alone had conscience in his ears often enough bad conscience reasons are not lacking why proﬁcien cy in oratory should be especially seldom attained by german or almost always too late the masterpiece of german prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of its greatest preacher the bible has hitherto been the best german book compared with luther bible almost everything else is merely literature which has not grown in germany and therefore has not taken and does not take root in german hearts the bible has done there are two kinds of geniuses one which above all engenders and seeks to engender and another which willingly lets itself be fructiﬁed and brings forth and similarly among the gifted nations there are those on whom the woman problem of pregnancy has devolved and the secret task of forming maturing and perfectin greeks instance were nation of this kind and so are the french and others which have to fructify and become the cause of new modes of like the jews the romans and in all modesty be it asked like the germans tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and irresistibly forced out of themselves amor ous and longing foreign races such let themselves be fructiﬁed and withal imperious like everything conscious of being full of generative force and consequently empowered by the grace of god these two kinds of geniuses seek each other like man and woman but they also misunderstand each man and woman every nation has its own tartuffery and calls that its does not can not know the best that is in one what europe owes to the jews things good and bad and above all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst the grand style in morality the fearful ness and majesty of inﬁnite demands of inﬁnite signiﬁcations the whole romanticism and sublimity of beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https consequently just the most attractive ensnaring and exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to life in the aftersheen of which the sky of our european culture its evening sky now erhaps glows out this we artists among the spectators and philosophers to the jews it must be taken into the bargain if various clouds and short slight attacks of over the spirit of people that suffers and wants to suffer from national nervous fever and political ambition instance among german s there is alternately the folly the folly the folly the folly the wagnerian folly the teutonic folly the prussian folly just look at those poor historians the sybels and treitschkes and their closely banda ged heads and whatever else these little obscurations of the german spirit and conscience may be called may it be forgiven that i too when on short daring sojourn on very infected ground did not remain wholly exempt from the disease but like every one else began to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern ﬁrst symptom of political infection about the jews instance listen to the following have never yet met german who was favourably inclined to the jews and however decided the repudiation of actual may be on the part of all prudent and political men this prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the sentiment itself but only against its dangerous excess and especially against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of sentiment this point we must not deceive ourselves that germany has amply sufficient jews that the german stomach the german blood has difﬁcu lty and will long have difﬁculty in disposing only of this quantity of jew the italian the frenchman and the englishman have done by means of stronger digestion is the unmistakable declaration and language of general instinct to which one must listen and according to which one must act let more jews come in and shut the doors especially towards the east also towards austria commands the instinct of people whose nature is still feeble and uncertain so that it could be easily wiped out easily extinguished by stronger race the jews however are beyond all doubt the strongest toughest and purest race at present living in europe they know how to succeed even under the worst conditions in fact better than under favourable ones by means of virtues of some sort which one would like nowadays to label above all to resolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before modern ideas they alter only when they alter in the same way that the russian empire makes its an empire that has plenty of time and is not of yesterday according to the principle slowly possible thinker who has the future of europ at heart will in all his perspectives concerning the future calculate upon the jews he will calculate upon the russians above all the surest and likeliest factors in the great play and battle of forces that which is at present called nation in europe and is really rather res fact than nata indeed sometimes confusingly similar to res fict et pict is in every case something evolving young easily displaced and not yet race much less such race aere perennus the jews are such nations should most carefully avoid all rivalr y and hostility it is certain that the jews if they if they were driven to it the seem to could now have the ascendancy nay literally the supremacy over europe that they are not working and planning that end is equally certain meanwhile they rather wish and desire even somewhat importunely to be insorbed and absorbed by europe they long to be ﬁnally settled authorized and respected somewhere and wish to put an end to the nomadic life to the wandering jew one should certainly take account of this impulse and tendency and make adv ances to it it possibly betokens mitigation of the jewish instincts which purpose it would perhaps be useful and fair to banish the bawlers out of the country one should make advances with all prudence and with selection pretty much the english nobility it stands to reason that the more powerful and strongly marked types of new germanism could enter into relation with the jews with the least hesitation instance the nobleman ofﬁcer from the prussian border it would be interesting in many ways to see whether the genius money and patience and especially some intellect and lacking in the place referred to could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of commanding and both of which the country in question has now classic reputation but here it is exped ient to break off my festal discourse and my sprightly teutonomania i have already reached my serious topic the european problem i understand it the rearing of new ruling caste europe they are not philosophical english bacon represents an attack on the philosophical spirit generally hobbes hume and locke an abasement and depreciation of beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https of philosopher more than century it was against hume that kant uprose and raised himself it was locke of whom schelling rightl y said je meprise locke in the struggle against the english mechanical stultiﬁcation of the world hegel and schopenhauer along with goethe were of one accord the two hostile brother in philosophy who pushed in different directions towards the opposite poles of german thought and thereby wronged each other only brothers will is lacking in england and has always been lacking that and rhetorician knew well enough the absurd carlyle who soug ht to conceal under passionate grimaces what he knew about himself namely what was lackin g in power of intellect real depth of intellectual perception in short philosophy it is characteristic of such an unphilosophical race to hold on ﬁrmly to need its discipline moralizing and humanizing the englishman more gloomy sensual headstrong and brutal than the that very reason the baser of the two also the most pious he has all the more need of christianity to ﬁner nostrils this english christianity itself has still characteristic english taint of spleen and alcoholic excess which owing to good reasons it is used an ﬁner poison to neutralize the coarser ﬁner form of poisoning is in fact step in advance with people step towards spiritualiz ation the english coarseness and rustic demureness is still most satisfactorily disguised by chris tian pantomime and by praying and or more correctly it is thereby explained and differently expressed and the herd of drunkards and rakes who formerly learned moral grunting under the inﬂuence of methodism and more recently the salvation army penitential ﬁt may really be the relatively highest manifestation of humanity to which they can be elevated so much may reasonably be admitted that however which offends even in the humanest englishman is his lack of music to speak ﬁguratively and also literally he has neither rhythm nor dance in the movements of his soul and body indeed not even the desire rhythm and dance music listen to him speaking look at the most beautiful englishwoman country on earth are there more beautiful doves and swans ﬁnally listen to them singing but i ask too much there are truths which are best recognized by mediocre minds because they are best adapted them there are truths which only possess charms and seductive power mediocre spirits is pushed to this probably unpleasant conclusion now that the inﬂuence of respectable but mediocre may mention darwin john stuart mill and herbert begins to gain the ascendancy in the region of european taste indeed who could doubt that it is useful thing such minds to have the ascen dancy time it would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently soaring minds specially qualiﬁed determining and collecting many little common facts and deducing conclusions from them exceptions they are rather from the ﬁrst in very favourable position towards those who are the rules after all they have more to than merely to perceive effect they have to be something new they have to signify something new they have to represen t new values the gulf between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater and also more mysterious than one thinks the capable man in the grand style the creator will possibly have to be an ignorant person on the other hand scientiﬁc discoveries like those of darwin certain narrowness aridity and industrious carefulness in short something english may not be unfavo urable arriving at let it not be forgotten that the english with their profound mediocrity brought about once before general depression of european intelligence what is called modern ideas or the ideas of the eighteenth century or french ideas consequently against which the german mind rose up with profound of english origin there is doubt about it the french were only the apes and actors of these ideas their best soldiers and likewise alas their ﬁrst and profoundest victims owin g to the diabolical anglomania of modern ideas the ame francais has in the end become so thin and emaciated that at present one recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries its profound passionate strength its inventive excellency almost with disbelief one must however maintain this verdict of historical justice in determined manner and defend it against present prejudices and appearances the european sentiment taste and manners taking the word in every high the work and invention of france the european ignobleness the plebeianism of modern is england work and invention even at present france is still the seat of the most intellectual and reﬁned culture of europe it is still the high school of taste but one must know how to ﬁnd this france of taste he who belongs to it keeps himself well concealed may be small number in whom it lives and beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https besides perhaps being men who not stand upon the strongest legs in part fatalists hypochondriacs invalids in part persons such have the ambition to conceal themselves they have all something in common they keep their ears closed in presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic bourgeois in fact besotted and brutalized france at present sprawls in the recently celebrated veritable orgy of bad taste and at the same time of at the funeral of victor hugo there is also something else common to them predilection to resist intellectual still greater inability to so in this france of intellect which is also france of pessimism schopenhauer has perhaps become more at home and more indigenous than he has ever been in germany not to speak of heinrich heine who has long ago been in the more reﬁned and fastidious lyrists of paris or of hegel who at present in the form of first of living an almost tyrannical inﬂuence regards richard wagner however the more french music learns to adapt itself to the actual needs of the ame moderne the more will it wagnerite one can safely predict that beforehand is already taking place sufﬁciently there are however three things which the french can still boast of with pride their heritage and possession and indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority in europe in spite of all voluntary or involunta ry germanizing and vulgarizing of taste firstl y the capacity artistic emotion devotion to form which the expression t pour t along with numerous others has been invented capacity has not been lacking in france three centuries and owing to its reverence the small number it has again and again made sort of chamber music of literature possible which is sought in vain elsewhere in second thing whereby the french can lay claim to superiority over europe is their ancient moralistic culture owing to which one ﬁnds on an average even in the petty romanciers of the newspapers and chance boulev ardiers paris psychological sensitiveness and curiosity of which example one has conception to say nothing of the thing itself in germany the germ ans lack couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisite thereto which we have said france has not grudged those who call the germans naive on that account give them commendation defect the opposite of the german inexperience and innocence in volupt ate psychologica which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness of german intercourse the most successful expression of genuine french curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate thrills henri beyle may be noted that remarkable anticipatory and forerunning man who with napoleonic tempo traversed his europe in fact several centuries of the european soul surveyor and discoverer thereof has required two generations to over take him one way or other to divine long afterwards some of the riddles that perplexed and enraptured strange epicurean and man of interrogation the last great psychologist of france is yet third claim to superiority in the french character there is successful synthesis of the north and south which makes them comprehend many things and enjoins upon them other things which an englishman can never comprehend their temperament turned alternately to and from the south in which from time to time the provencal and ligurian blood froths over preserves them from the dreadful northern from sunless and from poverty of german inﬁrmity of taste the excessive prevalence of which at the present moment blood and iron that is to say high politics has with great resolution been prescribed according to dangerous healing art which bids wait and wait but not yet hope is also still in france and ready welcome those rarer and rarely gratiﬁed men who are too comprehensive to ﬁnd satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism and know how to love the south when in the north and the north when in the born midlanders the good europeans them bizet has made music this latest genius who has seen new beauty and seduction who has discovered piece of the south in music i hold that many precautions should be taken against german music suppose person loves the south i love great school of recovery the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills boundless solar profusion and effulgence which sovereign existence believing in such person will learn to be somewhat on his guard against german music because in injuring his taste anew it will also injure his health anew such southerner southerner not by origin but by belief if he should dream of the future of music must also dream of it being freed from the inﬂuence of the north and must have in his ears the prelude to deeper mightier and perhaps more perverse and mysterious music super music which does not fade pale beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https away all german music does at the sight of the blue wanton sea and the mediterranean clearness of super music which holds its own even in presence of the brown sunsets of the desert whose soul is akin to the and can be at home and can roam with big beautiful lonely beasts of prey i could imagine music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew nothing more of good and evil only that here and there perhaps some sailor some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might sweep lightly over it an art which from the far distance would see the colours of sinking and almost incomprehensible moral world ﬂeeing towards it and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to receive such belated fugitives owing to the morbid estrangement which the has induced and still induces among the nations of europe owing also to the and politicians who with the help of this craze are at present in power and not suspect to what extent the disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable at present the most unmistakable signs that europe wishes to be one are now overlooked or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted with all the more profound and men of this century the real general tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the way that new synthesis and tentatively to anticipate the european of the future only in their simulations or in their weaker moments in old age perhaps did they belong to the fatherlands only rested from themselves when they became patri ots i think of such men napoleon goethe beethoven stendhal heinrich heine schopenhauer it must not be taken amiss if i also count richard wagner among them about whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselves still less of course by the unseemly noise with which he is now resisted and opposed in france the fact remains nevertheless that richard wagner and the later french romanticism of the forties are most closely and intimately related to one another they are akin fundamentally akin in all the heights and depths of their requirements it is europe the one europe whose soul presses urgently and longingly outwards and upwards in their multifarious and boisterous into new light towards new sun but who would attempt to express accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could not express distinctly it is certain that the same storm and stress tormented them that they sought in the same manner these last great seekers all of them steeped in literature to their eyes and ﬁrst artists of universal literary the most part even themselves writers poets intermediaries and blenders of the arts and the senses wagner musician is reckoned among painters poet among musicians artist generally among actors all of them fanatics expression at any cost specially mention delacroix the nearest related to wagner all of them great discoverers in the realm of the sublime also of the loathsome and dreadful still greater discoverers in effect in display in the art of the all of them talented far beyond their genius out and out virtuosi with mysterious accesses to all that seduces allures constrains and upsets born enemies of logic and of the straight line hankering after the strange the exotic the monstrous the crooked and the men tantaluses of the will plebeian parvenu s who knew themselves to be incapable of noble tempo or of lent in life and of balzac instance ned workers almost destroying themselves by work antinomians and rebels in manners ambitious and insatiable without equilibrium and enjoyment all of them ﬁnally shattering and sinking down at the christian cross and with right and reason who of them would have been sufﬁciently profound and sufﬁciently original an philosophy the whole boldly daring splendidly overbearing and class of higher men who had ﬁrst to teach their it is the century of the conception higher let the german friends of richard wagner advise together to whether there is anything purely german in the wagnerian art or whether its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from german sources and impulses in which connection it may not be underrate d how indispensable paris was to the development of his type which the strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most decisive how the whole style of his proceedings of his could only perfect itself in sight of the french socialistic original on more subtle comparison it will perhaps be found to the honour of richard wagner german nature that he has acted in everything with more strength daring severity and elevation than frenchman could have to the circumstance that we germans are yet nearer to barbarism than the french perhaps even the most remarkable creation of richard wagner is not only at present but ever inaccessible incomprehensible and inimitable to the whole latter latin race the ﬁgure of siegfried that ver y free man who is probably far too free too hard too cheerful too healthy beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https tholic the taste of old and mellow civilized nations he may even have been sin against romanticism this siegfried well wagner atoned amply this sin in his old sad days taste which has meanwhile passed into he began with the religious vehemence peculiar to him to preach at least the way to rome if not to walk these last words may not be misunderstood i will call to my aid few powerful rhymes which will even betray to less delicate ears what i i mean counter to the last wagner and his parsifal music this our mode german heart came this vexed ululating from german body this is ours this priestly this exaltation is ours this faltering falling shambling this quite uncertain this sly ringing this wholly false enraptured this our mode well still wait what ye hear is f aith by intuition chapter ix wha t is noble ever y elevation of the type man has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always society believing in long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings and requiri ng slavery in some form or other without the pathos of dist ance such grows out of the incarnated difference of classes out of the constant looking and of the ruling caste on subordinates and instruments and out of their equally constant practice of obeying and commanding of keeping down and keeping at that other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen the longing an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself the formation of ever higher rarer further more extended more comprehensive states in short just the elevation of the type man the continued of man to use moral formula in supermoral sense to be sure one must not resign oneself to any humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin of an aristocratic society that is to say of the preliminary condition the elevation of the type man the truth is hard let us acknowledge unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has origina ted men with still natural nature barbarians in every terrible sense of the word men of prey still in possession of unbroken strength of will and desire power threw themselves upon weaker more moral more peaceful races perhaps trading or communities or upon old mellow civilizations in which the ﬁnal vital force was ﬂickering out in brilliant ﬁreworks of wit and depravity at the commencement the noble caste was always the barbarian caste their superiority did not consist ﬁrst of all in their physical but in their psychical were more complete men which at every point also implies the same more complete beasts the indication that anarchy threatens to break out among the instincts and that the foundation of the emotions called life is something radically different according to the organization in which it manifests itself when instance an aristocracy like that of france at the beginning of the revo lution ﬂung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacriﬁced itself to an excess of its moral sentiments it was corruption was really only the closing act of the corruption which had existed centuries by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its lordly prerogatives and lowered itself to function of royalty in the end even to its decoration and the essential thing however in good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard itself function either of the kingship or the commonwealth but the significance and highest justiﬁcation it should therefore accept with good conscience the sacriﬁce of legion of individuals who its sake must be suppressed and reduced to imperfect men to slaves and instruments its fundamental belief must be precisely that society is not allowed to exist its own sake but only foundation and scaffolding by means of which select class of beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties and in general to higher existence like those climbing plants in are called sipo matador encircle an oak so long and so often with their arms until at last high above it but supported by it they can unfold their tops in the open light and exhibit their beyond good and evil by

individuals when the necessary conditions are given namely the actual similarity of the individuals in amount of force and degree of worth and their within one organization soon however one wished to take this principle more generally and if possible even the fundament al principle of society it would immediately disclose what it really will to the denial of life principle of dissolution and decay here one must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental weakness life itself is essentiall y appropriation injury conquest of the strange and weak suppression severity obtrusion of peculiar forms incorporation and at the least putting it mildest exploitation why should one ever use precisely these words on which ages disparaging purpose has been stamped even the organization within which was previously supposed the individuals treat each other takes place in every healthy itself if it be living and not dying organization all that towards other bodies which the individuals within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the incarnated will to power it will endeavour to grow to gain ground attract to itself and acquire owing to any morality or immorality but because it lives and because life is precisely will to power on point however is the ordinary consciousness of europeans more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter people now rave everywhere even under the guise of science about coming conditions of society in which the exploiting character is to be sounds to my ears if they promised to invent mode of life which should refrain from all organic functions exploitation does not belong to depraved or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of the living being primary organic function it is consequence of the intrinsic will to power which is precisely the will to that theory this is reality it is the fundament al fact of all history let us be so far honest towards ourselves in tour through the many ﬁner and coarser moralities which have hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth i found certain traits recurring regularly together and connected with one another until ﬁnally two primary types revealed themselves to and radical distinction was brought to light there is rality and would at once add however that in all higher and mixed civilizations there are also attempts at the reconciliation of the two moralities but one ﬁnds still oftener the confusion and mutual misund erstanding of them indeed sometimes their close in the same man within one soul the distinctions of moral values have either originated in ruling caste pleasantly conscious of being different from the among the ruled class the slaves and dependents of all sorts in the ﬁrst case when it is the rulers who determine the conception good it is the exalted proud disposition which is regarded the distinguishing feature and that which determines the order of rank the noble type of man separates from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted proud disposition displays itself he despises them let it at once be noted that in this ﬁrst kind of morality the antithesis good and bad means practically the same noble and despicable antithesis good and evil is of different origin the cowardly the timid the insigniﬁcant and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised moreover also the distrustful with their constrained glances the the kind of men who let themselves be abused the mendicant ﬂatterers and above all the liars is fundamental belief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful we truthful ones nobility in ancient greece called themselves it is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at ﬁrst applied to men and were only derivatively and at later period applied to actions it is gross mistake therefore when historians of morals start with questions like why have sympathetic actions been praised the noble type of man regards himself determiner of values he does not require to be approved of he passes the judgment what is injurious to is injurious in itself he knows that it is he himself only who confers honour on things he is crea tor of values he honours whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equals in the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude of power which seeks to overﬂow the happiness of high tension the consciousness of wealth which would fain give and bestow noble man also helps the unfortunate but of pity but rather from an impulse generated by the super abundance of power the noble man honours in himself the powerful one him also who has power over himself who knows how to speak and how to keep silence who takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness and has reverence all that is severe and hard wotan placed hard heart in my breast says an old scandinavian saga it is thus rightly expres sed from the soul beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https proud viking such type of man is even proud of not being made sympathy the hero of the saga therefore adds warningly he who has not hard heart when young will never have one the noble and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality which sees precisely in sympathy or in acting the good of others or in desinteressement the characteristic of the moral faith in oneself pride in oneself radical enmity and irony towards selﬂessness belong deﬁnitely to noble morality careless scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the warm heart is the powerful who know how to honour it is their art their domain invention the profound reverence age and law rests on this double reverence belief and prejudice in favour of ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers is typical in the morality of the powerful and if reversely men of modern ideas believe almost instinctively in progress and the future and are more and more lacking in respect old age the ignoble origin of these ideas has complacently betrayed itself thereby morality of the ruling class however is more especially foreign and irritating to taste in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to one equals that one may act towards beings of lower rank towards all that is foreign just seems good to one or the heart desires and in any case beyond good and evil it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have place the ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged only within the circle of equals artfulness in retaliation raffinement of the idea in friendship certain necessity to have enemies outlets the emotions of envy quarrelsomeness fact in order to be good friend all these are typical characteristics of the noble morality which has been pointed out is not the morality of modern ideas and is therefore at present difﬁcult to realize and also to unearth and is otherwise with the second type of morality supposing that the abused the oppressed the suffering the unemancipated the weary and those uncertain of themselves should moralize what will be the common element in their moral estimates probably pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will ﬁnd expression perhaps condemnation of man togeth er with his situation the slave has an unfavourable eye the virtues of the powerful he has skepticism and distrust refinement of distrust of everything good that is there honoure would fain persuade himself that the very happiness there is not genuine on the other hand those qualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into prominence and ﬂooded with light it is here that sympathy the kind helping hand the warm heart patience diligence humility and friendliness attain to honour here these are the most useful qualities and almost the only means of supporting the burden of existence is essentially the morality of utility here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evil and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which not admit of being despised according to therefore the evil man arouses fear according to master it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the bad man is regarded the despicable being the contrast attains its maximum when in accordanc with the logical consequences of shade of may be slight and last attaches itself to the good man of this morality because according to the servile mode of thought the good man must in any case be the safe man he is easily deceived perhaps little stupid un bonhomm everywhere that gains the ascendancy language shows tendency to approxim ate the signiﬁcations of the words good and stupid last fundamental difference the desire freedom the instinct happiness and the reﬁnements of the feeling of liberty belong necessarily to and mora lity artiﬁce and enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an aristocra tic mode of thinking and we can understand without further detail why love is our european absolutely be of noble origin is well known its invention is due to the provencal those brilliant ingenious men of the gai saber to whom europe owes so much and almost owes itself vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difﬁcult noble man to understand he will be tempted to deny it where anoth er kind of man thinks he sees it the problem him is to represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse good opinion of themselves which they themselves not consequently also not deserve who yet believe in this good opinion afterwards this seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so disrespectful and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable that he would like to consider vanity an exception and is doubtful about it in most cases when it is spoken of he will say instance i may be mistaken about my value and on the other hand may nevertheless demand beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https value should be acknowledged by others precisely i rate it however is not vanity but or in most cases that which is called and also or he will even say many reasons i can delight in the good opinion of others perhaps because i love and honour them and rejoice in all their joys perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps because the good opinion of others even in cases where i not share it is useful to or gives promise of usefulness all this however is not vanity the man of noble character must ﬁrst bring it home forcibly to his mind especially with the aid of history that from time immemorial in all social strata in any way dependent the ordinary man was only that which he passed being at all accustomed to ﬁx values he did not assign even to himself any other value than that which his master assigned to him it is the peculiar right of masters to create values it may be looked upon the result of an extraordinary atavism that the ordinary man even at present is still always waiting an opinion about himself and then instinctively submitting himself to it yet by means only to good opinion but also to bad and unjust one think instance of the greater part of the and which believing women learn from their confessors and which in general the believing christian learns from his church in fact conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and its cause the blending of the blood of masters and slaves the originally noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign value to themselves and to think well of themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but it has at all times an older ampler and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity overmasters the younger the vain person rejoices over ever y good opinion which he hears about himself quite apart from the point of view of its usefulness and equally regardless of its truth or falsehood just he suffers from every bad opinion he subjects himself to both he feels himself subjected to both by that oldest instinct of subjection which breaks forth in is the slave in the vain man blood the remains of the slave how much of the slave is still left in woman instance seeks to seduce to good opinions of itself it is the slave too who immediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions though he had not called them to repeat it again vanity is an atavism species originates and type becomes established and strong in the long struggle with essentially constant unf avourable conditions on the other hand it is known by the experience of breeders that species which receive super nourishment and in general surplus of protection and care immediately tend in the most marked way to develop variations and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities also in monstrous vices now look at an aristocratic commonwealth say an ancient greek polis or venice voluntary or involuntary contrivance the purpose of rearing human beings there are there men beside one another thrown upon their own resources who want to make their species prevail chieﬂy because they must prevail or else run the terrible danger of being exterminated the favour the super the protection are there lacking under which variations are fostered the species needs itself species something which precisely by virtue of its hardness its uniformity and simplicity of structure can in general prevail and make itself permanent in constant struggle with its neighbours or with rebellious or threatening vassals the most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists in spite of all gods and men and has hitherto been victorious these qualities it calls virtues and these virtues alone it develops to maturity it does so with severity indeed it desires severity every aristocratic morality is intoleran t in the education of youth in the control of women in the marriage customs in the relations of old and young in the penal laws which have an eye only the degenerating it counts intolerance itself among the virtues under the name of justice type with few but very marked features species of severe warlike wisely silent reserved and reticent men and such with the most delicate sensibility the charm and nuances of society is thus established unaffected by the vicissitudes of generations the constant struggle with uniform unf avourable conditions is already remarked the cause of type becoming stable and hard finally however happy state of things results the enormous tension is relaxed there are perhaps more enemies among the neighbouring peoples and the means of life even

recesses of their desires and volitions what will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach they discover these sharp onlookers and loafers that the end is quickly approaching that

religious formula with new and deeper is some fundamental certainty which noble soul has about itself something which is not to be sough t is not to be found and perhaps also is not to be noble soul has reverence itself there are men who are unavoidably intellectual let them turn and twist themselves they will and hold their hands before their treacherous though the hand were not betrayer it always comes out at last that they have something which they intellect one of the subtlest means of deceiving at least long possible and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider than one really in everyday life is often desirable an umbrella called enthusiasm including what belongs to it instance virtue galiani said who was obliged to know it ver est enthousiasme in the writings of recluse one always hears something of the echo of the wilderness something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilance of solitude in his strongest words even in his cry itself there sounds new and more dangerous kind of silence of concealment he who has sat day and night from year end to year end alone with his soul in familiar discord and discourse he who has become or treasu or and dragon in his may be labyrinth but can also be ideas themselves eventually acquire colour of their own and an odour much of the depth of the mould something uncommunicative and repulsive which blows chilly upon every passer the recluse does not believe that that philosopher has always in the ﬁrst place been recluse expressed his actual and ultimat opinions in books are not books written precisely to hide what is in us he will doubt whether philosopher can have ultimate and actual opinions at all whether behind every cave in him there is not and must necessarily be still deeper cave an ampler stranger richer world beyond the surface an abyss behind every bottom beneath every foundation every philosophy is foreground is recluse verdict there is something arbitrary in the fact that the philosopher came to stand here took beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https looked around that he here laid his spade aside and did not dig any is also something suspicious in it every philosophy also conceals philosophy every opinion is also every word is also mask every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being misunderstood the latter perhaps wounds his vanity but the former wounds his heart his sympathy which always says ah why would you also have hard time of it i have man complex mendacious artful and inscrutable animal uncanny to the other animals by his artiﬁce and sagacity rather than by his strength has invented the good conscience in order ﬁnally to enjoy his soul something simple and the whole of morality is long audacious falsiﬁcation by virtue of which generall y enjoyment at the sight of the soul becomes possible from this point of view there is perhaps much more in the conception of art than is generally believed philosopher that is man who constantly experiences sees hears suspects hopes and dreams extraordinary things who is struck by his own thoughts if they came from the outside from above and below species of events and peculiar to him who is perhaps himself storm pregnant with new lightnings portentous man around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and something uncanny going on philosopher alas being who often runs away from himself is often afraid of whose curiosity always makes him come to himself again man who says i like that i take it my own and mean to guard and protect it from every one man who can conduct case carry out resolution remain true to an opinion keep hold of woman punish and overthrow insolence man who has his indignation and his sword and to whom the weak the suffering the oppressed and even the animals willingly submit and naturally belong in short man who is master by such man has sympathy well tha t sympathy has value but of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer or of those even who preach sympathy there is nowadays throughout almost the whole of europe sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain and also repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining an effeminizing which with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense seeks to deck itself out something here is regular cult of suffering the unmanliness of that which is called sympathy by such groups of visionaries is always i believe the ﬁrst thing that strikes the must resolutely and radically taboo this latest form of bad taste and ﬁnally i wish people to put the good amulet gai saber gay science in ordinary language on heart and neck protection against it the olympian the philosopher who genuine englishman tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking laughing is bad inﬁrmity of human nature which every thinking mind will strive to overcome hobbes would even allow myself to rank philosophers according to the quality of their to those who are capable of golden laughter and supposing that gods also philosophize which i am strongly inclin ed to believe owing to many have doubt that they also know how to laugh thereby in an and new at the expense of all serious things gods are fond of ridicule it seems that they can not refrain from laughter even in holy matters the genius of the heart that great mysterious one possesses it the tempter and born of consciences whose voice can descend into the nether of every soul who neither speaks word nor casts glance in which there may not be some motive or touch of allurement to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how to appear he is but in guise which acts an additional constraint on his followers to press ever closer to him to follow him more cordially and thoroughly genius of the heart which imposes silence and attention on everything loud and which smoothes rough souls and makes them taste new lie placid mirror that the deep heavens may be reﬂected in them genius of the heart which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate and to grasp more delicately which scents the hidden and forgotten treasure the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark ice and is every grain of gold long buried and imprisoned in mud and sand the genius of the heart from contact with which every one goes away richer not favoured or surprised not though gratiﬁed and oppressed by the good things of others but richer in himself newer than before broken up blown upon and sounded by thawing wind more uncertain perhaps more delicate more fragile more bruised but full of hopes which yet lack names full of new will and current full of new and counter but what am i doing my friends beyond good and evil by friedrich nietzsche https whom am i talking to you have i forgotten myself so far that i have not even told you his name unless it be that you have already divined of your own accord who this questionable god and spirit is that wishes to be praised in such manner it happens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on his legs and in foreign lands i have also encountered on my path many strange and dangerous spirits above all however and again and again the one of whom i have just spoken in fact less personage than the god dionysus the great equivocator and tempter to whom you know i once offered in all secrecy and reverence my last it seems to who has offered sacrifice to him i have found one who could understand what i was then doing in the meantime however i have learned much far too much about the philosophy of this god and i said from mouth to the last disciple and initiate of the god dionysus and perhaps i might at last begin to give you my friends far i am allowed little taste of this philosophy in hushed voice is but seemly it has to with much that is secret new strange wonderful and uncanny the very fact that dionysus is philosopher and that therefore gods also philosophize seems to novelty which is not unensnaring and might perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers you my friends there is less to be said against it except that it comes too late and not at the right time it has been disclosed to you are loth nowadays to believe in god and gods it may happen too that in the frankness of my story i must go further than is agreeable to the strict usages of your ears certainly the god in question went further very much further in such dialogues and was always many paces ahead of indeed if it were allowed i should have to give him according to human usage ﬁne ceremonious tides of lustre and merit i should have to extol his courage investigator and discoverer his fearless honesty truthfulness and love of wisdom but such god does not know what to with all that respectable trumpery and pomp keep that he would say thyself and those like thee and whoever else require it reason to cover my nakedness one suspects that this kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame once said under certain circumstances i love mankind referred thereby to ariadne who was present in my opinion man is an agreeable brave inventive animal that has not his equal upon earth he makes his way even through all labyrinths i like man and often think how i can still further advance him and make him stronger more evil and more profound stronger more evil and more profound i asked in horror yes he said again stronger more evil and more profound also more beautiful thereby the tempter smiled with his halcyon smile though he had just paid some charming compliment one here sees at once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks in general there are good grounds supposing that in some things the gods could all of them come to us men instruction we men alas what are you after all my written and painted thoughts not long ago you were so variegated young and malicious so full of thorns and secret spices that you made sneeze and now you have already doffed your novelty and some of you i fear are ready to become truths so immortal they look so pathetically honest so tediou s and was it ever otherwise what then we write and paint we mandarins with chinese brush we immortalisers of things which lend themselves to writing what are we alone capable of painting alas only that which is just about to fade and begins to lose its odour alas only exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow sentiments alas only birds strayed and fatigued by ﬂight which now let themselves be captured with the our hand we immortalize what can not live and ﬂy much longer things only which are exhausted and mellow and it is only your afternoon you my written and painted thoughts which alone i have colours many colours perhaps many variegated softenings and ﬁfty yellows and browns and greens
