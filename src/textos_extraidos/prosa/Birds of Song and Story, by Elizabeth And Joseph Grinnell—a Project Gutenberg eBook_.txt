among rocks or fallen trees having the forethought to wear plainly colored clothes and moveless the neighboring objects one may be treated to such feast of sounds will both surprise and entertain him the birds will come close and even hop over one coat sleeves and shoes though so much wink may dissipate the charm just before bedtime there are whisperings and salutes and conversations and love

never forgets and if one chance to remain late at night one may often hear some feathered person mumble or talk or scold or complain or sing short melody in his sleep some students of suggest that

she has learned so well to hear what her sight might deprive her of when once the ear has learned its better lessons glimpses so to speak of bird life ﬂutter to it naturally leaves ﬂutter to the sward in autumn it is the continual chatter chatter that deprives many of us of the best enjoyme nts of life we talk when we should listen nature speaks low more often than she shouts taciturn child or person ﬁnds out things that are worth the habit of keeping still to know these remarks are in the interest of singing birds bird is sometimes interrupted and comes to sudden stop footstep word laugh and the very next note is swallowed by the singer by studying our songsters one may come to know one self how individuals differ even among the same species there is the phœbe even she forgets her customary dismal cry at certain times when ﬂies are winging their midday dance on invisible ﬂoors that never were waxed it is when she takes ﬂat stand an the and bewails her lot that her notes are utterly disconsolate take couple of phœbes on cloudy day just after one folks have gone away from home on long visit and nothing lends an aid to sorrow like their melancholy notes really we believe phœbe thinks he is singing but he has mistaken his calling some of the goldﬁnches have plaintive note especially while nesting which appeals to the gloomy side of the listener if he chance to have such side were coleridge listening to either of these the phœbe or the goldﬁnch he would doubtless say in answer to the char ge of sadness melancholy bird oh idle thought in nature there is nothing melancholy and he would have us believe the birds are merry when they sing and so they shall be merry even the mourning dove shall make us glad she does not intend to mourn the appearance of sadness being only the cadence of her natural voice she has not learned the art of modulation though the bluebird and the robin and all the thrushes call her attention to the matter every year if one will closely watch singer unbeknown to him when he is in the very act one may note the varying expression of the body from the tip of his beak to the tip of his tail sometimes he will stand still with closely ﬁtting plumage and whole attitude on tiptoe sometimes he will crouch and lift the plumage and gyrate gracefully or ﬂutter or soar off at random on quick wings sometimes he sings ﬂat on the breast like or again high up in the sky like the lark however he sings heaven bless the singer the earth would be cheerless place were there more of these but legend tells the story of singing birds in its own story of time long long eons ago when not single bird made glad the heart of anything or anybody true there were some large sea birds and great walking land birds too deformed any one to recognize birds in these days but there was such thing singing bird one day there came great spring freshet the greatest freshet ever dreamed of and all the land animals sought shelter in the trees and high mountains but the water came up to the peaks and over the treetops and sorrow was in all the world suddenly giraffe stretc hing its long neck 11 12 13 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https all directions espied big boat roofed over like house the giraffe made signs to the elephant and the elephant gave the signal elephants to this day give signals that are heard many mile so they say then there came scurrying the big boat few of all the animals got on board by hook or crook and the rain was coming down in sheets all at once along came the lizards crawling up the sides of the boat and hunting cracks and to crawl into just lizards are in the habit of doing on the sly to this day but not crack or hole could they ﬁnd in the boat side the loose places wide enough lizard to ﬂatten himself into had all been ﬁlled up with gum or something then the lizards began to hiss exactly the way they hiss to this day when they are frightened and the big animals inside the boat poked out their noses to see what was to pay oh they are nothing but lizards exclaimed the giraffe to the elephant who had naturally taken possession of more than his share of the only foothold in existence let them drown in the freshet but big awkward land bird with teeth and tail like church steeple took pity on the lizards and gnawed hole in the wall of the boat of course in trooped the lizards once in they disposed themselves in nooks and corners and right under the ﬂapping ears of the eleph ant and between the pointed ears of the giraffe and they began to whisper it was very low hissing whisper if they had never gotten farther than the s in the alphabet but the big animals understood plenty of room was made the lizard s and they were allowed to make square meal now and then on the ﬂies that had come in at the boat door uninvited plenty of them after few days the spring freshet came to an end and the giraffe opened the door of the and looked out he made signs to the elephant and the elephant gave the signal and out walked all the animals on dry ground which to tell the truth was rather muddy when all the other creatures were out of the boat it came the lizard turn but the elephant and the giraffe bethought them of something and turned back to the boat you promised us you promised us they cried to the wriggling lizards that had single thing about them to make anybody desire their company in land or sea so we did promise they answered hissing their words then the lizards all turned facing each other in rows and stuck out their long tongues just lizards to this day and breathed on one another and made sizzling noise suddenly from each side of their long tails appeared which grew very fast till the scales were all disappeared and then little baby feathe rs appeared on their backs and breasts and fore legs or arms which overlapped each other like scales and were beautiful and soft and beaks grew in place of the wide mouths only the hind legs were left they were but these too began to change they grew long and slim and hard but the nails remained they were before only stronger then the lizards were reptiles longer but beautiful birds and with one accord they began to sing each singing different song from his neighbor and making the clear air ring with melody and the giraffe made signs to the elephant and the elephant signaled all the other animals to return and so they returned and they could hardly believe their eyes when the elephant told them these were the crawling lizards that had come into the the last thing but he assured them they were the very same and then he told them how the lizards had promised him and the big giraffe that if they would be permitted to stay in the boat with the rest until the spring freshet was over they would be angels ever afterward and spend all their time when they were not eating and sleeping in making glad melody all the animal world while the giraffe was speaking the birds lifted their wings which an hour before were bare arms and soared out and up into the blue sky singing they went and this was the origin of the singing birds to explain how to this day there are plenty of lizards of all sizes and colors the legen d hints sequel to the story not all of the lizards were able or even willing to go into the being naturally shy and the holes the big bird pecked in the walls were all too soon sealed up 14 15 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https drowned the remaining lizards crept up on the backs of the great water dragons the leviathan and behemoth which nobody knows anything about in our days and so were saved anyhow we have them on warm days sunning themselves on and bare rocks or scurrying under the stumps and stones but they are always on good terms with the birds we have seen them basking in the sun together and they eat the selfsame insects the lizards are doubt discussing with the birds the approach of another spring freshet when they too will bethink them of the and so come by feathers and songs harmless they are the birds whom they resemble in many ways we have taught some of them to drink milk and honey from teaspoon and to peck at insects in our ﬁngers to come at our call and to lie in our hands to some they are beautiful creatures to others they are nothing but lizards boys throw stones at them and girls wish there were lizards they are so ugly oh the pity of it if these would but turn the creatures tenderly over they would see beautiful colors on the under side that sparkle and glisten like the breast of brightly tinted bird we are acquainted with one lizard long with breast silver and we love to think of the time of course it is imagination though they say there is possibly some truth in it when another spring freshet or something will turn the little reptile into the bird he resembles chapter i our comrade the robin robin sir robin knight now you have come to us summer in sight you never dream of the wonders you visions that follow the ﬂash of your wing how all the beautiful by and by around you and after you seems to ﬂy sing on or eat on pleases your mind well have you earned every morsel you ﬁnd aye ha ha ha whistles robin my dear let us all take our own choice of good cheer lucy l arcom on account of its generous distribution and the affection the bird in the heart of young america and england alike the robin shall be given ﬁrst place among the singing birds he is the little wanderer the name crusoe of almost every clime and race true he may be warbler instead of thrush in the old world but what does that signify to whatever class or family he may belong by right of birth and legend the bird of the red breast is the bird of the human breast it is impossible to study the early history of birds in any language and not stumble upon legend and superstition and the more we read of these the more we come to delight in them there may not be bit of truth in the matter but there is fascination it is like delving among the dust and cobwebs of an old attic the more dust and cobwebs the more fun in coming upon things one never went in quest of of course superstition has its objections but when the robin is the point at issue we may waive objections and go on our merry ways satisﬁed that the oldest and clearest head in the family will concur legends concerning our comrade the robin are full of tender thought of him they have kept his memory green through the rain and shine of centuries even going so far to embalm him after death will be seen it is impossible to give the earliest date in which the robin is mentioned sacred bird certain it is that he ranks with characters of ye olden time myth and superstition enshrined him the literature of many tongues has preserved him poetry and sculpture have 16 17 18 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https him and given him place among the gods and winged beings that inhabit the neighbor world did he not scorch his original gray breast by taking his daily drop of water to lost souls did he not stain it by pressing his faithful heart against the crown of thorns or did he not burn it in the far north when he fanned back into ﬂame the dying embers which the polar bear thought to have trampled out in his wrath that white men invaded his shores was he not always the pious bird it must be confessed that his beak alone seemed to be possessed of religious tendencies was he not the original church sexton who covered the dead with impartial beak from eye of sun and man piling high and dry the woodland leaves about them the wandering minstrel the orphan child or the knight of kingly robe each shared his sweet charity robin the english ballad of the babes in the wood immortalized his memory in poetical sentiment their little corpse the found and strewed with pious bills the leaves around earlier than the pathetic career of these babes homage was paid to the robins who with leaves and ﬂowers cover the friendless bodies of unburied men this superstition of the robin art in caring the dead runs through many of the old poets drayton grahame hood herrick and others strict justice in the matter would have divided the praise of him with the charitable night winds it was they more than he who covered friendless bodies the sylvan shades of the old world being then more comprehensive than now unburied men from any cause found their last in the lap of the forest sleeping wherever they fell since laws of decent burial governed the wilds the night winds true to their instincts then now swirled the fallen leaves about any object in their way in the fashion of burial shroud matter of course credit was given to the robin whose voracious appetite always led him to plunder litter of any sort in search of food up bright and early is still his habit since at this hour he is able to waylay the belated night insect the robin was spied bestirring the forest leaves and unbeknown to himself was sainted all time and his duties were not conﬁned to those of sexton alone according to good witnesses he became both sculptor and cler 19 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https when i die make both my monument and elegy they were supposed to the foliage from the trees on which

evening hours shall kindly lend his aid with hoary moss and gathered ﬂowers to deck the grave where thou art laid and again from one of the old poets who was naturally anxious that his own last rites should be proper well pathetic and while the wood nymphs my old corpse inter sing thou my dir ge chorister my epitaph in foliage next write this here the tomb of robert herrick is and so it came to pass by the patronage of the poets that in the early centuries this little bird came to be protected by an affectionate unwritten law to molest redbreast was to bring the swift vengeance of lightning on the house the ancient boy knew better if he cherished his personal safety than to steal young bird the purpose of captivity robin in cage sets all heaven in rage the sobbing sobbing of pretty pretty robin would surely call down upon the head of the luckless thief the dire displeasure of the deities runs the rhyme meant in all reverence it should also be quoted the robin and the wren are god almighty cock and hen him that harries their nest never shall his soul have rest terrible punishments were thus meted out to the ancient urchin whose instincts would lead him to rob bird nests in pilgrim progress christiana is said to have been greatly astonished at seeing robin with spider in its beak said she what disparagement it is to such little pretty bird the redbreast is he being also bird above many that loveth to maintain kind of sociableness with man i had thought they had lived on crumbs of like him worse than i and the interpreter to clinch moral lesson in the mind of the religious woman explained how the robins when they are by themselves catch and gobble up spiders they can change their diet like the ungodly hypocrite drink iniquity and swallow down sin like water and so obedient to her spiritual adviser christiana liked the robin worse than she did poor soul she should have observed herself that robin to gobble up spider is iniquity did she think that crumbs grew on bushes ready made early breakfast or that the under side of woodland leaves was buttered to order spiders the robin must have else how could he obtain the strings his harp wherever the spider spins her thread there is her devotee the robin he may not be seen to pluck and stretch the threads but the source of them he loves and he says his best grace above this dainty of his board our pet robin was known to stand patiently by the crack of door asking that it be opened wider in his opinion spider was hiding behind it he heard her stockinged tread he hears also the slippered feet of the grub in the garden the grubs have feet which it is known they can tolerably well without sure it is the world over be he thrush or warbler the robin is partial to bread and butter to bread thrice buttered if he can get it fat of any sort he craves the more practical than sentimental believe that he uses it in the preparation of the colors done in oil with which he tints 20 21 22 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https breast lack of oil therefore where it is not provided by his friends or discovered by himself his breast is underdone in color paling even to dusky hue so that would you have redbreast of deepest dye be liberal with his buttered bread and his yellow mouth ah it is the color of spring butter when the dandelions are astir oozing out it were when he is very young if suggestion to those who love him the historical wedding of cock robin to jenny wren was the result of anxiety on the part of mutual friends who would unite their favorite birds the courtship the merry marriage the picnic dinner and the rest of the trage dy are well described alas the death and burial of the who did not live to enjoy the bliss of wedded life prearranged by his solicitous friends but the affair went merry while and was good until fortunes changed all the birds of the air combined to make the event happy one and they dined and they supped in elegant style each took bumper and drank to the pair cock robin the bridegroom and jenny wren the fair just the dinner things were being removed and the bird guests were singing ﬁt to be heard mile around in stalked the cuckoo who it is presumed had not been invited to the wedding and was angry at being slighted he rudely began pulling the bride all about by her pretty clothes which aroused the temper of the groom naturally enough who could wonder his best man the sparrow went out and armed himself his weapons being the bow and arrow and took his usual steady aim to hit the intruder but like many another excited marksman he missed his aim and oh the pity of it shot cock robin himself it was an easy way the poet to dispose of the affair he knew very well robin and wren could mate in truth nor did the sparrow deny his unintentional blunder when it came to the trial there were witnesses in plenty and robin was given splendid who had himself ofﬁciated at many ceremony of the same sad sort it is pathetic tale any one may see who reads it and served the purpose of stimulating sympathy the birds we have forgiven the sparrow his blunder will be seen later on in consequence of it the birds were called up in line and made to something thus distinguishing themselves idlers the mating of robin with jenny wren proved failure of course so we have our dear twa birds the robins near alike two peas when the male is not singing and the female is not cuddling her nest triﬂe brighter of tint is the male in north america but the two combine like any staid farmer and his wife in getting living out of the soil hand in hand it were they wander about the country anywhere under the ﬂag at home wherever it rains but returning to the same locality with true homing instinct often the suggests the proper season family affairs completing these same affairs in time to look after their winter outﬁt of clothes this last more on account of their annual shabby condition than by reason of the rigors of cold they change climate often health and happiness including of course food require true some penalties attach to this sudden and frequent change but the robins accept whatever comes to them with protest of song returning good evil even when charged with stealing more fruit than the law allows it is impossible to compare the good they with any possible harm since the insect is always and the robin farming implements never grow rusty always in the wake of the robins is the hawk and many another winged enemy their migrations are followed by faithful foes who secrete themselves in the shadows we deprived one of these desperadoes of his dinner before he had so much tasted it also of his pleasure in obtaining another we brought him down in the very act and rescued his victim only by prying apart the reluctantly dying claws but whatever may be said of hawks and such other hungry beings who lay claim to vegetable diet their cruelty should be overlooked since it is impos sible to draw the lines without affecting the robin himself see with what excusable greed he snatches at winged beings which happen to light rest in their ﬂight or draws the protesting 23 24 birds of song and

and ﬂies delight in being made over into new and better loved individuals would the actually convert this redbreast from the error of his victual ways he may so by substituting cooked or raw food from his own table the robin is an apt student of civilization and adopts the ways of its reformers with relish to the statement that robins require diet of worms to insure life and growth we can say that we have raised whole family on bread and milk alone with perfect success true we allowed them bit of watermelon in melon season but they used it more newfangled bath than food actuall y rolling in it and pasting their feathers together with the sticky juice the farmer orchard is the robin own patch of ground and he revels in its varied bounties pair of them know at glance the very crotch in the which grew three prongs on purpose their nest the extreme center scooped to thimble capacity suggests the initial proper foundation the said post may be placed directly across it but that does not change the idea above is the parting of the boughs across whose inverted arches sticks alternate and so on up and atop of straws and leaves and sticks is the loving cup of clay with its soft lining of vegetable ﬁber and grasses what care the robins that little cover roofs them and their young are they not water birds by nature and wind birds well our pet sat hours at time in hot weather emersed to

than anything else in the world by the planting of the he plants thought in the breast of his little son i like mulberries father what makes you set out in an apple orchard the robins my son have you heard that luck follows the robins what is luck father luck my son is any good thing which people make themselves and the folks they think about and the little boy sits down on buttercup cushion and meditates on luck while he watches the robins knocking at the doors of the larvæ engaged in making luck other folks and the boy own luck takes the right turn all on account of his father setting out whole full of children are known to be after the same sort of luck when they plant tree on arbor day or or even an apple in due time is sure to bring forth just the crotch to delight the heart of mother robin in june not that the robins not select other places than to nest in an unusual place is quite likely to charm them let person interest himself little in the robin affairs and he will see startling results by the summer solstice an old hat in the crotch of tree an inverted sunshade or even discarded scarecrow terrible to behold left over from last year and hidden in the foliage one and all suggest possibilities to the robins mud that is fresh and sweet is essential to robin nest stale sour mud is ﬁt use sweet stuff is what they want pack of twigs made up loosely soft grass and ﬁber all delight the who are sure to select location near by they are sure to stay all summer near the farmer on account of the nearness of food anywhere from four to thirty feet one may ﬁnd the nests with little trouble they are so bulky all but the delicate inside of them which is soft down being next thing to toes of the little new people ﬁnding their ﬁrst means of clinging to life by what is next to them lining gives young robins delicious sense of safety they hold on instinct to hold on tight being about the ﬁrst in any young thing be it bird or human baby except perhaps the instinct of holding

cheerily cheerily cheer up the very same song we heard him sing within the arctic circle far up to the snow line of the jade mountains alternating his song with the eating of juniper berries but one might go on forever with the robin he hops and skips and ﬂies from the atlantic to the paciﬁc and from alaska to mexico and other parts but one would never get to the end of loving him when poor robin at last meets with disaster and can not pick himself up again in short is gone to that world where birds are blest the leaves shall remember to cover him while we imagine with the poet who thought it not time and talent wasted to write an epitaph to the redbreast small notes wake from under ground where now his tiny bones are laid prowling cat with whiskered face approaches this sequestered place

beak and turning it about in ludicrous way if laughing to himself at this annual joke of his dropping the remnant of his summer plumage he cants his wise little head and gives shrill cry of applause it ﬂoats away whatever may be said of his musical powers the mocker exceeds his fellows in the art of listening we have known him to sit the better part of an afternoon concealed in thick foliage listening with all his might to the various songs about him with full intention of repeating them at midnight and repeat them he does not forgetting the postman whistle nor the young turkeys just learning to run in the wet grass to an untimely grave he has an agreeable way of improving upon the original of any song he imitate s so that he is supposed to give free music lessons to all the other birds his own notes belonging solely to himself are beautiful and varied and he sandwiches them in between the rest in way to suit the best we imagine that he forgets from year to year and must have his memory stirred occasionally this is particularly so in his imitation of the notes of young birds we never hear them early in spring or very late in autumn after he has completed his silent molt in late summer however when the baby birds have grown into juveniles then old man mocker takes up his business of mimicking the voices of the late nursery american mocking bird until we knew his methods we would start at peculiar sounds in the garden and cry to one another there late brood of young ones and run to locate the tardy family from his perch on the chimney the mocker laughs at us while he squeals like his own little son of month old or coaxes like whole nestful of baby linnets matter who is the victim of his mimicry he loves the corner of chimney better than any other perch and carols

then suddenly the whole is repeated through graphophone and we listen and laugh well we know that the only source of it all is our dear mocker how he gets the graphophone ring we not know any more than we know how he comes by all his powers of reproduction of practice he has plenty and his industry in this respect may be the key to his success the male differs so slightly from his mate that the two are indistinguishable save at they pair in early spring and are faithf ully united in all their duties they nest mostly in bushes or low branches from four to twenty feet from the ground the nests are large and often in plain sight like the robin and other thrushes the mocker ﬁrst thought is the foundation this is made of large sticks and grasses interlaced and crossed loosely upon these the nest proper is placed of soft materials lined with horsehair or grasses with the mockers with other birds there is not ﬁxed rule to nesting materials outside of few fundamental principles to foundations they select the material at hand where cotton is to be obtained they use it and strings in place of grass leaves in the foundation are bulky and little trouble to gather we have found pair of mockers very sly and silent just at or the female will be at the nest work while her mate is singing at distance if to distract us from the scene of action however in our grounds where we have taught all birds extreme conﬁdence the good work progresses in plain sight one writer has declared that pair of mockers will desert nest if you so much look at it this is true only where they are very wild and unaccustomed to human friends when once the young are hatched the fun begins during the day the male ceases to sing and devotes himself to giving exact information to where the nest may be found of course this information is unintentional he ﬂies at us if we step out in sight screaming with all his might the nearer we approach the nest the louder and nearer he cries until he actually has an attack of hysterics and turns somersaults in the air or quivers in the foliage if it be possible to reach you from behind he dives at your shoulder and nips at your hair always from behind never facing you his quiet mate ﬂits through the boughs if she understands her husband exaggerated solicitude and half smiles to see his performances in day or two the young birds are able to speak themselves and from this on until the next brood of their parents is hatched the youngsters keep up coaxing squeal getting out of the nest in about two weeks they ﬂy awkwardly about easy prey to cats and other thieves from nest of four or ﬁve eggs pair of mockers well if they raise two or even one night birds ﬁnd them easy to steal they sleep on the ground or under bush at ﬁrst being several days in learning to ﬂy and much longer time in learning to eat by themselves this year three sets of young mockers were raised on raspberries they were brought to the patch soon they left the nest where they remained on the ground along the drooping canes the old birds kept with them putting in all their time at teaching the awkward things the art of helping themselves the parent bird would hop up foot or two seize tip end of twig on which was the usual group of berries and bring it down to the ground holding it there and bidding the young ones take bite not bite would they take squealing with

like many another voluble being his bark is worse than his bite not his weapon but his word is law so fraternal are the mockers we see them that the close coming of them near the house in spring insures us the company of many other birds it is hard to outwit the mockers they love fruit of any sort well they love insects they dote on scarecrows those guardian angels of domestic birds and have

in perfect conﬁdence the ﬁrst of the season we saw only the male and he kept high in the trees ﬁfty or sixty feet or more above ground singing soon everybody was out of sight but disappearing if door opened we thought him belated robin so the songs of the two birds impress stranger weeks we could catch not so much glimpse of the singer though we hid in the shrubbery shrubbery was barrier to the sight of the keen little eye and ear above then we took to the attic and from little roof corner beheld the musician but his song was short and ended unﬁnished so suspicious was the bird gradually he came to understand that disturbed the garden stillness even though he sat on an outer bough and cat lurked in the roses he also appeared to notice that nobody played ball on the greensward nor threw stones at stray chickens altogether circumstances seemed favorable to sir grosbeak and he brought madam along down from the mountain cañons by midsummer of the second season the two were seen at sunrise low the tallest of the but they ﬂew higher or disappeared if the door were opened it was the year that we ﬁrst planted the row of logan berries new cross between the blackberry and raspberry it was between the orange and lemon trees in quiet corner of the orchard and the grosbeaks espied them reddening month before they ripened by getting up at dawn we made sure that nesting operations had begun within twenty feet of the logan berries but which way it was not until the eggs were laid that we found the site on low limb of adjoining the berry row the nest was made solely of dry spines and so transparently laid that we could distinguish the three eggs from below there was lining plenty of ventilation in this and other of these grosbeaks nests observed in the foothill s being the rule perhaps the climate induces the birds to this sanitary measure certain it is that this nest could be harbor those insect foes that too often make life miserable the birdlings the summer passed

nor bit of mud or paste the beak of the orioles differs so widely from that of the grosbeaks that one has but to compare them to be interested one might almost imagine the bill of grosbeak to be cup

year new clothes whether on birds or people fade with wear and sunshine and lose the luster of newness everybody knows the oriole you ca make mistake that is you know the male you may not be so certain of the female and young these are always duller of color more olive and without the bright black of the male moreover the young male orioles dress very much like their sisters until they are year or two old when they dress like lord neighbor of ours was sure she had discovered new species hanging their nest under the awning of window both birds were dull yellow exactly similar in size and

oriole attaches its nest or hammock to twigs pretty well up out of reach and weaves the same of grasses and string or horsehairs or all combined some of the strings and hairs are very long and are passed back and forth in fabric fashion and really very beautiful the cradles swing with every passing breeze suggesting the origin of the indian lullaby song baby in the treetop the eggs are four or ﬁve in number bluish white with many and various markings in brown these are laid on soft bed of wool or other suitable material wind can blow the young from the nest though sorry accidents sometimes

is the bullock oriole which was also named an english gentleman who discovered the gay fellow up in tree laughing at him there is less black on the head and neck of the bullock than on the baltimore but the two relatives are alike in habits and manners the hooded oriole differs from both the others in the fact that he wears hood or cowl of yellow falling over the face like mask perhaps the bill is more slender and decurved than in the bullock the orchard oriole differs from the others in lacking the bright orange or yellow with the black of his dress his bright chestnut breast however with the pointed bill and familiar manners distinguish him member of the family the nest is more compact than that of the others woven sometimes of green grasses which mature into hay retaining the green tint which helps to hide its exact location in the foliage where it is placed to know one member of the oriole family is to know them all in sense and to know them is to love them here in southern

on to last year like sewing the two together with threads three pairs of these nests are swinging from single feet above the driveway often pair of orioles will suspend their hammocks under the cloth awnings of windows if provision is made them strong string or little rope put in and out of the cloth close up under the corner will tempt them we have not known an oriole to pierce ﬁrm untransparent texture of any sort with her needle beak on this account we tempt her with the rope if corn leaves were high enough the orioles would doubtless take them in their season not so very different from

and tattered nesting site and resort to the trees any tree will answer but favorite is the whose extreme height offers inducements though why the birds should take height into consid eration we not know later when the leaves have matured they select low banana stock with its broad leaf so low the hand can reach it it may be they learn conﬁdence the season advances we have seen nests with us made of other material than the light yellow ﬁber which the birds strip from the edge of the eaves the identical leaf of which the big broad fans are made when the leaf is green it drips small threads from the edges of its midribs which you see in the fan thick grooves these threads the orioles may be seen pulling out or off any hour in the day if the nest be located in tree if they have found suitable banana leaf they work only in the morning and evening the leaf folds up like book in the daytime and the sharp apex under which the nest cuddles is difﬁcult to reach an oriole works only from below pushing the thread up and pulling it down the width of two or three veins away from the ﬁrst stitch making good hold she ﬁrst leaves dozen or twenty threads swinging after doubling her stitches to

swinging and on the whole is an ideal nursery the adaptation of the oriole feet clinging and perching is good thought of nature else the bird could never weave from below she does she sticks her sharp toes through the mesh of the leaf clinging to rib while she works this custom of beginning on the inside of the nest marks the building instincts of all the birds should they reverse the order they would make mere tangle without inside proportions it would be impossible to weave from without the nest progresses the outer threads are coarser and less closely woven brought togethe r at certain points of attachment to the twig or the leaf rib and making nest the winds might play with but not steal away the oriole nest is the poetry of bird architecture be it swung in an or an elm or maple or

tiny throat of the baby and into the depths of its pudgy being this food which was moist and smooth was very nourishing indeed and sweet well it tasted good and left such relish in the mouth that said mouth always opened of itself when the mother bird came near but more than its own share of the victuals did dicky get though he did his very best to have it all there were other babies in the same cradle to be looked after and fed and they all ﬁve were much alike ﬁve peas excepting that dicky was the smallest of all and was kept pushed well down in the bottom of the nest this did not prevent his mother from noticing his open mouth when it came his turn to be fed canary mothers have sharp eyes so have canary fathers will be seen now when this particular pair of birds began to look about the cage good place to ﬁx upon family affairs some kind hand from outside fastened little round basket in one corner exactly of the right sort to stimulate nesting business it was an basket with work sides and bottom airy and clean now had this basket been box instead we should have had tragedy to record or had the mesh been closely woven fatal mistake though well meant would have darkened the sky of this domestic affair but alas the truth must be told since the biography we are writing admits of reservations it all came about by the interference of the father bird whose presence in the nursery should have been forbidden at the start the mother was more than once alarmed by his activity and misapplied zeal about the nest and she had scolded him away with emphatic tones 62 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https not having anything of importance to save to eat all day and sleep all night he was on the alert employment one dreadful morning when the mother was attending to breakfast this father canary espied some tatters sticking out of the bottom meshes of the nest basket bits of string ends and threads carelessly and innocently overlooked ah thought he here is something that ought to be attended to at once and he went to work he thrust his sharp beak up between the round meshes of the basket bottom and pulled at every thread he could lay hold of struggling beneath fairly losing his foothold in his eagerness to pull them out having succeeded in dragging most of the material from beneath the birdlings he caught sight of few more straight pink strings lying across the meshes and began tugging at them the mother feeding the babies from the edge of the nest above noticed the little ones each in its turn crouching farther and farther into the bottom of the cradle faintly opening their mouths if to cry but being too young and weak to utter sound it was mystery but the deepest mystery of it all was the fact that little dicky the dwarf of the family came to the top the rest worked down and was getting more than his share of the breakfast about this time the mistress of the came to see after her pets and beheld sight which made her scream hard if she had seen mouse there beneath the nest was the father bird tugging at protruding feet and legs of baby birds with all his might growing more and more excited he saw his supposed strings resisting his attempts to pull them through when the affair was looked into there was but one bird left alive of the ﬁve little infants more than ﬁve days old and they were released from their predicament to have decent burial in the garden at the foot of cabbage head that stood straight up in disgust of the cruel affair if she would ever have such thing happen to her little cabbages true she had little cabbages of her own but that made dif ference now that we have tucked away these four little who never saw the light of day and therefore never could realize what they missed by not holding on harder to what little they had by way of feet and legs we will drop the painful subject and attend to dicky of course the father bird was excluded from the nursery he should have been weeks before and there was only one mouth to feed and that mouth was never empty unless the owner of it was sleeping in fact the babe was stuffed though strange to say his stomach grew bigger but less and less the rest of his body ﬁlled out 63 64 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https the end of couple of weeks he had pretty fair shirt on his back of delicate down softer than any shirt of wool that ever warmed human baby body and the mother stood on the edge of the basket and admired it she did make it of course but she was in some way responsible it and doubt felt proud of the bit of fancy work she noticed also that the eyes of the little one did not bulge so much they did and tiny slit appeared at the center widening slowly until one happy hour they opened fairly out and the baby had eyes but they were tired eyes to start with like the eyes of most young things and they wearied with just glimpse of the light so the lids closed and it was several days before dicky actually took in the situation he ought there being other baby to crowd he kept to the nest longer than birds commonly and when at last he got on his feet he was pretty well ﬂedged now when he had obtained his ﬁrst youthful suit of clothes his mother looked surprised did also his father it is to be supposed he in his solitary cage hanging close to the other both parent birds were tenerif fe canaries the male green emerald and the female more dusky and lighter by strange freak of nature which happens sometimes by breeding these birds in captivity the young fellow was bright yellow of the tint of ripe lemon beak white and eye black while his feet and ankles retained their original baby pinkness oh he was pretty bird but it was foreordained in his case in similar cases that he should not be so sweet singer though his color had been like that of his parents he was not conscious of this fact however and it mattered not to him that he was yellow instead of green nor did he care in the least that the price of him was marked down to dollar and half when it should have been double away he went in new cage after his new mistress had paid the sum named into the hand of his former owner he peeked out of the bars he was carried along swinging at every step that is he peeped out well he could consider ing that cloth was covered over the cage the wind blew the cloth aside now and then and dicky saw wonderful that were familiar and so not that he in his own short life had ever seen such sights but that somehow in his little being were vague memories or conceptions of what his ancestors had seen it is hard to explain it but everything can not be explained when we come to one of these things we call it instinct with wise shake of our head s just we were told to say jerusalem when we came to word we could pronounce when we were very young and read in the second reader well dicky had good home of his own and lived purpose although he never developed into trained singer in the heart of him he longed mate and often expressed his desires in low musical notes but mate came to him and he would sit hours pondering on his bachelor lot and singing more notes now wild birds are constantly having something happen to them they ﬂy against wire or get wing hurt or the young fall out of the nest and ca ﬁnd their mother dicky mistress was always on the lookout such accidents and she brought such birds into the house and nursed them and brought them back to health when possible it occurred to her to offer calling or vocation to dicky so she made small private hospital of his cage into which she placed the victims of accident or sickness she found them dicky was surprised never having seen bird save his parents and his in his dreams and at ﬁrst he stood on tiptoe and was frightened but he learned to be kind after while and to show his visitors where the food and water were kept and to snuggle up to them on the perch when it came bedtime many and many poor invalid did he aid in restoring to freedom and ﬂight until he became pretty well acquainted with the birds that nest in our grounds year after year the good work went on and dicky developed more musical talent until he sang sweetly imitating the ﬁnches and linnets outside in the fall of the year when the wild birds were thinking of their annual migrations dicky himself grew restless and quit his songs then his mistress opened his door and told him he might go not far away of course but all about in the room that seemed to this caged bird big any world could be in his quest new nooks he came by accident upon the mirror above the ﬁreplace standing on the edge of little vase before the glass just in front of the beveled edge of it he espied two yellow birds one in the glass itself and another in the beveled edge strict law of science had determined should be the case in second the whole bearing of the bird was changed his feathers lay close his legs stood long and slim and his eyes bulged they never had bulged since the lids parted when he was two weeks old then he found voice he sang never green bird sang sweeter he turned his head and the two birds in the glass turned their heads he preened his wing and the two birds preened each wing his little throat swelled out in melody the tip of his beak pointing straight to the ceiling of the big room if it were indeed the blue sky and the two birds sang with uplifted 65 66 67 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https and swelling throats they were of his own kind his own race his own ancestral comrades and they were not green the low mesas of the canary islands never resounded to such melody but melody was not food at least so thought dicky mistress she tempted the bird in vain to eat not crumb would he touch until placed back in his cage where he straightway forgot his recent discoveries usual he took his bread and cooky to the water and set it to soak dinner and scattered his seeds about the cage ﬂoor in his eagerness to dispose of the essentials the hemp only being in his opinion suitable his needs of course he was obliged to pick up his crumbs after he had thus assorted the varieties every day when the door was open he ﬂew straight to the mirror if we moved the vase to the middle away from the beveled edge he found the place by himself and stood on tiptoe exactly where the reﬂection accorded him the companionship of two birds and he would resume his melody it was real to him this comradeship and it lasted until actual and personally responsible companions were provided him now let not the reader conjure up picture of many birds in cage with dicky governor or presiding elder it was midsummer when the sands are hot and inviting to the retiring and modest family known by name lizards the particular branch of this family to which we refer and to which dicky was referred is known to scientists who would be precise of expression gerrhonotus but the familiar name of lizard is sufﬁcient the creatures we placed in large wire cage on the upper balcony and designed dicky summer companions now it should not seem strange to any one that we chose the lizard people to associate with this canary were they not one and the same long ages ago and this is legend but fact have they not both to this day scales on their legs and good long backbone to be sure the birds now have feathers on most of their bodies so they may be able to ﬂy but long while ago the bird had only scales and not single feather and are not baby lizards hatched from eggs laid by the mother lizard ah it is long story this dating back too far to count but long stories are quite the accepted fashion in natural science and from reading them we resolved to make some observations of our own there is more to be gained sometimes in making observations on one own account than by adopting those of others we captured half dozen lizards and gave them the names of lizbeth liza liz and lize that is four of them being of the same order received these names there were two little ones besides with trimmings which have nothing to with this story the four named were about eight inches in length speckled above and silver beneath their other beauties and characteristics will not be discussed except it becomes necessary in treating of dicky further development from the day when these ﬁve creatures became they were friend the lizards took to sleeping in the canary so that in getting at his meals he was obliged to peck between them and sometimes to step over them and crowd them with his head after hidden seeds the afternoon sunshine slanted across the cage the ﬁve took their dry bath all in heap bird on top with wings outspread lizards in tangle each and all thankful that there was such thing sun bath or family descent later the sun was going down and the lizards became drowsy lizards will dicky sang them low lullaby now on the perch above them now on the rim of the at times another comrade joined them especially at this choral hour one of those red and white striped snakes seen in ferns and brakes along watercourses made home in the cage with the bird and the lizards this snake had an ear music at the ﬁrst notes he emer ged from his lair slowly and cautiously lifted his graceful head toward the singer and glided in his direction if the bird were on the perch the snake would crawl up the end posts taking hold with his scales which of course were his feet and lie at length on the perch at dicky feet watching out of its beautiful eyes at other times it would merely glide toward the bird lift its head erect some ﬁve or six inches and remain motionless until the song was ﬁnished big warty also an inmate of this asylum was friend of dicky indeed was every creature even to the big grasshopper this toad and the bird were often seen in the bath together the toad simply squatting is the custom of toads the bird splashing and spattering the water over everything including of course the toad the toad blinked and squatted ﬂatter to the bottom of the bath hopping out when the bird was done and the two sunning themselves after nature own way of using it would be too long story were one to tell of the songs dicky sang to the drone of the drones bumming away against the wire sorry perhaps that they were to become dinner to lizards before summer was half over but we must bring the biography to an end hoping that these few 68 69 70 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https will tend to interest people in the dickies that are about them in wire cages too often neglected and never half comprehended but we should by all means give an account of the last we ever saw of this particular dicky during his stay on the balcony he had become acquainted with the ﬁnches and linnets and of the yard holding quiet talks with them in the twilight and growing more thoughtful at times even to the extent of watching opportunities to escape one evening just we lifted the door to set in fresh pan of water out darted dicky straight to tree near by he ﬂew and called himself over and over again we cried to him dicky dicky come back ah but here was taste of freedom which his ancestral relatives had enjoyed on the low slopes of tenerif fe before ever foreign ship had carried them away captive and dicky had never read word about his ancestors and their freedom therefore what did he know about it scientists call it instinct it is word too hard us and we will say jerusalem and let it pass away across the street ﬂew dicky the bird of prison birth the bird of only two comrades of his kind and color and these but shadows in mirror the lizards heard us call and

recognize the fact that birds are their comrades and friends to be cherished and fed not always hunted and eaten on account of the distribution of sparrows the world over many legends have been written of them the very earliest we have read is the one that assures us the sparrow was seen by mother eve in the garden of eden on the day she ate of the forbidden fruit in fact the tree was full of sparrows warning the woman not to eat though the birds themselves were making the fruit with might and main in the story of joseph it is recorded that the chief baker had dream in his dream he bore three baskets on his head in the uppermost basket were all kinds of the king while the baker was walking to the palace with the baskets on his head the sparrows came and ate all the meat there was in the upper basket in the narrative the name of the birds is not given but the fact that they ate up the meat going in at the little wickerwork spaces leads us to believe they were sparrows it was only

thrifty and took to spreading it everywhere she thought she had enough to make the whole world yellow this being her favorite color but she soon collected her wits and reasoned that if everything were yellow there would be nothing left contrast so she quit spreading it on and took to tossing it about in great glee not caring where it went so it was in dashes and dots and streaks and lumps here and there she threw whole handfuls on the ﬂowers and butterﬂies and little worms and toadstools and grass roots and up in the sky at sunset and against mountain peaks the mountains laughed at this sudden whim of mother nature opening their mouths wide and got whole apronfuls tossed right down their throats after the ocean bottoms had been peppered with the gold the ﬂowers came along their share the buttercups and dandelions and goldenrod and sunﬂowers and jonquils and hosts of 82 83 84 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https last came the orioles and ﬁnches and bobolinks and many others each in turn getting spray or dash or grain of the yellow and went away singing about it but certain very plain little birds arrived later when the gold was almost gone

gold we will follow them about like shadows and look well to the nesting then nature smiled on the unselﬁsh lady birds and tossed all she had left of the yellow stuff straight at the singers who stood before her each behind the other in straight row thinking she would give it to them in bits but nature threw it at them with all her might laughing of course the bird in front got the biggest splash and then it scattered down the line until the last few had only dust or two but they all began to warble every one each so happy that he had little gold when nature saw that the bird in the front had more than his share she looked very keenly in his face and said my son you must go everywhere all over the cities and towns and country and forests wherever human hearts are sad and eyes are dim with tears and you must warble all about summer and good times when the clouds are dark and you must be fond of houses where people dwell and ﬁelds and playground s and sheep and keep company with sorrow and make the earth glad you had so much gold about you and you can stay out in the rain and make believe the sun shines when it does just to make people happier shoo little summer yellowbird that is your name and the bird has been true to his happy mission ever since going about here and there and everywhere in our country taking his gold with him and making buttercups and dandelions grow on and goldenrod quiver in the glens before even the spring crocuses are out in the green of the trees he looks like single nugget and when he runs up and down branch it seems if somebody had spilled liquid gold above and it was running zigzag in and out of the bark when he ﬂies in the blue sky he seems like visible laugh nobody can see the dash he makes and not smile many breaking heart has been made less sad by the sight of him and though he is not much of singer singing goes the few notes he has are cheery better to speak few glad words than be an orator and scold and the yellow summer bird could scold if he tried the more he warbles gladness the more the habit grows in those nooks where the yellow warbler does his dress act or molts the children catch the feathers they fall from his night perch or lie in the ferns and toss them about fun to see them glint in the sunshine little girls gather them doll hats and make startling fashions winter all right little girls take the feathers they are tossed to you by the merry warbler without single twinge of conscience they are yours because they are given you you did steal them nor hire big boy to bring them to you should the yellow warbler molt pair of wings by mistake and you found them lying in bush some bright autumn morning you might have them your doll hat you might even put them on your own little head but to rob bird of its gold to tear out wing or feather to ﬂaunt on your own pitiless head or the cracked china head of your would be dif ferent thing there is story aﬂoat which we are tempted to tell though it is very happy one and is not believed by everybody it especially concerns girls and some women it has been fact centuries that birds hold conventions the supposed purpose of talking over matters that concern themselves not long ago some time in the century that has just passed there was general convention of american birds held in the backwoods of the north there were representatives from all the bird families that wear bright feathers the purpose of the assembly was discussion of different points in fashion more particularly of the of women now at this point in the story everybody knows exactly the drift of the moral which is sure to come at the end the yellowbird is sure to come with the daffodils so it of use to go on with the story since the moral is what usually aim at from start to ﬁnish listen to the summer yellowbird all next season and when he gives the word let everybody big and little who loves to wear bird feathers and wings make scramble the backwoods and you may 85 86 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https the upshot of the convention yourself in the mean time should crows and magpies and eagles and vultures and other birds of strong beak and furious temper steal down on homes and peck off the scalps of girls and women they lie in their happy beds let one be alarmed possibly there has been bird convention and the big birds of sharp claw and strong beak are but doing they are it is the fashion them to it so they are quite excusable summer yellow bird but if we go on with legends and imagined bird conventions we shall never get to the bird itself the bird itself is the summer yellowbird the dear delightful yellow warble r whose very picture you see before you the restless bird the bird who may not look exactly like himself when his coat is worn and tumbled but who comes by new fresh one when it is most sorely needed more dull of color is his mate who is just behind himself somewhere in the tree out of range of the camera the two are never far apart in family times where one ﬂies there goes the other happy clams ever are very happy which we doubt they deep down in the wet sand and never seeing ﬂower or ripe peach or raspberry all their lives however it is supposed the clam knows something akin to happiness he is always where he wants to be save when he falls into the pot and here is where we will leave him well the yellow warbler is at home all over north america migrating from place to place sometimes in twos and threes sometimes in ﬂocks at times journeying straight on and again stopping in every

when we see the warbler just we know winter is here by the ﬁrst snowﬂake and soon they arrive nesting begins that very purpose they come of course to the nests they are very beautiful the one in the picture must have been built deep in the woods where grasses and dried leaf tatters were plenty but there is set pattern to go by when nests are made that is there is particular building material allowed with the swallows and some others the yellow warbler loves best to use things that mat together readily so the nest cup will be compact and thick like piece of felt dif ferent from the nest of the grosbeak transparent and open like basketwork to get this substance the birds visit the stalks of the pasture sides pulling off the woolly furze bit by bit until beakful is gathered then they make trip to the brooks especially in early spring wher they wake up the catkins on the and get loads of the soft fur oh the secrets the know about bird and bat and butterﬂy cocoon and other winged people that frolic in their shadows they could tell you exactly how many beakfuls of pussy fur it takes to weave crib blanket yellow warbler nest whole nests are made of it sometimes the warbler loves to gather one particular kind of material nest if sh comes across enough of it in one spot that is why they build so rapidly always getting it done in hurry they love big loads of anything and the male shows his mate where she can ﬁnd it with the least trouble in places where sheep pasture rubbing against trees and catching their sides into thorns and sticks at every turn the yellowbird gathers the wool she likes this particularly it is light and clings to itself and she can carry lar ge quantities at one trip the happy boy or girl who has pasture near by home is rich there is nothing like pasture to study nature in especially birds wood lot with trees of all sizes in it cranberry bog huckleberry patch maple grove corner with snake vines running at random among young this is the spot of all the world and birds one can part the bushes and ﬁnd warbler nest most anywhere one can peer up into the treetops and ﬁnd another in the treetops the nest is fastened securely be it where the winds have habit of blowing through their ﬁngers when it is necessary but birds and winds are fair and seldom interfere with one another here in southern california we have little wind if any in the days of the summer yellowbird so nests are often set in crotch without bit of fastening two years ago pair came to the house grounds the ﬁrst we had seen so near we wondered what they would nest with ﬁrst knowing their disposition to take the material close at hand we knew they strip the down from the backs of the sycamores in the mountain cañons and gather bits of wool ﬁber from tree trunks or ravel lint from late weed stems in the arroyos so we anticipated and shook loose in bush sooner did father yellowbird spy the ﬂuffy white stuff than he brought madam and she was delighted this cotton could be pulled by beakfuls and an afternoon or two would make the entire nest and they used it not getting another thing save some gray hairs from lady head which in combing had escaped and were saved on purpose the birds the nest was placed in the crotch of pepper just out of reach of tiptoe inquirers just one pinch of cotton above another until the cup was deep and true to the shaping of the mother breast she turning round and round after the manner of through the layers ran separate hairs which held the cotton in shape it was beautiful thing that nest even after it had served its purpose and we took it down when the birds had ﬂown that was mistake of ours it was before we had come to know it is better to leave old nests undisturbed many birds love to return the coming season and repair last year structures when the following summer came and the yellowbirds returned from their winter in mexico they went straight to the same old tree they crept up and down the trunk peering into all the crotches and criticising every place where nest might have been perhaps single speck of the cotton had and served pointer anyway the birds located the exact spot and went to work without more ado exactly though they remembered they went also to the supply counter where we had placed more cotton in advance of their coming and with it they built exactly the same white nest 88 89 90 birds of song

the branches this running up and down the boughs so like their cousins the creepers makes this bird look graceful of form and motion indeed he is anywhere and at anything he does on this account he is often called the his brilliant grace suggesting some precious and coveted stone these warblers of ours did not feign lameness if we came near the nest some of the family are said to from daily companionship they came to know and trust us had the nest been little lower we should have succeeded in taming them completely we have many of the wild birds at we have left the nest where it is this fall hoping the birds will return and claim it another year it being of cotton however and having threads to bind it in the crotch we think the winter storms will wreck it it has been claimed by good authority that the loves to deposit her eggs in the yellow warbler nest but this is of little avail to the trick madam warbler sees the point and the egg at glance she often builds above the intruder

of travelers come in advance of the females and young if to see that the country is ready and at peace nothing can be said of them more beautiful and ﬁtting than this quotation from elliott coues with tireless industry the warblers defend the human race they visit the orchard when the apple and pear the peach plum and cherry are in bloom seeming to revel among the scented blossoms but never

this wise when the storm had spent itself the bluebird was the ﬁrst to go out of the boat straight toward heaven singing he went when he got to the blue sky he stopped not but pushed his way straight

the scarlet geraniums and hibiscus we not look the fragrance that distinguishes the pale violet or wild rose it is if the bright tint of bird or blossom is sufﬁcient of itself and nature would not

their nest in the grass and that the baby larks get about on the ground long before they are able to ﬂy but we are leaving the old man sitting too long on that damp log he may catch cold of one thing we are certain he will catch sight of that rogue lark if he waits half an hour he used to wait just that way when he was boy though to keep still half long in any other place any other purpose would have been physical impossibility his specs are on the end of his nose now the old man has good far sight and he squints knowingly at bunch of three rods away who says the eye of the aged grows dim the eye of this particu lar old man never 109 110 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https brighter even when he climbed that identical elm and came near losing his balance reaching after the orchard oriole nest that swung empty just at tantalizing distance what did the boy want of that nest he just wanted to get it that was all and what does the old man want of the caroling at the base of somewhere ahead of him why he just wants his nest that is all suddenly up pops the bird right out of the waving mound he was sure to be in and he ﬂies low to the nearest stone heap looking the old man right in the eyes if he had easy conscience ever reposed in the breast of man or bird and other conscience has the to be sure it is the same conscience that has descended to him through his ancient family down through countless generations but the old man is after the conscience of the dear bird he is after what may develop at the base of that grassy mound over toward it he goes feeling with his cane poking the buttercups and smartweed and yarrow aside ha he laughs i got it mary mary is anywhere in sight but the old man habit of telling mary everyt hing stands by him like any good friend he has been telling her everything all his life and why should he tell her about this lark nest the very latest discovery of his deceiving this old boy all these bent low and forming rather awkward archway over possible corridor hold secrets out darts the mother lark with many sign of maternal anxiety and the singer discontinues his morning carol the old man kneels very stifﬂy down in the meadow he thinks he is dropping down with jerk in boy fashion and parts the grasse he peers in and sees something he laughs parting his gums wide exhibiting to black and yellow bumblebee solitary tooth like the last remaining picket on the garden gate he swung on when he was boy then he rises stifﬂy and goes fast his legs can carry him exactly he has always done years more or less straight to tell mary just he reaches the doorstep and places his strong cane against the corner preparatory to lifting his right foot he turns to take look at the spot he has just left in the meadow he shades his eye from the sun and sees crouching form bigger than was his own at the age of ten he tries to shout but that one tooth standing in the door of his lips like faithful sentinel or something back of and behind it in the years that are gone prevents his voice from reaching farther than the stone wall at the garden edge mary inside darning knit stockings hears the voice that is dear to her lo these many years and she does the shouting somehow her voice is the stronger of the two get out of that meadow boy stealing lark eggs in here the boy slinks back down to the road fence and bethinks him of another meadow out of sight of folks where end of larks are singing when the is maybe there were couple of larks will club together on picnic excursion and wander off and on nobody knows just where perchance they will turn up in the next town or the next county or the next state they wander they will sing plaintively stopping meals where meals are served or they will chatter all together recognized wherever their happy lot is cast loved by the loving perhaps eaten by the sensual it will be remembered that the lark was wedding guest of ordinary ofﬁce at the marriage of cock robin and jenny wren at the very last feature of the beautiful ceremony the ballad runs this wise then on her ﬁnger fair cock robin put the ring while the lark aloud did sing be the bridegroom and happy be the bride and may not man nor bird nor beast this happy pair divide after the cruel blunder was done which was the fault of neither bird nor beast nor man by intention and the question to who should act the part of clerk at the last sad burial rites was raised it was the lark who volunteered though it is to be supposed that his heart was breaking who will be the clerk i said the lark 111 112 113 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https it not in the dark and i will be the clerk now why the lark should object to doing this very solemn service his dead friend the robin if it should happen to be dark we can not tell perchance he really could act the part of clerk at night on account of his family having been forbidden centuries and centuries ago to lean any more against the moon in the ﬁrst quarter it used to be habit of theirs to sing that way and that is how they came by the crescent on their breast the gods made up their minds that if all the larks in the world took to leaning their breasts against the moon all at one time it would result in toppling the old moon over the being the last of the family of larks to obey the command ﬂew away with the shadow of the crescent under his throat anybody can see it himself in plain sight so intimated the lark at the funeral remembering that he could have moon to lean against refused to the part asked of him if the ceremony occurred after dark though come to think of it this legen d about the crescent must be of very recent date the lark of the ballad could have been other than the english skylark which has crescent but the moon has crescent and so has our and so if there be grain of truth in the ballad and the legend our dear singer must have been spirited across the sea that special occasion our interest in this old ballad of cock robin would have died before it began had we not been informed of the whole af fair with such precision to details the beneﬁt of those who doubt the event having ever occurred within the memory of man and birds we will refer our readers to the inscription on certain very old in aldermary churchyard england if they not ﬁnd single reference to cock robin and the lark which acted the part of clerk at the funeral it will be because they have left their specs at home is is not fact that tombstones tell falsehoods thinking all these things very calmly over it occurs to us that after all any other of the singing birds we have mentioned in this book might be well ﬁtted to act the part allotted to the lark that bird himself the plain everyday facts are it was poet who reported the affair and he was at his wit end to ﬁnd word to rhyme with clerk and clerk he must have at funeral of that date now the english tongue wherever it is spoken is curious langua ge it seems ready made to suit any ﬁgure stout or slim big or little the poet knew that any person of good sense accustomed to rhyming would read the word clerk to sound like dark hence the immortal rhyme i said the lark it be not in the dark and i will be clerk chapter xiii skylark horned lark under the who loves to lie with and tune his merry

sing this song it probably caused his companion jaques to remember the skylark of his own boyhood he besought amiens to sing it again but amiens argued with his friend that it would make him melancholy however he sang again and it is supposed that the two lived over the days of their boyhood when they lay on the grass under the just on the edge of and listened to the skylark tuning his merry note in his own sweet throat 114 115 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https to the heart of english boys and other people is the skylark on account of which and the reason that britishers of any age may like to meet an old friend should they chance to take up this book in their travels we are giving chapter to this bird in the play jaques and amiens sing later together all about their favorite lark it is presumed who loves to live i the sun seeking the food he eats and pleased with what he gets surely the skylark loves to live i the sun he is always in the open summer and winter if he would be sure to not miss single sunbeam is the case with most of our birds who dwell or nest near our homes the skylark does not seek man his own sweet sake but the sake of what the farm holds though marauder is this lark it eats ground insects nearly the whole and beetles and grubs and worms and little folk who see further than their noses to be sure in late fall after the farmer and other grains are ripened and mostly harvested the larks visit the ﬁelds in ﬂocks to gather up the crumbs and grow fat on the change from meat to vegetable diet this growing fat by reason of his generous diet in late fall just before the snow s come serves the same purpose does the fattening of bear just before winter the snow covers lark meat victuals all up and the birds must fall back at times on their stores laid by under their skin this very season though they not hibernate they still have use their fat so has the gunner and the people with snares ready to set the unwary and hungry birds recent writer commenting on this autumn sport of the englishman excuses their seemingly wanton destruction by observing that were they not thus taken large numbers would doubtless meet natural death in their autumn ﬂights to quote shakespeare again often times excusing of fault doth make the fault the worse there seems to be sort of inconsistency in the fact that from earliest times the human family have been guilty of eating what most they what most they declare they love the ﬂavor of the ﬂesh of bobolink or skylark is hardly out of the mouth before the tongue takes to praising the favorite bird with psalm or hymn in due time the poet and singer bethinks him of his annual feast of ﬂesh and his spiritual appreciation grows thin horned lark 116 birds

may read in its varying notes all sorts of fortunes to people and clans and the eggs of the skylark were they not speckled and streaked by passing night winds in the shape of fairies with garden gourds ﬁlled with the ink juice of the deadly berries were the skylark eggs white they would be and the hatchlings would sing the song of the in spite of the speckled eggs and the usual grassy cover of the nest these are too often the successful object of the prowling boy though it must be confessed that in this in the case of the robbery of other birds it is not always the original ﬁnder of the nest who is guilty of theft shakespeare was aware of this fact in much ado about nothing he makes benedick speak of the ﬂat transgression of who being overjoyed with ﬁnding bird nest shows it his companion and he steals it the mistake was in showing it his companion though should the companion happen to be girl he need have fear the nest will be undisturbed next time he visits the spot eight months of the english year does the skylark sing prodding the lazy comforting the sorrowful accusing the guilty making more merry the glad on account of its upward ﬂight the bird is believed to hold

to its home in winter when the skylarks cover the sandy plains of great britain they have but single cry having laid by their songs with which to wake the spring or it may be with them in the case of our diet of ripe grains they are too full but when spring is actually astir then are the larks abroad in the sky francis rabelais long ago the fourteenth century loved the english spring the sake of the skylark and the thoughts the bird inspired in him having appetite apparently the bird when he is fattened eating the poet longed larks in the act of singing if could he hold one of them in his hand when it was articulating he might come by its written song the telegrapher reads the scroll it unwinds but he would be content with one bird oh ever the skies should fall he made up his mind to catch larks by the basketfuls but the heavens never were known to fall in time and the poet is long since under the sod with the skylarks nesting above him to be like singing bird has been the longing of human hearts in all ages if we realize that there is medicine in song in nothing to the singer and so there is higher compliment could be paid by poet to the memory of his friend than the following dated in the seventeenth century there is happy lesson of work and good nature and lightness of heart in trying occupation too good to lose there was jolly miller once lived on the river dee he work

home on the paciﬁc coast where the varying moist and dry climates of north and south would give them the pleasures of their natural migrations but although we may never have the skylark with us we have its relative in our horned or shore larks in its habits it resembles its lark kindred in the old world singing on the wing nesting on the ground feeding on the same food walking rapidly reserving ﬂight the last resort when pursued the horned lark is so named on account of little tuft of feathers on each side of the forehead which it raises or lowers at pleasure it nests in the north very early even before the snow is all melted and brings off two or more broods in season in the autumn it exchanges its beautiful song good appetite and fattens itself on grains and berries in anticipation of possible winter hunger it may be seen all over north america at some season of the year in fall and winter in ﬂocks in california we have the mexican horned larks which cover the mesas and rise

title more than half dozen of his feathered friends he could never imagine what gave him the disagreeable epithet unless it be his own individual hatred the animal whose name clung to him like mud to be sure the coat of the bird was striped something like that of the detestable beastie but so were the coats of many other birds and he could never tell why he should be called blackbird either true he loved the marshes personal reasons but who has seen blackbird twist its toes around reed stalk and sing like mad 120 121 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook

other note and he kept it up two or three months until everybody understood that he had given himself proper name and each year he returns to remind the skunk and blackbird that he is other than himself and to assure people that he is deserving of an original name whatever else may be said of him but the skunk never has quite forgiven the bobolink his resentment of the name the ugly little creature haunts the bird in marsh and meadow watching the young bobolinks to get big enough eating exactly the bobolink waits the dandelion seeds to get ripe his dinner but dandelion seeds and little baby bobolinks are two different sorts of victuals and father bobolink swaying on his weed stem wishes skunks were not so big so he could turn on the whole family and devour them he does the bumblebees in the next stone heap it is of use wishing the old feud between the hated animal and the coveted bird is still on and skunk knows very well how to get the best of the bobolink boboli nks

out their violins and the gray spiders spin yarn on their doorsteps of course it is all purposes of their own since nobody knows that beetles and crickets and spiders particularly love to be gobbled up by bobolink but it is one and the same to the bobolink family who must have food of some sort and they could at this season of the year and under the peculiar conditions of family life get along reasonably well without meat of some sort later on when the dandelions bethink themselves to turn into round white moons that ﬂy away in the breeze and the wild oats lift their shoulder the bobolinks

robert lincoln but the male birds have come in advance of their women folk and roost high and dry out of reach of marauders it is if the mother bobolinks would be quite sure the spring storms are over before they put themselves in the way of housework until their mates arrive the male birds go on lark sailing low over meadows singing they sail each outdoing his friend sitting now on and now on the budding branch of maple or elm calling their own name s and adding whole sentences or stanzas in praise of the middle west country and of new england in particular then comes the fun of courtship when the modest lady bobolinks appear on the ground with the praise of them on their lips the males come near and ask each the hand of his should rival seek an accepted sweetheart the rightful mate drives him from the ﬁeld literally speaking and the by means dejected lover goes to another meadow bride and that is all right are all lady bobolinks alike indeed they are not or so think their devoted mates never was closer tie than binds the two to one another the male never leaves the neighborhood of his family but sings to his mate she attends fondly to those affairs which gladden the heart of nature among bird or beast or insect and she has not far to go nesting materials she may even shorten matters by shoving together bunch of dry leaves and grass that served the nest of last fall and she eats she works at every pull at blade or leaf an insect runs out of its right into her mouth it were and if the farmer happen to be plowing she will run along at the back of him on the margin of the last furrow grub or larva slipping back into the grass of the before ever he turns the next furrow if the bobolinks ﬂew north in the light of the moon they may expect good luck and sometime in june where before there were pair of birds there are now half dozen or one more than that the eggs are ﬁve or six but with most birds there telling and if the parents succeed in raising three or four children

trodden down before it is piled on the but it ca be helped and while the search is going on there are so many other things coming to pass at the same time quite unlooked that one sometimes laughs and sometimes cries there are the bumblebees instance the boys had taken them into account and fellow shins begin to warn him of danger that is mostly past and there are 124 125 126 birds of song and

observation under these circumstances to make business of studying bobolinks or other birds person must be all alone and there is the temptation to pilfer when one is all alone one catches sight of the father bobolink swinging and swaying on stout but yielding weed stalk singing all he is worth and one can not steal not that time but nest would seldom be found if the foolish birds would keep close mouth about the matter it does seem if they would learn after while but they soon stranger with two legs or four comes within sight of the spot the birds set up what they intend warning cry but which is in reality an informati on call under its spell one can walk straight to the nest which even yet on account of its color and surroundings may be taken an innocent bunch of grass provided one has good eyes the skunk has nose but passes with all its pleasures and trials and dangers and affairs late summer sees the young bobolinks out of the nest and away to the weed stalks with their parents the young males set up an independent though weakly melodiou s warble on their own account though they have not yet forgotten their baby ways and still coax the parents good bite of bug or beetle it is about the only very young bird we are acquainted with that is precocious in regard to song it is by this only that it is recognized male in this ﬁrst season being clothed like the mother and sisters and strange to say about this time the father bobolink begins to don another dress his black and white are inconspicuous if faded with the summer sun and he ceases to sing formerly the fact is he has time to sing now with the young birds to help along it is getting almost time to move and this strange bird actually seems to forget which are his own children the whole neighborhood gathers together males females and young helter each intent on gastronomic affairs and the growing of feathers the days wear away and the sere and yellow leaf of sumac and beech and maple warn all good folk that winter is getting ready to travel back home the bobolinks preen up slyly like the arab they steal away not suddenly they came in the spring but slowly and deliberately the wings of the young must have time to expand and season and endure fatigue besides bird families are not able to carry on an autumn outing so the bobolinks pass slowly toward the south feeding they go never exercising enough to lose weight but actually fattening on the journey now taking all things into account the bobolinks are the most sensible of people persons who ought to know better by experience and observation hurry on journey take time to enjoy the scenery and the people that live along the route at the journey end they are depleted tired worn to skin and bone and out of sorts with travel not so the bobolinks they have bones at the journey end they have fattened themselves into butter they have put on ﬂesh the bare spring trees put on leaves and the butter nut takes in oil all the way they eat and drink and make merry they can with so much fat on them the yesterday bird of mad music is the bird of mad appetite true they may call out chink in passing but chink means and people who

hear my song of nest it is not long in the preceding chapters we have said little about the female or mother birds in referring to single individual we have used the pronoun he if he and other were worthy of affectionate notice apology we refer our readers to the title of our book birds of song and story it is mostly the male who sings and also the male who wears the more beautiful plumage we have given him the ﬁrst or greater space it is the male who ﬁgures in myth or legend since it is he who speaks or is known conspicuous markings but always at the right season is the wife bird or the mother bird loyal and true sweet and modest of color and habit it is she who lives purpose purpose ever moves the heart of bird it is she who sacriﬁces her own individual preferences and joys the sake of others it is she mostly who makes the family fortunes it is she save in few instances who builds the nest and warms the eggs when once she has placed them where they ought to be it is the vocation or pleasure of her mate to sing it is hers to listen and surely her family cares would be dreary enough were it not the song she hears it is always her that her lord makes music if he knows her moth er term is long and monotonous many time his eye is on her when the keenest human spy fails to see where that nest is hiding the exact spot from old father bird did he help select it was he there at the start of course he was 130 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https sp arrow in early spring before actual male bird is seen coaxing his mate to think of the conveniences of some certain spot he ﬂies to corner or crotch and turns and twists and makes signs and grows excited if urging his mate to commence at that very moment and at that very spot wife bird coming to his side considers and accepts his suggestions or laughs at them the case may be should she accept the site of his choice it is not then not just at that moment it is if she fears the noise and bustle of her companion may have attracted attention she returns in some quiet hour and all by herself begins her summer work we have seen boisterous oriole lead his lady to banana leaf and his best to coax her into immediate acceptance of the location it is not until the following day that we notice the ﬁrst swinging threads and it is the same with many other birds which nest near the house perhaps the linnet or is the most persistent in choosing nest site he is sometimes seen at the business late in the fall and early winter turning about in corners and chattering to his mate and making himself so silly his mate of more sense looks on and lets him talk seeming to smile at his foolishness does he know at his age that she will be on hand at the proper time rule it is the mother bird who does all the we have seen her closely followed by the male in the case of the linnet and many of the other ﬁnches the and chippie and towhee and mocker and oriole each keeps at the side of his dear companio n and follows her on the wing singing while her mouth is full of grass or other stuff when she alights at the threshold of her nursery he alights too on near twig to follow her back to the material in moment or two by hiding in the shrub bery one can see so much of interest at but ﬁrst of all would induce parent birds to choose the home grounds preparation must be made some time in advance trees must be planted and allowed to grow naturally not in clipped or distorted forms birds love natural growth they recognize wild things and nooks when these are planned and made to grow in private grounds now and then tree root upturned pile of boughs heap of cuttings and prunings the gardener would have condemned to the ﬁre bit of space overlooked by the moist and woodpiles and logs left where they are until moss and toadstools have covered them and bugs have housed in thousand things people in their love of order and neatness dispose of at prove untold attraction to the birds

once they learn their welcome when induced single season to build in cultivated places pair of birds will return often bringing several other pairs with them it seems if certain birds are popular among their people and set the pace it were in the matter of nesting habits the places they frequent are sought after by the rest and not only by their own kind or species but by birds of dif ferent character it is with birds with different sorts make up popular neighborhood bird families not choose to wander away to some remote part of the country and make settlement indeed we have studied them birds delight in fraternal within an area of two hundred feet square in our grounds we have counted varieties in this single season of these ﬁfteen have linnet two varieties of goldﬁnch towhee mocker pewee phœbe oriole thrush grosbeak yellow warbler and some of these have nested twice or three times in our long season these birds are not seen to quarrel nor to disagree to the locations chosen each

varying notes are sound both interesting and amusing food and water are always before these birds in shady places or in the sunshine materials are spread before them the whole six months of the from

nest nest many times and ﬁnd there is choice also we have substituted young birds of the same species and each and all are adopted sometimes we ﬁnd an orphan birdling which is sure to be cared provided it be placed in the nest of any kind motherly bird of course in thus trading or causing to be adopted young birds we are careful not to give eater to and vice versa an insect fare would hardly agree with nurslings accustomed to regur gitated food like the ﬁnches and hummers once we rescue d tiny young hummer from wicked boy who had come to the treasure by theft the little thing was nearly dead with cold and hunger but we knew exactly where to ﬁnd dear motherly old soul in the person of who had just completed her nest we placed the orphan in the frail cradle so weak it could scarcely open its beak the old bird came at once cuddle d and coddled the baby only can with her small soft breast in ten minutes the wee one was having its supper and it was raised by the foster there seems to be something in the breast of mother birds at the akin to human instinct all these interesting studies go on with us at our door cats are allow ed within certain bounds and any home may be the same if the dwellers will take the trouble an ideal corner in would be one in which birds were taught conﬁdence and dependence birds are subject to cultivation and encouragement if one is just making start toward this quick movement in the shrubbery should not be indulged in loud sudden noises and throwing balls or other things at the commencing of the nest season frighten the birds one must learn to stand and listen and look birds notice movement more than sound sidewise motions disturb where straight methods are not noticed by gradually accustoming birds to one presence and then to one voice and then to the near approach one may succeed in taming wild birds at we have had the ﬁnches and linnets and towhees and and perfectly trustful even to some of the males whose presence at the nests is not absolutely essential we have had the parent birds feed the young from our hands we standing at the nest to nesting itself the fun to be had of spring morning is beyond description

garden cushion the gathers bits of lichen from the bough on which our hands rest the phœbe scarcely waits us to step aside that she may bite the shreds from the jute to mix with her mud the sparrow scratching away 133 134 135 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https the tree bug and bit of leaf at one and the same time treads on our toes in her fearlessness the hummer fans our faces with her wings should we happen to be near the counter when the young birds are just big enough to tumble out of the nest then fairly begin the ground is alive with them of many sizes and features more especially to beak they peep and scream and coax by sundown those not old enough to hop or ﬂutter to safe place are the source of great anxiety we are obliged to go out and help put the babies to bed and these twilight times more than the whole day are the pussy understands the turmoil she skulks and prowls and scarcely dares to breathe in her silent hopes it is then that we dare breathe and many other things this incessant war on the feline tribe must be kept up would any one have birds around his home there is one thing at that puzzles us why mother birds pass carelessly by so much good material they pick up this grass or string or feather to drop it another and then why they pass by this or that ﬂy or other insect and pick up another they probably have their reasons the same they choose between equally good nest locations it is on this account that we are particular to have variety of everything in their way it is at that we take especial care of the garden table we furnish everything we imagine acceptable soon the young of ﬁnches or sparrows are out of the nest they are brought to the table by their parents all the birds have sweet tooth they like cookies and pie and sugar and will be remembered in the case of the sparrows good molasse it was when the tourist robins were here that we thought about the molasses the robins would take it clear the sparrows did so we mixed it with meal they came and looked at it and tasted and liked it very well thinking to score point the temperance people we mixed some old bourbon with the pudding tipsy robin would be funny sight but not morsel of the meal would they ever touch we kept up the game several days it resulting at last in all the robins leaving the grounds in disgust then we tried it on the sparrows but to purpose every bird grew suspicious and we had to give it up this proved to us that birds cultivate the sense of smell birds in general are like the donkey before whose nose is suspended wisp of hay tied to the end of pole to make him go of course in the case of the donkey the pole goes in advance of the nose and it long while before the wisp and the appetite have passing acquaintance with the birds at our home the wisp is always out so they are in hurry to migrate they not leave us so much short visit to their folks in mexico until the molt is well under way some summer visitants even molt completely with us and it is sorry season by the time young bird is able to hustle himself he would know his own mother she has shed the feathers around the beak leaving her nose or mouth so grotesque one has to laugh seeming to understand the joke is at their expense some of our birds at this time keep well hidden and come only to the edges of the shrubbery food or if overtaken in the open they run fast their legs can carry them without bit of tail is hopping now under the window chirping her happy note but hiding if we look at her hummer which yesterday took honey from the ﬂowers we held in our lips sits on tiny twig the picture of despair because her neck feathers are so thin mocker who has drank all summer from the dish with the bees peeps at her shadow and preens imaginary quills half of them are on the ground by the table phœbe sits alone on the housetop wailing thinking doubt she is singing and looking the picture of distress with one and not enough of her ordinary neckerchief around her neck to cover the bare skin of it and the nests where are they just where they were but they are faded and old and deserted never does young bird go back to the nest after it has once left it though some people believe they use it bed until long into the autumn we have not seen them so they scorn the old thing is it full of mites it can hold of course it is especially if it be linnet nest when the third brood came out in the same nest we found it so infested with mites almost invisible that we could not touch it and the poor little birdlings had to bide their time in getting away it is supposed to be on account of these parasites that some birds compose their nests of elling weeds however we have not known any of the nests near us to be disturbed by these parasites save those in which several broods are reared we have ﬂat on each successive ﬂoor of which linnet and phœbe have nested phœbe nest is mud linnet is straw and hair each builds atop of the others it may grow to be yet many of the mother birds sing at the or linnet keeps continual twitter while incubating so also the goldﬁnches these notes are low and very musical and happy the phœbe speaks her mournful note under the eaves while on the nest by close 136 137 138 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https when other things are noiseless one may detect the almost inaudible note of some of the hummers the ear of grows keen by practice there are low nearly inarticulate whisperings among the birds in summer days never heard by those who have not learned the art of listening the nest of the summer yellowbird may be within six feet of person on the hunt it who though of keen eye may never ﬁnd it lack of keen an ear to hear the low note of the mother bird behind the foliage by close observation one may come to disprove many things said against the birds instance neighbor told us to be careful how we encouraged the orioles and phœbes to nest in our grounds if we did want them to eat up all our usual with us in such cases we accepted the warning with pinch of salt and took to making observations on our own account locating ourselves behind an open wind ow near the beehives we watched vine trellis with top bar uncovered offered safe footing to phœbe on she came with ﬁve young phœbes hatched on the ﬂat under the eaves the young birds were whining food plain any words can be they cried bees bees please and bees they were to have dinner the mother led them to the trellis bar where they squatted in row peeping their longings bees were ﬂying thicker than hail the mother canted her head from side to side the black eye of the upward cant searching the insects why you help yourself we wondered in few minutes the bum bum of the drones was heard then mother phœbe darted and darted and darted each time she snapped big bumming drone which she killed by banging its head against the bar then it was taken by little phœbe or more often by two phœbes who tugged at the creature until it came in two parts or was cunningly appropriated whole by one of them this went on until all were the time being appeased and the family ﬂew off by the middle of next day they returned and went through the same performances very amusing to the witnesses inside the window now not single worker was touched and the mother phœbe knew the exact hour the ﬂying of drones these lazy shiftless bumming fellows never leave the hives until the day is far advanced and the sun has warmed things up so not breakfast but dinner was made of the drones the orioles we were willing to give them chance to speak themselves they appeared about april 10th usual and straight the bee corner of the garden they went i told you so said the neighbor we watched there were and vines in that part of the grounds and to these the orioles hastened fast their wings could take them the beehives sit under row of so thickly covered with spines that one can not take hold of them without gloves but this pair of orioles ran up and down and in and out witho ut fear these and many other did they examin minutely pecking away fast they could move their beaks right at the entrance to the hives they went on straggling briers but not bee did they touch we were close to them we wished to be suddenly we scared them away before they should have devoured every secret and there was retreat our neighbor the orioles had been eating the little green that infest early in the spring later they took to watching the bees and we resumed our watch of the orioles it was midsummer and the young birds were all about crying bread or rather bees though their pronunciation was not so distinct that of the young phœbes the parent orioles took their stand right on the doorstep of the hives and waited with head slightly turned alert ready bite not worker did they touch but when drone came bumming along he was nabbed quick wink all which lasts about two months with us did the orioles patronize the beehives unmolested did the tireless workers come and run in at the entrance when the summer yellowbirds have three or four hungry mouths to feed just watch at the open window behind the and see what you see little green caterpillars make nourishing food baby yellowbirds the parents might be running up and down amid the green and white of the bush just effect of color but they are not those little soft green biscuits are the objects of their ramble it has been an open question to whether old birds carry water to the young in the case of tame canaries they have been seen to regur gitate whole cropful of the liquid into waiting parched throats so we may conclude that young birds require water in the case of very young ird who was deprived of its mother we raised it while at least on milk sweetened with honey feeding it with an such surgeons use the milk was good substitute such animal food the young of hummers are accustomed to when young come out of the nest and many weeks they are either very fearless or their sight is not good surely it is not the latter unless it be atoned by 139 140 141 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https sense of smell they come to ﬂowers we hold up to them and even light on our hands and faces following us in the shrubbery rule young birds are suspicious and wary they know by instinct how and where to hide after sundown is the time to see interesting events connected with supper and bedtime by close and quiet watching one may see one self where and how young birds sleep some retire to the same bough or bush each night family of slept in row on an orange twig every night two weeks in plain sight of us and near six feet from our hands the parents had been blessed with unusual success in this particular brood bringing off six these all slept in row heads and tails whispering the softest of notes until quite dark we have never been able to account all the that disappear in now and then cracked bits are found in ﬁelds and woods but only bits one might get some information from the ants that are always prowling about detached morsels of animal life the birds themselves may eat or hide them lest they tell tales we have found shells far away from any nests if they had been carried on purpose sometimes they lie in the nest bottom in powder it is worth while to take peep into every nest just to get pointers t never to get birdlings and one peeps should not be too frequent it disturbs family order and conﬁdence besides if one takes to peeping when the birds are nearly ﬂedged they often become frightened and leave the nest too immature to warra nt freedom and safety young birds are seen to sit or cling to the edge of the nest long before they are able to ﬂy at night they snuggle down into the warmth much food is essential to young birds but has an end like all good times when the late peaches turn their rosiest cheek to the autumn sun and the husk of the beechnut opens its pale lips then are the nests that were so lately the center of attracti on tenantless and neglected old birds in passing take notice of them and the hungry juveniles pay visible heed what care they cradles now that the universal cry is bread and butter please baby zephyrs nap on the linings and the rain runs its slim ﬁngers through the fading meshes even the domestic feline who was wont to peep into the heart of every one of them longer is discovered inquiring into the nesting habits of birds forsaken are the nests naked are the boughs we will leave them the winter winds to the winter winds will ravel more bark next year nests and they will make the molt their softest wrappers linings and it is the winte r winds that will swirl the dead leaves into lint and pull the weed stalks into ﬁber therefore long live the winter winds chapter xvi the romance of ornithology the birds must know who wisely sings will sing they the common air has generous wings songs make their way what bird is that the song is good and eager eyes go peering through the dusky wood in glad surprise the birds must know helen h unt j ackson everybody knows ornithology means discourse about people have discoursed about birds ever since spoken or written language gave us the means of exchanging thoughts in the biblical history of the creation birds occurred in the ﬁfth epoch of time when the evolution of grass and herbs and trees and seeds and fruits had made them paradise with the 142 143 144 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https and trees and seeds and fruits had evolved variable diet the feath ered folk and by instinct they have continued to follow after their food migrating on merry tours the wide world over lovers of them from earliest dates have discoursed of their ways and means of their habits their favorite resorts their uses relativ to cultivation of lands their faults in connection with civilization students of nature have divided the birds into classes and speci es the human race itself is divided order is heaven ﬁrst law ornithologists have taught us to distinguish it in the study of birds and so we have the groups always with reference to individual habits and anatomical peculiarities in the old world ornithology science dates perhaps from aristotle 384 years before christ true he was teacher of b c on the subject but he set students to thinking but there were students before aristotle if not students of science they were students of religion it is to religion in many forms that we owe the romance of ornithology we may call this phase of the subject superstition the word itself is almost gruesome to the unlettere d imagination it suggests uncanny things ghosts and goblins and other creatures that are supposed to wander around in the dark because they were never seen at midday or any other time to the educated person actual faith in ghosts and goblins has given place to mildly fanciful imagination which indulges in the ﬂavor of superstition one takes light desserts after full meal and so we have the romance of superstition the intelligent stopping to consider that the word itself means standing still to stare at something an attitude of reverence so to speak we see how religion in ornithology preceded the romance of it certain of the birds waited on the deities or had access to their presence in consequence of which they were set apart and protected sometimes they were prophets of the gods foretelling future events with accuracy their ﬂights were noted by religious devotees who unconsciously to themselves probably and certainly unsuspected by their followers were sure to be out at migration times at such times should the birds choose natural course past city and be seen only after they had left it behind them the prophet knew in the depths of his religious being that the gods had doomed that city it was only when the study of birds an actual science developed the fact that these denizens of the air depended more upon climate and necessary diet than upon the will of gruesome gods that the religion of ornithology gave place to romance and romance is the course of real lends fanciful touch to ﬁgures and data and apologizes to the average student intermissions that seem dedicated to frolic in the universe of romance north america has its full share preceding the romance was and still is among the native tribes the religion of superstition the deities foretell certain death of persons among the eskimos by the passing of bluejay or the croak of raven our own poet edgar allan poe was not an eskimo but he indulged in the superstitions about the bird when he permitted the raven to perch above his door many of the arctic tribes are known to protect the ominous bird to this day the indians of alaska revere and even fear it like black spirit from the land of demons song and story among american aborig ines are replete with bird superstition so prominent was it that early historians made mention of it to preserve it and students of languages are putting it into books so that romance and legend may not pass away with our native indians the government itself is preserving the history of american superstition among its precious archives reports of the ethnological bureau are entertaining reading vacation times true they are heavy volumes in some cases but there are supplements were these reports placed in more school and other libraries the inclination to read more objectionable and not half so entertaining literature would go quickly out like match without burning the ﬁngers to those who ﬁnd fascination in prehistoric legends the study of bird representation on the ancient pottery of some of our western indians and in the mounds of the mississippi valley is offered in some of these government reports they are very mine of suggestion and information imagination subtle guide to many mind runs fast and faster on before while one reads and one wonders how it came to pass one never knew about government reports before the ethnological bureau is the poet corner of our roman ce of our dull facts and ﬁgures without its unsleeping eye forever scanning the sky of unwritten literature gems how would some of us know about the history of the human race preserved by the iroquois indians and that birds had wing if not hand in the peopling of america at least 145 146 147 birds of song and story by elizabeth and joseph project gutenberg ebook https course america was all the world to these indians and naturally enough their priests and poets combined to give some adequate genesis the people it is said that story once started on its rounds in civilized society gathers facts and things it goes until at not before very own original parent would recognize it not so the legends that have come to us through savage tongues simple to start with they maintain their original type without trace of addition what students gather us of is correct though the ﬁrst text had been copyrighted by its author note this simplicity in all barbaric legends the discourse coming straight to the facts and leaving of f when it is done this one legend referred to of the origi n of the human race makes so good preface to the closing rhyme of our text that we are tempted to give it that special purpose according to this story of the iroquois indians it is to birds that woman owes her history unconsciously to these natives of america they identiﬁed woman with birds and birds wings all time unconsciously perhaps to herself woman has also identiﬁed her sex with birds and bird wings though in different relation to that of the iroquois the legend will need further introduction to the girl or woman of america who may become interested in birds of song and story there was once time when all the earth was hidden under great waters island or continent gave foothold tree torn from its moorings afforded rest to tired foot or wing ﬁnny and winged people were all the inhabitants in being birds soared unceasingly in the air and ﬁsh disported their beautiful armor in the water in the consciousness of bird and ﬁsh there was need of higher intelligences than themselves they watched and waited some hint some glimpse of other and superior beings one day the birds congregating in the sky discoursing on this very matter beheld lovely woman dropping out of the far blue hurriedly they talked of possible means of saving her from drowning they had subtle sense that this falling object with arms outstretched like wings was the being they hoped one of their number prophet suggested the means the lovely being dropped toward the great sea the birds came together and lapped wings over wings in thick feathered island upon the soft deck of this throbbing boat the beautiful being descended and lay panting slowly and lovingly her soft hand caressed the wings of her benefactors she lifted the variously tinted plumage of the breasts on which she reclined and kissed the down of them that was long long ago we will conclu our text with the ending of the poem preceding the ﬁrst chapter in our book repeating four lines of the same and dedicating this same ending to the birds while the rings its discourse they are sitting on the spires psalm and anthem song and carol quaver
