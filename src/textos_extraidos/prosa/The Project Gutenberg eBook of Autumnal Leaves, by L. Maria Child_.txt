gold w hittier what remarkably pretty girl barton has nursery maid said vernon to her daughter yes mamma and it seems quite useless servant to be so handsome what good will it her she glanced at the mirror she spoke and seemed less satisfied than usual with her own pretty face she was thinking to herself if i had much beauty she has i shouldn t despair of winning similar idea flashed across vernon s mind she noticed the involuntary appeal to the mirror therefore she sighed she answered instead of doing her good it will doubtless prove misfortune some dissipated lord will take fancy to her but he will soon become weary of her and will marry her to the first clown who can be hired to take her very likely replied miss julia and after living with nobleman she can never be happy with person of her own the prospect of such future in reserve the rustic beauty seemed by means painful to the aristocratic young lady indeed one might conjecture from her manner that she regarded it more than suitable punishment presuming to be handsomer than her superiors in rank flush passed over the countenance of her brother edward who sat reading at the opposite window but the ladies busy with their embroidery and netting did not observe it the lower extremity of their grounds was separated from barton s merely by hedge of hawthorns few weeks previous he was walking there his attention had been attracted by joyful exclamations from their neighbour s children over lupine that began to show its valves above the ground he turned involuntarily and when he saw the young girl who accompanied them he felt little glow of pleasant surprise curl around his heart if some entirely new and very beautiful wild flower had unexpectedly appeared before him that part of the garden became his favourite place of resort and if day passed without his obtaining glimpse of the lovely stranger he was conscious of an undefined feeling of disappointment one day when the children were playing near by their rubber ball bounced over into vernon s grounds when he saw them searching it among the hawthorns he reached across the hedge and presented it to their attendant he raised his hat and bowed he did so and she blushed she took it from his hand after this accidental introduction he never passed her without similar salutation and she always coloured at mark of courtesy so unusual from gentleman to person in her humble condition the degree of interest she had excited in his mind rendered it somewhat painful to hear his mother s careless prophecy of her future destiny few days afterward he was walking with his sister when barton s maid passed with the children miss julia graciously accosted the little ones but ignored the presence of their attendant seeing her brother make his usual sign of deferential politeness she exclaimed what strange person you are edward one would suppose you were passing duchess i dare say you would just the same if cousin alfred were with us certainly i should he replied i am accustomed to regulate my actions by my own convictions not by those of another person you know i believe in such thing natural nobility 10 11 12 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https and if servant happens to have pretty face you consider her born duchess i suppose said julia such kind of beauty that we have just passed where the pliant limbs move with unconscious dignity and harmonized features are illuminated by moral grace that emanates from the soul does seem to to have received from nature herself an unmistakeable patent of nobility so you know this person inquired his sister he replied i have merely spoken to her on the occasion of returning ball that one of the children tossed over into our grounds but casually i have seen her her countenance and manners impress with the respect that you feel high it s pity you were not born in the of america retorted his sister pettishly i sometimes think so myself he quietly replied but let us gather some of these wild flowers julia instead of disputing about conventional distinctions concerning which you and i can never his sister coldly accepted the flowers he offered her temper was clouded by the incident of the morning it vexed her that edward had never said or implied so much concerning her style of beauty and she could not forgive the tendencies of mind which spoiled him the part she wished him to perform in the world means of increasing his own importance and thereby advancing her interests she had the misfortune to belong to an english family extensively connected with the rich and aristocratic without being themselves largely endowed with wealth cousin alfred the son of her father s older brother was heir to title and consequently she measure d every thing by his standard the income of the family was more than sufficient comfort and gentility but the unfortunate tendency to assume the habits of others their standard rendered what might have been source of enjoyment cause of discontent their life was constant struggle to keep up appearances beyond their means all natural thoughts and feelings were kept in perpetual harness drilled to walk blindfolded the prescribed round of conventional forms like horse in with this exception that their routine spoiled the free paces of the horse without grinding any bark edward s liberal soul had early rebelled against this system he had experienced vague consciousness of walking in fetters ever since he was reproved bringing home favourite to pass the vacation with him when he was twelve years old he could not then be made to understand why manly intelligent boy who was tradesma n s son was less noble than young lord smallsoul cousin alfred s and within the last few weeks circumstances had excited his thoughts to unusual activity concerning natural and artificial distinctions he walked in the garden book in hand he never failed to see the beautiful if she were anywhere within sight and she always perceived him in her eyes he was like bright star while he was refreshed by vision of her he was by the beauty of an opening flower distinction of rank was such fixed fact in the society around them that the star and the flower dreamed of union much they did but cupid who is the earliest republican on record willed that things should not remain in that state bunch of fragrant violets were offered with smile and received with blush and in the blush and the smile an arrow lay concealed then volumes of poems were loaned with passages marked and every word of those passages were stereotyped on the heart of the reader long time he was ignorant of her name but hearing the children call her sibella he inquired her other name and they told him it was flower he thought it an exceedingly poetic and appropriate name most young men of twenty would have thought under similar circumstances he noticed the sequestered lanes where she best loved to rove when sent out with the children exercise and those lanes became his own favourite places of resort wild flowers furnished graceful and harmless topic of conversation yet love made even those simple things his messengers patrician edwar d offered the rustic sibella an eglantine saying this has peculiar charm above all flowers it is so fragrant and delicately tinted so gracef ully untrained and so modest in its pretensions it always seems to like beautiful young maiden without artificial culture but naturally refined and poetic the first time i saw you i thought of flowering eglantine and i have never since looked at the shrub without being reminded of she listened half abashed and half delighted she never saw the flower again without thinking of him the next day after this little adventure she received copy of moore s melodies with her name elegantly written therein the songs all sparkling with fancy and warm with love were well suited to her sixteen years and to that critical period in her heart s experience she saw in them reflection 13 14 15 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https her own young soul dreamily floating in over waters the mystery attending the gift increased its charm the postman left it at the door and one knew whence it came within the same envelope was pressed blossom of the eglantine placed in sheet of parisian letter gracefully orname nted with coloured arabesque of eglantines and german on it the following verses were inscribed to sibella flow er there is form more light and fair than human tongue can tell it seems spirit of the air she is flower si belle the lovely cheek more faintly flushed than ocean s rosy shell is like pearl that blushed she is flower si belle her glossy hair in simple braid with softly curving swell might well have crowned grecian maid she is flower si belle her serious and eyes of gentle thoughts tell serene summer ev ning skies she is flower si belle her graceful mouth was outlined free by cupid s magic spell bow his sure archery she is flower si belle and thence soft silv ry tones flow like rills along the dell making sweet music they go she is flower si belle fairer still is the modest mind pure crystal well in mountain solitude enshrined she is flower si belle note at the bottom of the verses explained that the french word si belle meant so beautiful the poetry was that of young man of twenty but simple maiden of sixteen who was herself the subject of the lines saw more beauty in them than critic could find in the best inspirations of shakespeare or milton and then to think that gentleman who understood french should write verses to her it was wonderful she would soon have dreamed of wearing the crown of england the next time she met edward vernon her cheeks were flushed more deeply than ocean s rosy but she never alluded to the book or the verses she said to herself perhaps he did nt send them and then i should feel so ashamed of supposing he did the secret was half betrayed on his part whether intentionally or unintentionally she did not know he began by calling her miss flower then he called her sibella but ever after the reception of the verses he said sibelle they were so reserved toward each other and barton s children were apparently so much the objects of his attention during their rambles that their dreamy romance might have gone on uninterrupted months longer had not human foot stepped within their fairy circle lord smallsoul he rode abroad one day was attracted by the flower si belle his grosser nature 16 17 18 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https more selfish habits were uncurbed by the respectful diffidence which restrained edward s love he became bold and importunate in his attentions if he took it granted that any rural beauty could be purchased with nobleman s gold the poor girl could not stir out of doors without being liable to his unwelcome intrusion the more unwelcome because the presence of the false lover expelled the true one edward kept carefully aloof watching the proceedin gs of the profligate nobleman with jealous indignation he painfully felt that he had right to assume guardianship over the young girl and that any attempt to so would bring him into collision with her persecutor likely to end in publicity by means favourable to her reputation the rural belle was inexperienced in the world s ways but she had been trained by prudent mother and warned against the very dangers that now beset her path therefore with many blushes she begged barton to excuse her from walking out with the children confessing that lord smallsoul sought every opportunity of urging her to go and live with him in italy though she never would accept one of the many rich presents he was always offering her barton warmly commende d her and promised protection after some conversation she said the children tell that vernon has often joined you in your walks did he ever say he was in love with you sibella promptly replied never he is always very and he has never made you any presents has he inquired the lady the maiden lowered her eyes and blushed deeply she had been trained to strict observance of the truth but she did not know certainly who sent moore s melodies and heart and conscience both pleaded with her not to say any thing that might involve her friend in blame after moment s hesitation she answered evasively he has sometimes offered flowers madam when he was gathering them the children and i thought it harm to take the book of poems and the wonderful verses framed in flowery arabesques remained secret between herself and him who sent them but barton noticed the sudden blush and the involuntary hesitation and she resolved to elicit some information from the children in manner not likely to excite their curiosity lord smallsoul who from infancy had been an object of excessive indulgence was not to be easily baffled in his selfish plans night and day he or his confidential servant was prowling about barton s grounds his assiduities became positive nuisance and excited much gossip in the neighbourhood miss julia vernon took occasion to say to barton it is really surprising his lordship should make himself so ridiculo us instead of bestowing his attentions upon beautiful ladies whose rank in life is nearer to his own he knows however that ladies would scorn to accept such homage he bestows upon your servant and i suppose he is not yet ready to enter into matrimonial barton thought to herself that the dissolute nobleman would receive very prompt and gracious answer if he invited miss julia to enter into such bonds she however suppressed the smile that was rising to her lips and said i don t wonder at his being fascinate d by sibella she is gifted with extraordinary beauty i am truly thankful on her own account and the sake of her worthy parents that she is discreet she is lovely i confess i should myself rejoice in such daughter there was slightly contemptuous motion in the muscles of miss vernon s mouth she replied you appear to think her paragon the girl is pretty enough too pretty her own good since she was born to be servant but i can not imagine what attractions she can have gentleman who is accustomed to the distinguished air of ladies of some people prefer the eglantine to the garden rose replied barton your brother is accustomed to ladies of rank but i imagine he appreciates sibella s beauty more highly than you what reason have you thinking so quickly inquired miss julia half mischievously and altogether imprudently barton replied the children heard him tell her that she was like an eglantine which of all flowers was his favourite and they say he always wore an eglantine in his vest long there was one to be up rose miss vernon hastily and with haughty toss of the head said emphatically i thank you very much having told this good morning the amiable neighbour foreseeing storm immediately repented of what she had said but it was impossible to recall it she looked out of the window and saw that miss vernon was excited to such degree to make her forget the patrician languor which usually characterized her movements obeying an impulse once in her life she walked rapidly across the garden to the paternal mansion if case of life and death were impending she startled her mother with this 19 20 21 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https annunciation go directly to cousin alfred and tell him he must devise some means to remove edward from this neighbourhood forthwith you know he has been promising some time past to secure suitable situation him and unless you see to having it done immediately you may prepare yourself to have your son disgrace the whole family by marrying she then repeated what she had just heard and added you know mother that edward never could be induced to pay so much regard to the distinctions of rank he ought to it would be just like him to go off to gretna green with servant girl if he happened to take it into his foolish head that she was paragon of beauty and great was the consternation in all branches of the vernon family and their alarm was not little increased when edward frankly declared that it would be easy to procure suitable education sibella and then she would be desirable companion any gentleman in the land how his father glowered at him how his mother wept and what glances his sister hurled from her haughty eyes need not be told he retreated to his own apartment and several days remain ed there most of the time revolving plans the future some of them of the most romantic kind he longed secret interview with sibella to avow his love promise eternal constancy and obtain from her similar pledge in return but his nice sense of honour restrained him from taking any step that might cast shadow upon her he made several attempts to see her openly but he was close ly watched and she never appeared barton informed her that the family had taken offence at the attentions he paid her the anxious conferences in edward s family ended with an announcement from his father that he must prepare to start italy the next week traveling companion young nobleman about to make the tour of europe meanwhile vernon and her daugh ter vented some of their mortification and vexation upon barton blaming her keeping such handsome servant to make trouble in gentlemen s families that lady becoming more and more uneasy at the state of things deemed it prudent to write warning letter to sibella s parents and the good mother came to her child immediately she found her darling in the depths of girlish misery alleviated however by the happy consciousness that she had nothing to conceal weeping on the maternal bosom she told all her simple story not even reserving the secret of the book and the verses but when her mother said they ought to be returned to vernon she remonstrate d warmly oh mother don t ask to that if you i shall be sorry i told you i don t know that he sent them he never said so the eglantine made think that he did but i am afraid i should seem to him like bold vain girl if he knew that i thought her mother being assured that presents had been offered and love never spoken of yielded to her argument she was allowed to retain the precious volume and the wonderful verses which were hidden away carefully miser s treasures vernon the father had private conversa tion with flower the morning after her arrival he assumed so proud tone that he roused corresponding degree of pride in the worthy woman who curtly assured him that her daughter would find difficulty in forming good connection and would never be permit ted to enter any family that objected to her the gentleman thanked her with cold politeness and she parted from him with very short courtesy that evening note came miss sibella flower barton placed it in the mother s hand who opened it and read dear s ibelle forgive venturing to call you so i am compelled to depart italy and that must be my excuse i have reflected much upon the subject and young i am i feel that it is my duty not to refuse the eligible situation my relatives have procured it has given great pain to come to this conclusion but i console myself with the reflection that some day or other i shall be free to follow my own inclinations i can never forget you never cease to love you and i can not part without saying farewell and conjuring you to cherish the memory of the blissful moments we have passed together ask barton to allow an hour s interview with you this evening she and your mother can both be present if they think proper they will see by this request that my views are honourable and my professions sincere yours with undying af fection 22 23 24 25 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https flower promptly decided to see the young gentleman herself he was accordingly sent and came full of love and hope but sibella who was kept in ignorance of the note was requested not to intrude upon their conference therefore he saw the mother only in answer to all his vehement protestations and earnest entreaties she answered sibella is mere child and it is my duty to guard her inexperience next to seeing her deceived by false professions i have always dreaded her marrying into proud family who would look down upon her i will go to america and make position myself independent of my family before i ask her to share my destiny replied the enthusiastic lover i thank you vernon you have behaved nobly toward my child and my heart blesses you it but i had sister who married above her rank and i can not forget the consequences they were very young when they were married and never were two young creatures so much in love she was good she was handsome but his family treated her if she was nt worthy to black their shoes and they had such an influence upon him that he at last repented of the step he had taken she felt it and it made her very miserable you are young sir too young to be certain that your mind won t i know perfectly well that my mind can never change he replied eagerly this is not such boyish whim you seem to suppose it is deep abiding feeling it is impossible that i can ever the mother quietly replied my sister s husband said the same and yet he did edward vernon internally cursed that sister s heartless husband but he contented himself with saying such love his must have been very dif ferent from the feelings that inspire his intreaties were unavailing to procure an interview with sibella the prudent mother concealed the fact that he had awakened an interest in her daughter s heart to all his arguments she would only shake her head and reply you are too young to know your own mind mr too young how cold and contemptuous that sounded he was not in state of mind to appreciate the foresight and kindness which strove to shield him from his own rashness she seemed to him proud and his father and perhaps pride did help her prudence little yet when he was gone away the good woman sat down and cried she sympathized so heartily with the trouble of those young hearts sibella sobbed herself to sleep that night though unconscious that edward intended to leave england he watched the window of her chamber till the light of her lamp went out in darkness that star will shine more he said he return ed slowly to his own room looked out upon the long time then laid himself down to weep and dream of green lanes fragrant with the eglantine the next morning flower requested her daughter to prepare their return home since there was other way of relieving barton from the perpetual intrusion of the shameless nobleman and his troublesome servant gentle sibella was she experienced feeling of hatred toward lord smallsoul who like an odious beast had rushed into her paradise trampling its flowers she did not dispute her mother s decision she felt that it was judicious but she also stood at the window long time looking out upon the associated with so many pleasant memories her eyes were moist when she turned and said mother before we go away i should like to bid to some of the old places where i have walk ed children you can go with if you are afraid of my meeting mr sadly and sympathizingly her mother answered you can not meet vernon my child he has gone to italy gone she exclaimed and the sudden paleness and the thrilling tone cut her mother s heart she soothed her tenderly and after while sibella raised her head with an effort to assume maidenly pride and said he never told he loved i sometimes thought he did but it was very foolish of if he cared he would have said i will think more about the mother was strongly tempted to tell how ardently and how honourably he loved but she thought to herself it would only serve to keep alive hopes destined to end in so she put strong constraint on her feminine sympathies and remained silent they went forth into the green lanes bright with sunshine but gloomy to eyes that saw them through veil of tears when sibella came to the bush from which edward had broken the first eglantine he offered her she gazed at it mournfully and throwing herself on the bosom of her best earthly friend sobbed out oh mother mother i have been so happy here 26 27 28 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https my poor dear child she replied you don t know how sorry i am you but these feelings will pass away with time you are very young and life is all before the maiden looked up with inexpressible sadness in her eyes and answered yes mother i am young but life is all behind there is wide chasm in the story there was in sibella s life that brief dream of the past would not unite itself with the actual present she could form bridge between them it remained by itself like an island warm with sunshine and fragrant with eglantines in the midst of cold grey waves because she herself was changed all things around her seemed chang ed the young men especially appeared like different race of beings since she had learned to compare them with that poetic youth who gazed so reverently at the evening star and loved the wers if they were living things he had kindled her imagination well her heart she perceived soul in nature of which she had been unconscious till he revealed it ah how lonely she was now in all the wide world there was not one mortal who could understand what that simple country girl had found or what she had lost she herself did not comprehend it she only had an uneasy sense of always seeking something she could never find she lived among her former associates like one who has returned from an excursion into finding the air of earth chilly and its colours dim but employments are amaranths in the garden of life they live through all storms and survive all changes of the seasons her duties were numerous and conscientiously perform ed and through this pathway of necessity apparently so rugged she soon arrived at state of cheerful serenity in few months her parents were induced to join band of emigrants coming to america and the novelty of change proved beneficial to her that sunny island in her experience was not forgotten but it smiled upon her farther in the distance there was joyful palpitation at her heart when she found eglantines growing wild in america under the name of roses she opened the verses which had seemed to her si belle the flower was faded and its sweetness gone but memory was redolent of its fragrance she was never told that edward vernon had written two letters to her after he left england and she had almost persuaded herself that his looks and tones were not so significant they had seemed she had materials to form definite hope but it became the leading object of her life so to improve herself that he would have cause to be ashamed of her if he ever should happen to come to america in the accomplishment of this project she was continually stimulated by the example of american girls who obtained the means of education by their own manual industry and ended by becoming teachers of the highest class her parents were delighted with her diligen ce and perseverance and did what they could to aid her never suspecting that the impelling power came chiefly from latent feeling which they hoped was extinct so she worked onwards and upwards with hands and mind and soon found pleasure in the development itself meanwhile the beautiful english flower attracted admirers of various grades her parents hoped she would give the preference to merchant of good character who was in very prosperous circumstances she was aware that such marriage would be great advantage to them and she loved them so much that she wished her beauty could be the means of bringing them prosperity she tried to love the worthy merchant but her efforts were unavailing she was always thinking to herself he never writes poetry to and he never tells about the stars edward used to gather and bind them so gracefully with wreaths of ivy but this gentleman buys house flowers tied into pyramids on wires the poor things look so uncomfortable just i shall feel if i consent to be sold and tied up ah if he were only more like vernon i should like to oblige my good father and mother the soliloquy ended with humming to herself there s nothing half so sweet in life love s young when the time came definite answer to the merchant she told her parents she had rather keep school than marry they looked at each other and sighed but they asked questions concerning the memory of her heart the prospect of owning farm combined with an eligible offer sibella teacher soon afterward attracted them to the far west the grandeur and freedom of nature in that new region the mighty forests the limitless prairies the luxuriant vegetation produced sudden expansion in that youthful soul trained amid the cultiv ated gardens and carefully clipped hedges of england 29 30 31 32 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https experienced new birth in poetry the heart experiences religi on all that she had previously known of beauty seemed tame and cold compared with the wild charm of that improvised scenery but more than ever she was oppressed with sense of mental loneliness nature was inspiring but it had sympathy with the human soul which longed more responsive companionship more intimate commun ion the maiden needed friend into whose soul the calm sunset of the prairies would infuse the same holy light that penetrated her own in such moods the looks and tones of edward vernon came back with vivid distinctness at times she longed inexpressibly to know whether he ever had such lively reminiscences of the poor country girl whom his influence had led into the regions she never dreamed of before nature looked at her with the same tranquil smile and gave answer fortunately the active duties of life left but few hours such reveries otherwise the abrupt termination of her long dream might have proved hazardous the sudden wakening of somnambulist english emigrant visited her father s farm he came from barton s neighbourhood and in the course of conversation chanced to mention that vernon s son and daughter were both married until that moment sibella had not realized the strength of the hope she cherished she veiled her disappointment from the observation of others and her mother had the good sense to forbear saying i told you conversation passed between them on the subject but when sibella retired to her sleeping apartment she gazed out on the moonlighted solitude of the prairie long time and thought the expression of the scene never seemed so sad she said to herself my mother told truly that beautiful experience was indeed dream of early youth and only she was under the necessity of returning to chicago the next day to attend to her school in another department of the school was teacher from new england farmer s son who had worked with his hands in the summer and studied diligently in the winter till he had become scholar of more than common attainments he taught school during the week and occasionally preached on sunday not because he was too indolent to perform manual labour or because he considered it ungenteel he was attracted toward book s by genuine thirst knowledge and he devoted himself to moral and intellectual teaching the simple reason that god had formed him it he loved the occupation and was therefore emin ently successful in it this young man had some time been in love with sibella flower without obtaining any signs of encouragement from her but there is much truth in the old adage about the facility of catching heart at the rebound he never wrote poetry or spoke eloquently about the beauties of scenery his busy intellect employed itself chiefly with history science and ethics but though he was unlike edward vernon he was gentle good and wise and after her had vanished utterly sibella became aware that his society furnished pleasant companionsh ip heart and mind their intimacy gradually increased and they finally married being desirous to purchase land and build house they continued to earn money by teaching the desired home with its various belongings seeme d likely to be soon completed without great expense william wood had all the capabilities of genuine yankee he could hew logs and plane them make rustic tables benches and arbours and mend his own shoes and saddles during the intervals of preparing lectures on chemistry and astrono my in this imperfect existence there is perhaps combinati on of circumstances more favourable to happiness than the taste to plan beautiful home practical skill to embody the graceful ideas and the necessity of doing it with one s own hands those who have homes prepared them by hired architects gardeners and upholsterers can not begin to imagine the pleasure of making nest one s self william was always planning bridges arbours and fences and sibella never saw beautiful wild shrub or vine without marking it to be removed to the vicinity of their cabin she told him all about her early and said she should always cherish grateful remembrance of it because it had proved such powerful agent to wake up the dormant energies of her soul i am flower now dear william said she playfully and after all that is great change an he smiled and said he wished he was poetic she was he was poetic in his deeds his young wife often found bunch of fragrant on her pillow when she woke or in her plate when they seated themselves at the he made an arbour her to rest in when they rode out on horseback to visit their future homestead it was shaded with wild vines and an eglantine bush was placed near the entrance filling the whole arbour with the sweet breath of its foliage the first time sibella saw it she looked at him archly and said so you are not jealous of that foolish dream dear william well it is customary to plant flowers on graves and this shall be sacred to the memory of dream ah what bright little cluster of pansies you have planted here that is what you call them in old england said he but in new england we name them ladies delights though some call them your romantic edward preferred the eglantine but 33 34 35 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https is an especial favourite with your practical william i like it because it will grow in all soils bloom at all seasons and hold up its head bravely in all weathers if i were like you i should say it was the efflorescence of yankee character she clapped her hands and exclaimed bravo william you are growing poetic i will name your little favourite the yankee s flower and that will be myself you see i am the yankee s flower she looked into his honest eyes affectionately and added there is one yankee character who is lady s gambolling thus like children and happy in childish pleasures their united lives flowed smoothly on like some full bright unobstructed stream the birth of daughter was like the opening of pure lily on the stream their happiness was now complete their grateful souls asked nothing but continuance of present blessings but alas sudden the rising of thunder cloud deep shadow fell on their sunny prospe william was called away few days on business he left home full of life and love and was brought back shattered corpse he had been killed by an accident in the cars never had sibella known any sorrow approaching the intensity of this sorrow it saddened her to bid farewell to that first which never emer ged out of the mistiness of but this sober certainty of wedded happiness was such living true reality that all her bled when it was wrenched from her so suddenly her suffering soul would have been utterly prostrated by the dreadful blow had it not been the blessed ministration of her babe and the necessity of continuing to labour its future support and education the body of william was buried in pretty little grove on her father s farm and every year the mound was completely covered with fresh bed of ladies delights which his little girl learned to call farder s fower time passed and brought healing on its wings sibella never expected to know happiness again but she had attained to cheerful resignation her little girl of three years lived at the farm under the good grandmother s care she continued to teach in the city spending all her vacations and most of her sundays at the old homestead in her memory lay sunny island covered with pansies and often watered with tears that other island of eglantines had floated far away and had scarcely moonlighted existence but one sunday evening she returned from school she found the little one watching her usual the indulgent grandmother had just given her an eglantine blossom which she had been teazing in her eagerness to bestow something on her mother the child thrust it into her face exclaiming mamma s fower that simple phrase awoke sleeping memories not years had the blooming lanes of old england been so distinctly pictured in the mirror of her soul that night she dreamed edward vernon met her in the prairie and gave her he had gathered the child s exclamation had produced the train of thought of which the dream was born and the dream induced her to look at the verses which had long remained unopened ten years had passed since they were written the paper was worn at the edges and the eglantine blossom was

looked up in her face confidingly with smile but she gazed into his eyes so earnestly that he turned away partly afraid the little girl offered him her flowers and they sat down on the floor to play together it was not long before the farmer entered with the traveler refined looking gentleman apparently about thirty years old the old lady rose to greet him but sibella stooped to gather up the ribbons which had fallen from her trembling hands browned he was by wind and sun she recognized him instantly in fact she had already recognized his eyes and smile in the face of his son she wondered

calling her pleased expression went over vernon s face he replied you did well to name her yourself she resembles you the bud of the eglantine resembles the he spoke thus the ten intervening years

prairie covered with thick carpet of grass and brilliant flowers and dotted with isolated groves like islands charmed him with its novelty of beauty i am perpetually astonished by the profusion and gorgeousness of nature in this region said he he gathered one of the plants at his feet and presenting it to sibella asked whether that glowing blossom was not appropriately named the torch flower what you think of dreams she replied then seeing that he was surprised by the abruptness of the question she told him she had dreamed the night before his arrival that she met him on the prairie and received from his hand he smiled and said its might answer hymen s he looked at her smilingly he spoke he was bolder now than when he wrote the verses seeing the crimson tide mount into her cheeks he touched the flower in her hand and said it blushes more deeply than my old favourite the to relieve her embarrassment sibella began to inquire about barton and her neighbours adding among all these questions i have not yet asked if your sister is she is what the world calls living he replied she has married wealthy old merchant who dresses her in velvet and diamonds and his lady rewards him by treating him with more indifference than she does her footman her acquaintance envy her elegant furniture and costly jewels and when they exclaim how fortunate you are you are surrounded by every

conveniently planned and stood in the midst of natural grove festoons of vines were trained all round it clustering roses climbed up even to the roof and the air was fragrant with eglantines the arbor

men left an orphan in his infancy the paths of life were rough and lonely at the outset he had violent temper and good heart the first was often roused into activity and punished with energy kindred to its own the last remained almost undeveloped want of genial circumstances and reciprocated affection one softening gleam fell upon his early path and he loved it like the sunshine without comprehending the great law of attraction that made it so very pleasant when he attended school in the winter months he always walked home with little girl named mary williams on the ground he was with her always ready to battle with anybody who disobliged her their comrades laughed and called him mary s beau and they blushed and felt awkward though they had idea what court ing meant things had arrived at this state of consciousness he being fourteen years old and mary twelve when her friends removed to the west and the warm bright influence passed out of his life he never rightly knew whether he was in love with mary but years afterwards when people talked to him about marrying he thought of her wondering where she was and whether she remembered him when he drove his cows home from pasture the blackberry bushes on the way brought up visions of his favourite with her clean thrown back her glossy brown hair playing with the winds and her innocent face smiling upon him with friendly greeting she was the best and prettiest child i ever saw he often said to himself i wonder whether she would be pleasant sometimes he thought of going to the west and seeking her out but he knew not where to find her his funds were small and his courage fell at the thought oh it is many years ago since we were children together perhaps i should find her gradually this one ray of poetry faded out of his soul and all his thoughts fell into the common prosaic mould his lot was cast with rough people who required much work and gave little sympathy the image of his little mate floated farther and farther away and more and more seldom her clear blue eyes smiled upon him through the of the past or from the castles of the future in process of time he married after the same fashion that large proportion of men because it was convenient to have wife and there was woman of good character in the neighbourhood willing to marry whoever first offered her respectable home her character bore 47 48 49 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https stamp of harmless mediocrity she was industrious and patient but ignorant dull and quietly obstinate the neighbours said she was well suited to him he was so rough and passionate and in the main he thought so himself though her imperturbable calmness sometimes fretted him rock chafes the lashing ocean into foam the child that was born to them they both loved better than they had ever loved and according to their light they sincerely strove to their duty his bodily wants were well supplied often at the cost of great weariness and but their own rude training had given them few good ideas concerning the culture of an immortal soul the infant did more them than they him angelic influences unseen and unheard amid the hard struggles of their outward life became visible and audibl through the unconscious innocence of their little one the second time in his life vision of beauty and love gleamed across the rugged path of that honest laborious man vague impressions of beauty he had constantly received from the great panorama of the universe his heart sometimes welcomed bright flower in the sunshine or cluster of lilies on the stream he marvelled at the splendor of the rainbow and sometimes gazed reverently at the sun sinking to rest in his rich drapery of purple and gold but these were glimpses of the infinite their beauty did not seem to appertain to him it did not enter like magic charm into the sphere of his own existence did the vision of mary williams and his own little joe the dormant tenderness there was in him leaped up at the smile of his babe and every pressure of the little fingers made dimple in the father s heart like the outbursts of spring after long cold winter was this revelation of infancy to him when he plodded home after hard day s work it rested him body and soul to have the little one spring into his arms kiss or come toddling along tilting his little porringer of milk in eagerness to eat his supper on father s knee but though this new influence seemed to have an almost miraculous power over his nature it could not quite subdue the force of temperament and habit the darling babe grew into boyhood he was sometimes cherished with injudi cious fondness and sometimes repelled by bursts of passion that made him run and hide himself from the father barker had himself been educated under the dispensation of punishment rather than attraction and he believed in it most firmly if his son committed fault he thought of other cure than severity if neighbour did him an ill turn he would observe in presence of the boy i will watch my chance to pay him if the dog stole their dinner when they were at work in the woods he would say run after him joe and give the rascal sound when he saw the child fighting with some larger lad who had offended him he would praise his strength and courage and tell him never to put up with an insult he was not aware that all these thing s were education and doing far more to form his son s character than any thing he learned at school he did not know it because his thoughts had never been directed toward it the only moral instruction he had ever received had been from the minister of the parish and he usually preached about the hardheartedness of jews two thousand years ago rather than the errors and temptations of men and boys who sat before him once he received an admonition from his neighbour goodwin which being novel and unexpected offended him an impert inent interference with his rights he was riding home with joe then lad of thirteen when the horse took fright at piece of white paper that the wind blew across the road barker was previously in an ill humor because sudden squall of rain had wet some fine hay all ready the barn pursuing the system on which he had himself been educated he sprang to the ground and cudgelled the poor beast unmercifully goodwin who was passing by inquired the cause of so much severi ty and remonstrated against it assuring him that horse was never cured of bad habits by violence he spoke mildly but barker was irritated and having told him to mind his own business he continued to whip the poor frightened animal the humane neighbour turned away saying that is bad lesson your son mr barker if you say much more i will flog you instead of the horse muttered the angry man it is nt his horse what business is it to him he added turning to his son he did not reflect in what narrow circuit he was nailing up the sympathies of his child by such words those but when he was reseated in the wagon he did not feel altogether pleased with himself and his inward uneasiness was expended on the horse the poor bewildered animal covered with foam and breathing short and hard tried his utmost to his master s will far he could understand it but nervous and terrified constantly in expectation of the whip he started at every sound if he went too fast he was reined in with sudden jerk that tore the corners of his mouth if he went too slow the cruel crack of the whip made him tear over the ground to be again restrained by the violent jerk 50 51 52 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https sun was setting and threw radiant glow on every tree and little shrub jewelled by the recent shower cows grazed peacefully in verdant hollows birds sang little brook rippled cosily by the wayside winds played gently with the flowers and kissed the raindrops from their faces but all this loveliness passed unheeded by those human hearts because they had at the moment inward beauty to harmonize with nature perhaps the familiar landscape seemed quite otherwise to the poor horse than it would have done had he travelled along those pleasant paths guided by wise and gentle hand had joseph continued to be little joe his eager welcome and loving prattle might soon have tamed the evil spirit in his father s soul that night but he was tall lad who had learned to double up his fists and tell other boys they had better let him alone if they knew what was good themselves he still loved his father better than any thing else in the world but the charm and the power of infancy were gone he reflected back the vexed spirit like too faithf ul mirror he was longer transparent unconscious medium the influence of angels indeed paternal affection gradually became hardening rather than softening influence ambition his son increased the love of accumulation and the gratificatio n of this propensity narrowed his sympathies more and more joseph had within him the unexpan ded germs of some noble qualities but he inherited his father s passionate temperament with his moth er s obstinacy and the education of such circumstance s i have described turned his energies and feelings into wrong channels the remark it is nt his horse what business is it to him heard in his boyhood expressed the views and habits of his later years but his mental growth such it was pleased his father who often said exultingly ther is danger of joe he knows how to fight his own way through the such was their mutual product of character when barker was summoned to jury in case involving life or death he was vexed to be called away from his employments and had never reflected at all upon the fearful responsibility of juryman james lloyd the prisoner was very young man and his open honest countenance gave indication of capacity crime but he was accused of murder and circumstantial evidence was strong against him it was proved that previous quarrel had existed between him and the murdered man and that they had been seen to take the same road the prisoner in state of intoxication the night the violent deed was committed most people thought there was doubt of his guilt others deemed the case by means certain two of the jury were reluctant to convict him and wished to find the evidence insuf ficient the penalty was so dreadful and their feelings were so much touched by the settled misery of his youthful countenance others talked sternly of justice and urged that the scripture demanded blood blood of this number was peter barker from the beginning he was against the prisoner the lawyer who pleaded him had once been employed in against barker and had gained the cause his client the juryman cherished grudge against him his sarcastic eloquence on that occasion moreover it so happened that neighbour goodwin who years ago had reproved his severity to the horse took compassionate interest in the accused he often consulted with his lawyer and seemed to watch the countenances of the jury anxiously it was busy season of the year and the jury were impatient to be at their workshops and farms barker would not have admitted it even to himself but all these circumstances helped to increase his hardness against the prisoner by such inconceivably slight motives is the conduct of men often swayed on the most important occasions if the poor young fellow really did commit the act said one of the jury it seems likely that he did it in state of intoxication i was once drunk myself and they told afterward that i had quarrelled with man and knocked him down high flight of steps but i had recollection of it if i had killed him and they had hung it what an awful thing it would have been my poor father and mother it taught good lesson i was never again intoxicated perhaps this poor youth might profit by his dreadful experience if chance were allowed him he is so young and there is nothing bad in his his womanly face replied barker there is trusting to that the worst villains are not always the his being intoxicated there is telling whether it is true or not that cunning lawyer may have made up the story the sake of exciting compassion and the witnesses may be more than willing enough to believe every thing strange in the prisoner s conduct was the result of intoxication moreover it won t to admit that plea in extenuation then don t you see man who wants to kill his enemy has only to get drunk in the first place if anybody killed my joe drunk or not drunk i should want him to swing 53 54 55 56 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https such remarks urged in his vehement way he swayed minds more timid and lenient than his own without being fully aware of what he was doing he was foreman of the jury and when the awful moment arrived on which depe nded the life of fellow being he pronounced the word guilty in strong firm voice the next instant his eye fell on the prisoner standing there so pale and still looking at him with such fixed despair there was something in the face that moved him strongly he turned quickly away but the vision was before him always and everywhere before him this is weakness he said to himself i have merely done my duty the law required it i have done my but still the pale young face looked at him always and everywhere it looked at him he feared to touch newspaper he wished not to know when the day of execution would arrive but officious neighbours ignorant of his state of mind were eager to talk upon the subject and when drawn into such discourse he strove to fortify his own feelings by dwelling on all the worst circumstances of the case notwi thstanding all his efforts the night preceding the execution he had troubled dreams in which that ghastly young face was always conspicuous when he woke he saw it in the air it walked beside him he ploughed the fields it stood before him on the threshold of his own door all that the merciful juryman had suggested came before him with painful distinctness could there be doubt that the condemned had really committed murder was he intoxicated might he have happened to be intoxicated the first time in his life and he so young but he drove these thoughts away saying ever to himself the law required it i merely did my still every thing looked gloomy to him the evening clouds seemed like funeral palls and pale despairing face gazed at him forever the first time in his manhood he craved companion in the darkness neighbours came in and described the execution and while they talked the agitated juryman beat the into thousand pieces and spoke never word they told how the youth had written long letter to his mother and had died calm and resigned by the way perhaps you knew his mother barker said one they tell she used to live in this neighbourhood you rememb er girl by the name of mary williams the tongs dropped from barker s hand he gasped out mary williams was he her son god give was he her son and the strong man laid his head upon the table and wept there was silence in the room at last the loquacious neighbour said in subd ued tone i am sorry i hurt your feelings i didn t know she was friend of the troubled juryman rose hastily walked to the window looked out at the stars and clearing his choked voice said it is many years since i knew her but she was pretty girl and it seems but yesterday that we used to go together to pick our baskets full of berries and so she was his mother i remember now there was something in his eye that seemed familiar to perhaps the mention of mary s beauty or the melting mood so unusual with her husband might have excited vague feeling of jealousy in barker whatever might have been the motive she said in her demure way without raising her eyes from her knitting well it was natural enough to suppose the young man had mother and other mothers are likely to have hearts that can feel well this mary he only answered by shaking his head slowly and repeating if to himself poor mary and so he was her joseph came in and the details of the dreadful scene were repeated and dwelt upon human beings are prone to dwell on all that excites strong emotion to him the name of mary williams conjured up smiling visions of juvenile love and he strove to fortify his father s relenting feelings by placing in strong light all the arguments in favour of the prisoner s guilt the juryman was glad to be thus fortified and replied in firm reassured voice at all events i did my yet months after the pale young face looked at him despairingly from the evening air and came between him and the sunshine but time which softens all things drifted the dreary spectre into dim distance and mr barker s faculties were again completely absorbed in making money his son joseph was called fine promising young man but his conduct was not altoge ther satisfactory to his parents he was fond of dress and company and his impetuous temperam ent not unfrequently involved him in quarrels on two or three of these occasions they feared he had been little excited by drink but he was in reality fellow and like his rough father had undeveloped germs of deep tenderness within him his father s life was bound up within his his mother loved 57 58 59 60 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https with all the energy of which her sluggish nature was capable and notwithstanding the inequalities of his violent and capricious temper the neighbours loved him also what then was their consternation when it was rumoured that on his he had been arrested murder and alas it was too true that his passions had thus far mastered his reason he wished to please young girl in the vicinity and she treated him coolly because rival had informed her that he was seen intoxicated and in that state had spoken boldly of being sure of her love he drank again to drown his vexation and while the excitement of the draught was on him he met the man who informed against him his exulting rival was injudicious enough to exclaim ho here you are drunk again what promising fellow husband unfortunately an axe was at hand and in the double fury of drink and rage he struck with it again and again one hour after he would have given all he ever hoped to possess nay he would gladly have died could he have restored the life he had so wantonly destroyed thus barker was again brought into court of justice on an affair of life and death how differently all questions connected with the subject presented themselves now he sat beside that darling son the pride of his life his only hope on earth oh how he longed words of fire to plead that his young existence might be spared repentance and amendment how well he remembered the juryman s plea youth and intoxication and with what an agony of he recalled his own hard answer with intense anxiety he watched the countenance of the jury some gleams of compassion but ever and anon pale young face loomed up between him and them and gazed at him with fixed despair the vision of other years returned to haunt him and joseph his best beloved his only one stood beside it pale and handcuf fed he had been the voice that pronounced his son guilty sounded like an awful echo of his own and he seemed to hear mary williams whisper and my son also was very that vigorous from his own existence so full of life and feeling and alas of passion which misguides us must die earthly power can save him may the all m erciful sustain that poor father he watches the heavy slumber of his only son in that dark prison and while he clasps the cold hand remembers so well the dimpled fingers he used to hold in his when little joe sat upon his knee and prattled childish love and the all m erciful was with him and sent influences to sustain him through that terrible agony it did not break his heart it melted and subdued him the congealed sympathies of his nature flowed under this ordeal of fire and the first time he had realizing sense that every human being is or has been somebody s little joe how kind you are to said the prisoner in answer to his soothing words and affectionate attentions he replied meekly would i had always been so then turning his face away and earnestly pressing joseph s hand he said in an agitated voice tell truly my son does it ever occur to you that i may have been to blame this great misfortune that has befallen you you dear father he exclaimed i not understand what you still keeping his face turned away and speaking with effort barker said you remember once when i was beating my horse cruelly you were boy of twelve then neighbour goodwin remarked to that i was giving bad lesson to my son i was angry with him at the time and perhaps that resentment helped to make hard toward poor young fellow who is dead and gone but his words keep ringing in my ears now may god in his mercy forgive if i have ever done or said any thing to lead you into this great sin tell joseph you ever think it might have happened otherwise if you had had less violent father my poor father exclaimed the prison er press ing his hand convulsively it almost breaks my heart to hear you thus humble yourself before who so little deserve it at your hands only forgive my violent outbreaks dear father in the midst of them all i always loved you you have always sought to good and would rather have died than have led into any harm but since i have been here in prison i have thought of many things that never occurred to before the world and all things in it are placed before in different light it seems to men are all wrong in their habits and teachings i see now that retaliation and hatred are murder i have read often of late the exhortation of jesus to forgive our brother his offences not only seven times but seventy times seven and i feel that thus it ought to be with human beings in all their relations with each other what i have done can not be undone but if it will be any satisfaction to you rest assured 61 62 63 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https i did not intend to kill him i was wretched and i was fool enough to drink and then i knew not what i did violent my temper has been i never conceived the thought of taking his i know it my son i know it he said and that reflection consoles in some degree while i have loaf of bread i will share it with the mother and sister of him he hesitated shuddered and added in low deep you murdered i was going to ask that of you replied the prisoner and one thing more dear father try to bear up bravely under this terrible blow the sake of my poor patient mother i will i will he answered and now my dear misguided boy say you forgive your poor father the teachings of his violent words and actions i did not foresee the consequences my child i did it in my ignorance but it was wrong wrong all the young man threw himself on his father s bosom and they had other utterance but tears after his only strong link to life was broken by the violent arm of the law barker was changed man silent and melancholy patient gentle and forgiving to all he never complained of the great sorrow that wasted away his life but the neighbours saw how thin and sad he looked and the roughest natures felt compassion him every year she who had been mary williams received hundred dollar note he never whispered to any mortal that it was sent by the juryman who helped to condemn her son to death but when he died legacy of thousand dollars to her showed that he

are fairies fancy in her oddest freaks never paints any thing which has existence she merely puts invisible agencies into visible forms and embodies spiritual influences in material facts it seems wild fiction when we read of beautiful young maidens floating in gossamer and radiant with jewels who suddenly change into mocking old hags or jump off into some slimy pool in the form of frog or like the fair melusina doomed to become fish on certain days of the year and those who happened to see her in that plight could never again see her the fair melusina yet who that has grown from youth to manhood who that has been in love and out of love has not found the fairies of his life playing him just such tricks in the fascinating ballet of giselle so poetic in conception and so gracefully expressed in music there is deep and tender meaning all who have lived long or lived much is not memory fairy spirit like giselle dancing round graves hovering between us and the stars flitting across our woodland rambles throwing us garlands and from the past coming to us in dreams so real that we clasp our loved ones and gliding away when morning gleams on the material world oh yes there are fairies both good and bad and they are with us according we obey or disobey their laws of being one with whom i made acquaintance soon i could run alone has visited ever since though sometimes she pouts and hides herself and will not soon come back i am always sad when she is gone she is wonder little sprite and she takes all my wealth away with her if you were to gaze on field of dandelions if she were not at your elbow you would merely think they were pretty posies and would make excellent greens dinner but if she touches you and renders you clairvoyant they will surprise you with their golden beauty and every blossom will radiate halo sometimes she fills the whole air with rainbow s if nature were out dance with all her ribbons on sup of water taken from little brook in the hollow of her hand has made more merry than would goblet of wine she has often filled my apron with opals emeralds and sapphires and i was never weary of looking at them but those who had 64 65 66 67 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https away from the fairy and forgotten her treasures sneered at my joy and said fie upon thee wilt thou always be child they are nothing but last spring my friendly little one guided to silver waterfall at weehawken where group of german were sitting with their feet in the water their little blue eyes laughed when they saw i asked what made them smile in my face so lovin gly they answered because we hear pleasant song and you know what it says to it was not i who knew it was the fairy but she had magnetized and so i heard all that was said to her wealthy invalid passed by afflicted with dyspepsia he did not see the flowers smile or hear the waterfall singing his flowing melody of love to the blue eyes that made his home so beautiful he had parted from the fairy long ago he told her she was fool and that none would ever grow rich who suffered themselves to be led by her she laughed and said thou dost not know that i alone am rich always and every where rich but go thy ways vain worldling shouldst thou come back to i will ask if thou hast ever found any thing equal to my gems and she gazed after him moment and laughed again she exclaimed aha let him try the gay little spirit spoke truly indeed there is nothing so real her unrealities those who have parted from her complain that she made them large promises in their early time and has never kept them but to those who remain with her trustfully she more than fulfils all them she covers the rock with gold and fills the wintry air with diamonds it is many years since she first began to tell her fine stories but this very last new year s day she led out into the country and lighted up all the landscape i went so that it seemed lovelier than the rarest pictures the round bright face of the moon smiled at and said i know thee well thou hast built many castles up here come to them whenever thou wilt their drapery with rainbow fringes is more real than silken festoons in broadway i was glad at heart and i said to my fairy the sherif f can not attach our furniture or sell our castles at indeed she replied he can not even see them he has forgotten he thinks all the gems i show are only pebbles and all my prismatic mantles mere this simple little sprite says much richer things than the miracles she does her talk is all alive she is poet though she knows it not or rather because she knows it not she tells the odde st and most brilliant things and sometimes i write them down imperfectly well i can remember them matter persons shake their heads and say what on earth does the woman mean i never see and hear such and grave people raise their spectacles and inquire can you point out any moral or any use in all this stuff there is sense in it says one the writer is insane says another she s an enthus iast but we must pardon that weakness says third more magnanimous than others the fairy and i have great fun together while we listen to their jokes and apologies the frolicsome little witch knows very well that it is she who says the things that puzzle them and she knows the meaning very well but she never tells it to those who speer

would write verses during whole day and night with untiring rapidity scarcely pausing to eat or to rest his hand in the poems which expressed his own inward life there was often something above common comprehension but in addition to those higher efforts he wrote great number of verses the peasantry in all the peculiar dialects of their various districts the merest trifle that flowed from his pen is said to have contained some sparkling fancy or some breathing of sentiments truly poetic he was an impassioned lover of nature and in his descriptions of natural objects was peculiar making them seem alive thus in one of his poems he describes the winds coming through clefts of rock forming powerful current in the fiord driving waves before them like flock of huge lawyer who passes through the current in boat imagines the great waves to be angry spectres of the many poor clients whom he has wronged he throws one ten dollars another twenty another fifty to pacify them at last wondrous

old hermit with long beard and various other grotesque figures carved in wood the grotto was occasionally lighted up in the evening and the images seen among flickering shadows excited great awe in the minds of peasant children this gifted and genial man who lived in such loving companionship with nature was called away from the earth which seemed to him so cheerful before he had passed the

to the scenery of germany among the ruins karl schelling poor working peasant made himself home with him dwelt his good wife liesbet and two eyed children named fritz and gretchen few cooking utensils and wooden stools constituted all their furniture and one goat was all they had to remind them of flocks and herds but these poor children led happier life than those small imitations of human ity who are bred up 78 79 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https city palaces and drilled to walk through existence in languid paces from grown arches in the old ruins they could watch boats and vessels gliding over the sparkling rhine and see broad meadows golden with sunshine on the terrace of the castle the wind had planted many flowers it was richly carpeted with various kinds of moss tufts of grass and little pinks here karl often carried his goat to feed and left the children to tend upon him there had been stork s nest on the roof from time immemorial and the little ones were early taught to reverence the birds omens of blessing their simple young souls were quite unconscious of poverty the splendid rhine with all its broad with herds peacefully nestling among wood y seemed to belong to them and in reality they possessed them more truly than many rich man who one moment gazes on his flowers the next they are got and eateth of his rarest fruits though he ate them on their little heaps of straw brother and sister slept soundly in each other s arms and if the hooting of an owl chanced to wake them some bright star looked in with friendly eye through chinks in the walls and said go to sleep little ones all little children are dear to the good thus with scanty food and coarse clothes plenty of pure air and blue sky fritz and his sister went hand in hand over their rugged but flower path of life till he was nearly seven years old then came uncle heinrich his mother s brother and said the boy could be useful to him at the mill where he worked and if the parents were willing to bind him to his service he would supply him with food and clothing and give him an outfit when he came of age tears were in liesbet s eyes she thought how lonely it would seem to her and little gretchen when they should longer hear fritz mocking the birds or singing aloud to the high heaven but they were very poor and the child must earn his bread so with much sorrow to part with father and mother and gretchen the goat and the stork and with some gladness to go to new scenes fritz departed from the old nest that had served him home mounted with uncle heinrich on the miller s donkey he ambled along through rocky paths by deep ravines and hills with here and there glimpses of the noble river flowing on bright and strong reflecting images of spires cottages and slopes when he arrived at his new home the good grandmother gave him right friendly welcome and promised to set up on her striped blue cap him to wear uncle heinrich was kind in his rough way but he thought it an excellent plan boys to eat little and work hard fritz remembering the of the old castle was always delighted to spy clump of flowers his uncle told him they looked well enough but he wondered anybody should ever plant them since they were not useful either to eat or wear and that when he grew older he would doubtless think more of pence than posies thus the child began to be ashamed of something wrong when he was caught digging flower but his laborious and economical relative taught him many orderly and thrifty ways which afterward had great influence on his success in life and fortunately love the beautiful could not be pressed out of him kind nature took him in her arms and whispered many things to preserve him from becoming mere animal all day long he was hard at work but the blossoming tree was his friend and the bright little stream chatted cozily and smiled when the good grandmother gave it his clothes to the miller s donkey ambling along through paths over the hills was picture to him from his small garret window he could see the scattering bright drops in the moonlight and he fell asleep to the gentle lullaby of ever water other education than this he had not his only teachers had been woods and rills the silence that is in the starry sky the sleep that is among the lonely an aged neighbour cotemporary with the grandmother took great liking to fritz and on sundays when work could be done he was often allowed to go and take dinner or supper there the old man had traversed nearly all germany peddler and had come to die in the old homestead near the mill where he had worked when boy he knew by heart all the wild fairy legends of the country and in his character of peddler had acquired talent relating them 80 81 82 83 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https manner peculiarly amusing and exciting to children in the course of his travels he had likewise collected many things which seemed very remarkable to the inexperienced eye of fritz such curious and s and images in all the various costum es of germany but what most attracted his attention was an ancient clock brought from copenhagen when the peddler s father was young man when this clock was in its right mind it could play twelve tunes about simple molly put the kettle but the friction of many years had so worn the cogs of the wheels that it was frightfully out of tune this did not trouble the boy s strong nerves and he was prodigiously amused with the sputtering seething jumping jabbering sounds it made when set in motion to each of the crazy old tunes he gave some droll name there goes the spitting cat he would say now let us hear the old father rudolph called the rickety old machine his blacking box because he had boug ht it with the proceeds of peculiar kind of blacking of his own manufacture he was always praising this blacking and one day he said i have never told any one the secret of makin g it but if you are good boy fritz i will show you how it is the child could not otherwise than respect what had procured such wonderful clock and when he fell asleep that night there floated through his mind undefined visions of being able some time or other to purchase such comical machine himself this seemed very unimportant incident of his childhood but it was the introduction of thread that reappeared again in his web of life fritz passed at the old mill four years of health happiness and hard labor three years father rudolph was an unfailing source of entertainment alternately with his comic old songs and wild legends of fairies and goblins he imparted much of traveller s discursive observation and thorough practical knowledge concernin g the glossy jet blacking at last he fell asleep and the boy heard that pleasant old voice more except in the echoing caves of memory the good grandmother survived the companion of her youth only few months the ancient ballads she used to croon at her had caught something of the monotonous flow of the water which forever accompanied them and fritz he passed up and down from the mill to the brook missed the quaint old melo dies he would have missed the rustling of the leaves the chirping of crickets or any other dear old familiar sound he missed too her kind motherly ways and the little comforts with which her care supplied him with the exception of his rough but really uncle he was now alone in the world he had visited r√ºdesheim but once and had then greatly amused gretchen with his imitations of the crazy clock but his parents had since removed to remote district and he knew not when he should see dear gretchen again none of them could read or write there came tidings to cheer the long years of separation how his heart yearned at times the good mother and the joyous little sister but when uncle heinrich announced his intention of removing to america the prospect of new adventures and the youthful tendency to look on the bright side of things overbalanced the pain of parting from father it is true the last night he slept at the old mill the moonlight had farewell sadness in its glance and the little stream murmured more plaintively it flowed fritz thought perhaps they knew he was going away they certainly seemed to sigh forth we shall see thee more thou bright strong child we remain but thou art passing away when the emigrants came to the every thing was new and exciting to the juvenile imagination of fritz the ships out in the harbor looked like great white birds sailing through the air how pleasant it must be thus to glide over the wide waters but between ship in the distance and the ship we are in there exists the usual difference between the ideal and the actual there was little romance in the crowded cabin with hundreds of poor emigrants eating drinking and smoking amid the odour of and the dreadful nausea of the sea poor fritz longed the pure atmosphere and brook at the mill however there was always america in prospect painted to his imagination like islands of the blest uncle heinrich said he should grow rich there and fairy whispered in his ear that he himself might one day possess copenhagen clock bright and new that would play its tunes decently and in order said fritz to the fairy i had rather buy father rudolph s clock it was such funny old very well replied the fairy be diligent and saving and perhaps i will one day bring father rudolph s clock to crow and sputter to thee in the new but these golden dreams of the future received sad check one day there was cry of man overboard it occasioned the more terror because shark had been following in the wake of the vessel several days boats were lowered instantly but crimson tinge on the surface of the water showed that their efforts were useless it was not till some minutes after the confusion subsided that 84 85 86 87 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https perceived his uncle heinrich was missing terrible had been that crimson stain on the water but now when he knew it was the of his last and only friend it made him faint and dizzy if it were flowing from his own veins uncle heinrich s savings were fastened within the belt he wore and bundle of coarse clothes with few tools were all that remained of his worldly possessions the captain had compassion on the desolate child and charged nothing his passage or his food when the vessel came within sight of port the passengers though most of them poor raised small fund him by contribution but who can describe the utter loneliness of the emigrant boy when he parted from his and wandered through the crowded streets of new york without meeting single face he had ever seen before lights shone in cheerful basements where families supped together but his mother and his dear little were they oh it was very sad to be so entirely alone in such wide wide world sometimes he saw boy turn round to stare at his queer little cap and outlandi sh frock but he could not understand what he said when he sung out there goes what they call flying day after day he tried work but could obtain none his funds were running very low and his heart was extremely heavy he stood leaning against post one day goat walked slowly towards him from neighboring court how his heart leaped up to greet her with her came back images of the castle on the rhine the blooming terrace his kind father his blessed mother and his darling little sister he patted the goat s head and kissed her and looked deep into her eyes he had done with the companion of his boyhood stranger came to lead the animal away and when she was gone poor fritz sobbed if his heart would break i have not even goat friend now thought he i wish i could get back to the old mill again i am afraid i shall starve here in this foreign land where there is nobody to bury in the midst of these gloomy cogitations there was an alarm of fire and the watchmen sprung their rattles instantly ray of hope darted through his soul the sound reminded him of father rudolph s blacking box one of its tipsy tunes began with flourish exactly like it i will save every cent i can and buy materials to make blacking thought he i will sleep under the planks on the wharves and live on two pence day i can speak few words of english i will learn more from some of my countrymen who have been here longer than then perhaps i can sell blacking enough to buy bread and and thus he did at first it went very hard with him some days he earned nothing and week of patient waiting brought but one shilling but his broad face was so clean and honest his manners so respectful and his blacking so uncommonly good that his customers gradually increased one day gentleman who traded with him made mistake and gave him shilling instead of piece fritz did not observe it at the moment but the next day when the gentleman passed to his he followed him and touched him on the arm the merchant inquired what he wanted fritz showed the coin saying dat not neither is it mine rejoined the merchant what you show it to the boy replied in his imperfect english dat too friend who was with the merchant addressed him in german and the poor emigrant s countenance lighted up if it had become suddenly transparent and lamp placed within it heaving sigh and blushing at his own emotion he explained in his native tongue that he had accidently taken too much his blacking the day before they looked at him with right friendly glances and inquired into his history he told them his name and parentage and how uncle heinrich had attempted to bring him to america and had been devoured by shark on the way he said he had not single friend in this foreign land but he meant to be honest and industrious and he hoped he should well the gentlemen assured him that they should always remember him fritz shilling and that they would certainly speak of him to their friends he did not understand the joke of his name but he did understand that they bought all his blacking and that customers increased more rapidly after that interview it would be tedious to follow the emigrant through all the process of his fortune soon he could spare anything from necessary food and clothing he went to an evening school where he learned to read write and cipher he became first then clerk and finally established neat himself through all these changes he continued to sell the blacking which arrived at the honour of poetical advertisements in the newspapers under the name of schelling s best boot polisher but the prosperity thus produced was not the only result of his acquaintance with father rudolph the dropped stitches of our life are sometimes taken up again strangely through many intervening loops one day fritz was passing through the streets when he was about sixteen 88 89 90 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https old he stopped and listened intently he heard far off the sounds of popular german ballad which his grandmother and the peddler often used to sing together through all the din and rattle of the streets he could plainly distinguish the monotonous minor cadence which had often brought tears to his eyes when boy he followed the tones and soon came in sight of an old man and his wife singing the familiar melody maiden apparently somewhat younger than himself played tamborin at intervals when he spoke to her in german her face kindled his own had done at the first sound of his native tongue in strange land they call r√∂schen she replied these are my father and mother we came from the ship last night and we sing bread till we can get work to the soul looked simply and kindly through her blue eyes and reminded him of sister gretchen her wooden shoes short blue petticoat and little crimson jacke t might seem vulgar to the fashionable and picturesque to the artist but to him it was merely the beloved costume of his native land it warmed his heart with childish recollections and when they sang again the quaint sad melody he seemed to hear the old brook flow plaintively by and see the farewell moonlight on the mill thus began his acquaintance with the maiden who was afterwards his wife and the mother of his little gretchen of these and all other groups of emigra nts many years he inquired concerning his parents and his sister but could obtain tidings at last priest in germany to whom he wrote replied that gretchen had died in childhood and that the father and mother had also recently died it was great disappointment to the affectionate heart of fritz schelling through all his expanding fortunes he had cherished the hope of returning to them or bringing them to share his comfortable home in the new world but when he received the mournful news he had r√∂schen to love and her parents to care and little one that twined herself round his heart with fresh flower every day at he was happy and prosperous man so prosperous that he could afford to live well in the city and yet build himself snug cottage in the country we can go out every saturday and return on monday said he to r√∂schen we can have fresh cream and our own sweet butter it will the children good to roll on the grass and they shall have goat to play and perhaps we can go there to live all the time rejoined r√∂schen it is so quiet and pleasant in the country and what s the use of being richer than enough the site chosen the cottage overlooked the broad bright river where high palisades of rock seemed almost like the ruins of an old castle fritz said he would make flower on the rocks the goat to browse upon and if stork would only come and build nest on his thatched roof he could almost fancy himself in germany at times the idea of importing storks crossed his mind but his good sense immediately rejected the plan it is difficult to imagine how those venerable birds with their love of the antique and the unchangeable could possibly live in america one might well try to import loyal subjects or an ancient nobility when house and barn were completed the first object was to secure honest industrious german tenants to till the soil fritz heard of company of emigrants who wished to sell themselves specified time in order to pay their passage and he went on board the ship to see them hale man who said he was about sixty years old with wife some five or six years younger attracted his attention by their extreme cleanliness and good expression of countenance he soon agreed to purchase them and in order to prepare the necessary papers he inquired their names karl schelling and liesbet schelling replied the old man fritz started and his face flushed he asked did you ever live in the old castle at r√ºdesheim that we did several summers rejoined karl ah can you tell us any thing of our son fritz exclaimed liesbet eyeing him eagerly god bless him wherever he is we came to america to find mother mother you not know he said and threw himself into her open arms and kissed the honest weather face i see it has gone well with you my son now thanks be to god and blessed be his holy name said karl reverently uncovering his head and where is gretchen inquired fritz earnestly the took her home to himself soon after you came to see us at r√ºdesheim replied liesbet she was always mourn ing the brother poor little one it troubled us to go away 91 92 93 94 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https leave you behind us without saying farewell and i feared blessing would follow it but we were very poor and we thought then we should come to you in two or three don t speak of that said fritz you were always good parents to and did the best you could blessings have followed and to meet you thus is the crowning blessing of all come let us hasten home i want to show you my good r√∂schen and our gretchen and karl and liesbet and rudolph and baby r√∂schen my small farm overlooks river broad and beautiful the rhine the rocks look like castles and i have bought goat the children to play with the roof of our cottage is thatched and if stork would only come and build her nest there then dear father and mother might almost imagine themselves again at r√ºdesheim with plenty to eat drink and wear if father rudolph s blacking box were only here added he laughing i should have all but one of my boyish dreams fulfilled ah if dear gretchen were only here the fairy who whispered to fritz when he was crossing the atlantic told him if he were diligent and saving she would perhaps bring him the old clock and she kept her promi better than fairies sometimes it chanced that the heir of father rudolph came to america and brought it with him the price fritz offered it was too tempting and it now stands in his thatched cottage its carved black case inlaid with grotesque figures of birds and beasts in pearl is more wonderful than to the children when any of them are out of health or out of humour their father sets the old bewildered tunes agoing and they soon join in merry mocking chorus with cluck cluck cluck whirr whirr whirr rik

road winding under the shade of large elm stood small house it was humble building and the little belfry on the top seemed hardly large enough the motions of the suspended there but it was picturesque feature in the landscape the elm drooped over it with uncommon gracef ulness and almost touched the belfry with its light foliage the weather shing les were relief to the eye of the traveller weary of prim staring white houses moreover human soul had inscribed on the little place pastoral poem in vines and flowers white rose bush covered half one side and carried its offering of blossoms up to the little bell cypress vines were trained to meet over the door in gothic arch surmounted by cross on the western side the window was shaded with profusion of morning glories and great rock that jutted out into the road was thickly strewn with iceland moss which in the springtime covered it with carpet of yellow stars it was at that season it was first seen by geor ge franklin young new york lawyer on visit to the country he walked slowly past gazing at the noble elm slightly waving its young foliage to gentle breeze just then out poured flock of children of various ages jumping and laughing they joined hands and formed circle round the elm clear voice was heard within the singing lively time while measured strokes on some instrument of tin marked the time the little band whirled round the tree stepping to the music with the rude grace of childhood and joy after ten or fifteen minutes of this healthy exercise they stopped apparently in obedience to some signal half of them held their hands aloft and formed arches the other half to jump through then they described swift circles with their arms and leaped high in the air having gone through their simple code of gymnastics away they scampere d to seek pleasure after their own fashion till summoned to their books again some of them bowed and courtesied to the traveller they passed while others with arms round each other s necks went hopping along first on one foot then on the other too busy to more than nod and smile they went by many of them wore patched garments but hands and faces were all clean some had stolid animal look but even these seemed to sun their 95 96 97 98 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https nature in the rays of beauty and freedom which they found only at school the whole scene impressed the young man very vividly he asked himself why it could not be always thus in the family in the school every where why need man forever be blot on natu re why must he be coarse and squalid and gross and heavy while nature is ever radiant with fresh beauty and joyful with her overplus of life then came saddening thoughts how other influences of life coarse parents selfish employers and the hard struggle daily bread would overshadow the genial influences of that pleasant school which few months gilded the lives of those little ones when he repassed the spot some hours after all was still save the occasional twittering of birds in the tree it was sunset and bright farewell gleam shone across the on the rock and made the little flowers in the garden smile when he returned to the city the scene often rose before his mind lovely picture and he longed the artist s skill to it visibly in its rustic beauty when he again visited the country after midsummer he remembered the little old house and one of his earliest excursions was walk in that direction profus ion of crimson stars and white stars now peeped out from the fringed foliage of the cypress vines and the little front yard was one bed of blossoms he leaned over the gate and observed how neatly every plant was trained if some loving hand tended them carefully every day he listened but could hear voices and curiosity impelled him to see how the little building looked within he lifted the latch peeped in and saw that the room was empty the rude benches and the walls were perfectly clean the windows were open on both sides and the air was redolent with the sweet breath of mignonette on the teacher s desk was small vase of grecian pattern containing few flowers tastefully arranged some books lay beside it and one had an ivory folder between the leaves if recently used it was bettin s letters to g√ºnderode and where it opened at the ivory folder he read these lines enclosed in pencil

over the budding reverence have i before the destiny of each child shut up in so sweet bud one feels reverence at touching young bud which the spring is swelling the young man smiled with pleased surprise he had not expected to find appreciation of such sentiments in the teacher of seclu ded country school he took up volum of mary howitt s birds and flowers and saw the name of alice white written in it on all blank spaces were fastened delicate young fern leaves and small bits of moss he glanced at the low ceiling and the rude benches this seems not the appropriate temple such spirit thought he but after all what consequence is that since such spirits find temples everywhere he took pencil from his pocket and marked in bettine s letters thou hast feeling the life of nature dawn and evening clouds are thy dear companions with whom thou canst converse when man is abroad with thee let be thy scholar in simplicity he wrote his initials on the page perha ps i shall never see this young teacher thought he but it will be little mystery in her unexciting life to conjecture what curious eye has been peeping into her then he queried with himself how i know she is young teacher he stood leaning against the window looking on the beds of flowers and the vine leaves brushed his hair the breeze played with them they seemed to say that young heart planted them he remembered the clear feminine voice he had heard humming the in the spring time he thought of the mosses and ferns in the book oh yes she must be young and beautiful thought he she can not be otherwise than beautiful with such he stood some moments in half dreaming reverie then broad smile went over his face he was making fun of himself what consequence is it to whether she be either beautiful or young said he inwardly i must be hungry an adventure to indulge so much curiosity about country the smile was still on his face when he heard light step and alice white stood before him she blushed to see stranger in her little sanctuary and he blushed at the awkwardness of his situation he apologized by saying that the beauty of the little garden and the tasteful arrangement of the vines had attracted his attention and perceiving that the was empty he had taken the liberty to enter she readily forgave the intrusion and said she was glad if the humble little spot refreshed the eyes of those who passed by it had given her great pleasure to cultivate it the young man was disappointed she was not at all like the picture his imaginat ion had painted but 99 100 101 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https tones of her voice were flexible and there was something pleasing in her quiet but timid manner not knowing what to say he bowed and took leave several days after when his rural visit was drawing to close he felt the need of long walk and pleasant vision of the winding road and the little rose before him he did not even think of alice white he was ambitious and had well nigh resolved never to marry except to advance his fortunes he admitted to himself that grace and beauty might easily bewitch him and turn him from his prudent purpose but the poor country teacher was not beautiful either in face or figure he had thought of her but to vary his route somewhat he passed through the woods and there he found her gathering mosses by little brook she recognized him and he stopped to help her gather mosses thus it happened that they fell into discourse together and the more he listened the more he was surprised to find so rare jewel in so plain setting her thoughts were so fresh and were so simply said and now he noticed deep expression in her eye imparting more elevated beauty than is ever derived from form or colour he could not define it to himself still less to others but she charmed him he lingered by her side and when they parted at the gate he was half in hopes she would invite him to enter i expect to visit this town again in the autumn he said may i hope to find you at the little she did not say whether he might hope to find her there but she answered with smile i am always here i have adopted it my home and tried to make it pleasant one since i have other all the way home his thoughts were occupied with her and the memory of her simple pleasant ways often recurred to him amid the noises of the city he would easily have forgotten her in that stage of their acquaintance had any beautiful heiress happened to cross his path though his nature was kindly and had touch of romance ambition was the predominant trait in his character but it chanced that woman attracted him very powerfully before he again found himself on the winding road where stood the picture sque little then came frequent walks and confidential interviews which revealed more loveliness of mind and character than he had previously supposed alice was one of those peculiar persons whose history sets at naught all theories her parents had been illiterate and coarse in manners but she was gentle and refined they were utterly devoid of imagination and she saw every thing in the sunshine of poetry who is the child like where did she get her queer notions were questions they could never answer they died when she was fourteen and she unaided and unadvised went into factory to earn money to educate herself alternately at the factory and at school she passed four years thanks to her notable mother she was quick and skilful with her needle and knew wonderfully well how to make the most of small means she travelled along unnoticed through the of life rejoicing in birds and flowers and little children and finding sufficient stimulus to constant industry in the love of serving others and the prospect of now and then pretty vase or some agreeable book first affectionate communion then beauty and order were the great attractions to her soul hence she longed inexpressibly home and was always striving to realize her ideal in such humble imitations the little the family where she boarded often disputed with each other and being of rude natures not all alice s unassuming and obliging ways could quite atone to them her native superiority in the solitude of the little she sought refuge from things that wounded her there she spent most of the hours of her life and found peace on the bosom of nature poor and without personal beauty she never dreamed that domestic love at all resembli ng the pattern in her own mind was blessing she could ever realize scarcely had the surface of her heart been tremulous with even passing excitement on the subject till the day she gathered mosses in the wood with geor ge franklin when he looked into her eyes to ascertain what their depth expressed she was troubled by the earnestness of his glance habitually humble she did not venture to indulge the idea that she could ever be beloved by him but when she thoug ht of his promised visit in autumn fair visions sometimes floated before her of how pleasant life would be in tasteful little home with an intelligent companion always it was little home none of her ideas partook of grandeur she was pastoral poet not an epic poet geor ge did come and they had many pleasant walks in beautiful october and crowned each other with garlands of bright autumnal leaves their parting betrayed mutual affection and soon after geor ge wrote to her thus i frankly acknowledge to you that i am ambitious and had fully resolved never to marry poor girl but i love you so well i have choice left and now in the beautiful light that dawns upon i see how mean and selfish was that resolution and how impolitic withal is it not happiness we all seek and how happy it will make to fulfil your 102 103 104 105 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https dream of tasteful home i can not help receiving from you more than i can give your nature is richer than mine but i believe dearest it is always more blessed to give than to receive and when two think so of each other what more need of heaven i am flatterer and i tell you frankly i was disappointed when i first saw you unconsciously to myself i had fallen in love with your soul the transcript of it which i saw in the vines and the flowers attracted first then revelation of it from the marked book the mosses and the ferns i imagined you must be beautiful and when i saw you were not i did not suppose i should ever think of you more but when i heard you talk your soul attracted irresistibly again and i wondered i ever thought you otherwise than beautiful rarely is beautiful soul shrined within beautiful body but loveliness of soul has one great advantage over its frail envelope it need not decrease with time but ought rather to increase of one thing rest assured dear alice it is now impossible ever to love another i love when she read this letter it seemed to her if she were in delightful dream was it indeed possible that the love of an intelligent cultivated soul was offered to her the poor unfriended one how marvellous it seemed that when she was least expecting such blossom from paradise stranger came and laid it in the open book upon her desk in that little ouse where she had toiled with patient humility through so many weary hours she kissed the dear letter again and again she kissed the initials he had written in the book before he had seen her she knelt down and weeping thanked god that the great hunger of her heart happy home was now to be satisfied but when she the letter in calmer mood the uprightness of her nature made her shrink from the proffered bliss he said he was ambitious would he not repent marrying poor girl without beauty and without social influence of any kind might he not find her soul far less lovely than he deemed it under the influence of these fears she answered him how happy your precious letter made i dare not say my heart is like garden when the morning sun shines on it after long cold storm ever since the day we gathe red mosses in the wood you have seem ed so like the fairest dreams of my life that i could not help loving you though i had hope of being beloved in return even now i fear that you are acting under temporary delusion and that hereafter you may repent your choice wait long and observe my faults i will try not to conceal any of them from you seek the society of other women you will find so many superior to in all respects not fear to give pain by any change in your feelings i love you with that disinterested love which would rejoice in your best happiness though it should lead you away from this letter did not lower his estimate of the beauty of her soul he complied with her request to cultivate the acquaintance of other women he saw many more beautiful more graceful more accomplished and of higher intellectual cultivation but none of them seemed so charmingly simple and true alice white not talk to any more about change in my feelings he said i like your principles i like your disposition i like your thoughts i like your ways and i always shall like thus assured alice joyfully dismissed her fears and became his wife rich beyond comparison is man who is loved by an intelligent woman so full of affections especially if she has learned humility and gained strength in the school of hardship and privation but it is only beautiful souls who learn such lessons in adversity in lower natures it engenders discontent and envy which change to pride and extravagance in the hour of prosperity alice had always been made happy by the simplest means and now though her husband s income was moderate one her intuitive taste and capable fingers made his home little bower of beauty she seemed happy bird in her cozy nest and so grateful that geor ge said half in jest half in earnest he believed women loved their husbands the only means society left them of procuring homes over which to preside there was some truth in the remark but it pained her sensitive and affectionate nature because it intruded upon her the idea of selfishness mingled with her love thenceforth she said less about the external blessings of home but in her inmost soul she enjoyed it like an earthly heaven and geor ge seemed to enjoy it almost much herself again and again he said he had never dreamed domestic companionship was so rich blessing his wife though far less educated than himself had nature capable of the highest cultivation she was always an intelligent listener and her quick intuitions often understood far more than he had expressed or thought poor she was she had brought better furniture his home than mahogany chairs and marble tables smoothly glided year away when little daughter came into the domestic circle like flower brought by angels geor ge had often laughed at the credulous fondness of other parents but he really 106 107 108 109 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https his child was the most beautiful one he had ever seen in the countenance and movements he discovered all manner of rare gifts he was sure she had an eye color an eye form and an ear music she had her mother s deep eye and would surely inherit her quick perceptions her loving heart and her earnestness of thought his whole soul seemed bound up in her existence scarcely the mother herself was more devoted to all her infant wants and pleasures thus happy were they with their simple treasures of love and thought when in evil hour disturbing influence crossed their threshold it came in the form of politica l excitement that pestilence which is forever racing through our land seeking whom it may devour destroying happy homes turning aside our intellectual strength from the calm and healthy pursuits of literature or science blinding consciences embittering hearts rasping the tempers of men and blighting half the talent of our country with its feverish breath at that time our citizens were much excited and against the election of general harrison geor ge franklin threw himself into the mel√©e with firm and honest conviction that the welfare of the country depended on his election but the superior and inferior natures of man are forever mingling in all his thoughts and actions and this generous ardor the nation s good gradually opened into perspective of flattering prospects himself by the study and industry of years he had laid solid foundation in his profession and every year brought some increase of income and influence but he had the american impatience of slow growth distinguished in some way he had always wished to be and avenue to the desired object seemed so short the political neighbour whose temperament was peculiarly prone to these excitements came in often and invited him to clubs and meetings when alice was seated at her work with the hope of passing one of their old pleasant evenings she had nervous dread of hearing the lest this man should enter it was not that she expected or wished her husband to sacrifice ambition and enterprise and views of patriotic duty to her quiet habits but the excitement seemed an unhealthy one he lived in species of mental intoxication he talked louder than formerly and doubled his fists in the vehemence of gesticulation he was restless newspapers and watched the arrival of mails he would once have watched over the life of his child all calm pleasures became tame and insipid he was more and more away from home and staid late in the night alice at first sat up to wait him but finding that not conducive to the comfort of their child she gradually formed the habit of retiring to rest before his return she was always careful to leave comfortable arrangement of the fire with his slippers in warm place and some slight refreshment prettily laid out on the table the first time he came home and saw these silent preparations instead of the affectionate face that usually greeted him it made him very sad the rustic with its small belfry and its bright little plat rose up in the perspective of mem ory and he retraced one by one all the incidents of their love fair and serene came those angels of life out of the paradise of the past they smiled upon him and asked are there any like us in the troubled path you have now chosen with these retrospections came some aches concerning little kind attentions forgotten and professional duties neglected under the influence of political excitement he spoke to alice with unusual tenderness that night and voluntarily promised that when the election was fairly over he would withdraw from active participation in politics but this feeling soon passed away the nearer the result of the election approached the more intensely was his whole being absorbed in it one morning when he was reading the newspaper little alice fretted and cried he said impatiently i wish you would carry that child away her noise disturbs tears came to the mother s eyes she answered she is not well poor little thing she has taken i am sorry that he replied and hurried to go out and exult with his neighbour concerning the political tidings at night the child was unusually peevish and restless she toddled up to her father s knees and cried him to rock her to sleep he had just taken her in his arms and laid her little head upon his bosom when the neighbour came him to go to political supper he said the mails that night must bring news that would decide the question the company would wait their arrival and then have jubilee in honour of harrison s success the child cried and screamed when geor ge put her away into the mother s arms and he said sternly naughty girl father don t love her when she she is not well replied the mother with trembling voice and hurried out of the room it was two clock in the morning before geor ge returned but late it was his wife was sitting by the fire hurrah the old coon he exclaimed harrison is she threw herself on his bosom and bursting into tears sobbed out oh hush hush dear geor ge our little alice is dead dead and the last words he had spoken to his darling had been unkind what would he not have given to recall them now and his poor wife had passed through 110 111 112 113 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https agony alone in the silent midnight without aid or consolation from him terrible weight oppressed his heart he sank into chair drew the dear suf ferer to his bosom and wept aloud this great misfortune sadly dimmed the glory of his politica l triumph when the tumult of grief subsided he reviewed the events of his life and weighed them in balance more and more he doubted whether it were wise to leave the slow certainties of his profession chances which had in them the excitement and the risks of gambling more and more seriously he questioned whether the absorption of his faculties in the keen conflicts of the hour was the best way to serve the true interests of his country it is uncertain how the balance would have turned had he not received an appointment to office under the new government perhaps the sudden fall of the triumphal arch occasioned by the death of general harrison might have given him lasting distaste politics it did to many others but the proffered income was more than double the sum he had ever received from his profession dazzled by the prospect he did not sufficiently take into the account that it would necessarily involve him in many additional expenses political and social and that he might lose it by the very next turn of the wheel without being able to return easily to his old habits of expenditure once in office the conviction that he was on the right side combined with gratitude and to make him serve his party with money and personal influence the question of another election was soon agitated and these motives drove him into the new excitement he was kind at home but he spent little time there he sometimes smiled when he came in late and saw the warm slippers by the fire and vase of flowers crownin g his supper on the table but he did not think how lonely alice must be nor could he possibly dream what she was suffering in the slow martyrdom of her heart he gave dinners and suppers often strangers went and came they ate and drank and smoked and talked loud alice was polite and attentive but they had nothing her and she had nothing them how out of place would have been her little songs and her fragrant flowers amid their clamor and she was pastoral poet living in perpetual battle the house was filled with visitors to see the long whig procession pass by with caparisoned horses gay banners flowery arches and promises of protection to every thing geor ge bowed from his chariot and touched his hat to her he passed with the throng and she waved her handkerchief how beautiful how magnificent exclaimed visitor who stood by her clay will certainly be elected the whole city seems to be in the procession sailors printers firemen every there are women and children replied alice and she turned away with sigh the only protection that interested her was protection homes soon after came the evening procession of democrats the army of horses temples of liberty with figures in women s dress to represent the goddess raccoons hung and guillotined and swallowed by alligators the lone star of texas everywhere glimmering over their heads the whole shadowy mass occasionally illuminated by the rush of and the fitful glare of lurid torches all this made strange and wild impression on the mind of alice whose nervous system had suffered in the painful internal conflicts of her life it reminded her of the memo rable 10th of august in paris and she had visions of human heads reared on poles before the windo ws they had been before the palace of the unfortunate maria antoinette visitors observed their watches and said it took this procession an hour longer to pass than it had the whig procession i guess polk will beat after all said one geor ge was angry and combated the opinion vehemently even after the company had all gone and the street noises had long passed off in the distance he continued remarkably moody and irritable he had more cause it than his wife was aware of she supposed the worst that could happen would be defeat of his party and loss of office but antagonists long accustomed to calculate political games with view to gambling had dared him to bet on the election being perfectly aware of his sanguine temperament and geor ge stimulated solely by wish to prove to the crowd who heard them that he considered the success of clay s party certain allowed himself to be drawn into the snare to ruinous extent all his worldly possessions even his watch his books and his household furniture were at stake and ultimately all were lost alice sympathized with his deep dejection tried to forget her own sorrows and said it would be easy her to assist him she was so accustomed to earn her own living on their wedding day geor ge had given her landscape of the rustic embowered in vines and shaded by its graceful elm he asked to have this reserved from the wreck and stated 114 115 116 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https reason one had the heart to refuse it even amid the mad excitement of party triumph everybody said i pity his poor she left her cherished home before the final breaking up it would have been too much her womanly heart to see those beloved house hold goods carried away to the she lingered long by the astral lamp and the little round table where she and geor ge used to read to each other in the first happy year of their marriage she did not weep it would have been well if she could she took with her the little vase that used to stand on the desk in the old country house and curious wedgewood pitcher geor ge had given her on the day little alice was born she did not show them to him it would make him so sad he was tender and and she tried to be very strong that she might sustain him but health had suffered in these storms and her organization fitted her only one mission in this world that was to make and adorn home through hard and lonely years she had longed it she had gained it and thanked god with the joyfulness of happy heart and now her vocation was gone in few days hers was pronounced case of melancholy insanity she was placed in the hospital where her husband strives to surround her with every thing to heal the wounded soul but she does not know him when he visits her she looks at him with strange eyes and still clinging to the fond ideal of her life she repeats mournfully i want my home why don t geor ge come and take home thus left adrift on the dark ocean of life geor ge franklin hesitated whether to trust the chances of politics another office or to start again in his profession and slowly rebuild his shattered fortunes from the ruins of the past having wisely determined in favor of the latter he works diligently and lives economically cheered by the hope that reason will again dawn in the beautiful soul that loved him so truly his case may seem like an extreme one but in truth he is only one of thousand similar wrecks continually floating over the turbulent sea of american politics to the trailing arbutus 117 118 119 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https delicate and fragrant thing sweet prophet of the coming spring to what can poetry compare thy hidden beauty fresh and fair only they who search can find thy trailing garlands close enshrined unveiling like lovely face surprising them with artless grace thou seemest like some sleeping babe upon leafy pillow laid dreaming in thy unconscious rest of nest ling on mother s breast or like maiden in life s may fresh dawning of her girlish day when the pure tint her cheeks disclose seems reflection of the rose more coy than hidden love thou art with blushing hopes about its heart and thy faint breath of fragrance seems like kisses stolen in our dreams thou rt like gentle poet s thought by nature s simplest lessons taught reclining on old trees communing with the whisp ring breeze like timid natures that

way down to rippling brook in the rear of friend goodman s house and there by mound of rocks that dipped their mossy feet in the rivulet friend goodman walked slowly watching his little daughter who had been spending the day 120 121 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https some children in the neighbourhood presently the small maiden came jumping along with her bonnet thrown back and the edges of her soft brown ringlets luminous in the rays of the setting sun those pretty curls were not quakerly but nature who pays more attention to the regulations of elders than she does to the edicts of bishops would have it so at the slightest breath of moisture the silky hair rolled itself into spirals and clustered round her pure white forehead if it loved the jumping likewise was not quakerly proceeding but little alice usually staid and demure in imitation of those around her had met with new companion whose temperament was more mercurial than her own and she was yielding to its magnetic influence camillo campbell boy of six years was the grandson of an italian lady who had married an irish absentee resident in florence her descendants had lately come to ireland and taken possession of estates in the immediate neighbourhood of friend goodman where little camillo s foreign complexion lively temperament and graceful broken language rendered him an object of very great interest especially among the children he it was with whom little alice was skipping through the green lane bright and free the wind and sunshine that played among her curls the sober father watched their innocent gambols he felt his own pulses quicke n and his motions involuntarily became more rapid and elastic than usual the little girl came nestling up to his side and rubbed her head upon his arm like petted kitten camillo peeped roguishly from behind the mossy rocks kissed his hand to her and ran of f hopping first on one foot and then on the other dost thou like that little boy inquired friend goodman he stooped to kiss his darling yes camillo s pretty boy i like him she replied then with skip and bound which showed that the electric fluid was still leaping in her veins she added he s funny boy too he swears you all the the simple child being always accustomed to hear thee and thou verily thought you was profane word her father did what was very unusual with him he laughed outright he replied what strange boy is that he asked to come down to the rock and play may i go after school she asked we will see what mother says he replied but where didst thou meet camillo he came to play with us in the lane and deborah and john and i went into his garden to see the birds oh he has got such pretty birds there s nice little in the garden and there s woman standing there with baby camillo calls her my donny he says we mustn t play in there why not who is my donny the people of italy where camillo used to live call the mother of christ madonna replied her father and who is christ she asked he was holy man who lived great many years ago i read to thee one day about his taking little children in his arms and blessing i guess he loved little children almost well thou dear father said alice but what they put his mother in that little not deeming it wise to puzzle her busy little brain with theological explanations friend goodman called her attention to small dog whose curly white hair soon displaced the madonna and even camillo in her thoughts but the new neighbour and the conservatory peopled with birds and the little chapel in the garden made strong impression on her mind she was always talking of them and in after years they remained by far the most vivid picture in the gallery of childish recollections nearly every day she and camillo met at the mossy rock where they planted flowers in blossom and buried flies in clover and launched little boats on the stream when they strolled toward the conservatory the old gardener was always glad to admit them flowering shrubs and gaudy parrots so bright in the warm sunshine formed such cheerful contrast to her own unadorned home that little alice was never weary with gazing and wondering but from all the brilliant things she chose two java sparrows her especial favorites the old gardener told her they were quaker birds because their feathers were all of such soft quiet color bright little camillo caught up the idea and said i know what you so much like them quaker they and she s quaker too said the old gardener smiling he patted her on the head she s nice little poll parrot heard him and repeated always after that 122 123 124 125 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https alice entered the conservatory the parrot laughed and screamed near the door were two niches partially concealed by of vines and in the niches were statues of two winged children alice inquired who they were and camillo replied my little sister and brother children of the madonna now they his mother had told him this and he did not understand what it meant neither did alice she looked up at the winged ones with timid love and said why don t they come down and play with us from heaven they can not come down answered camillo alice was about to inquire the reason why when the parrot interrupted her by calling out bird and camillo began to mock her then laughing merrily off they ran to the mossy rock to plant some flowers the gardener had given them that night while alice was eating her supper friend goodman chanced to read aloud something in which the word heaven occurred i ve been to heaven said alice hush hush my child replied her father but i have been to heaven she insisted little children have wings there her parents exchanged glances of surprise and the mother asked how dost thou know that little children have wings in heaven because i saw them she replied they wear white gowns and they are the children of my donny my donny lives in the little in camillo s garden she s the mother of christ that loved little children so much but she never said any thing to the birds call in her mother looked very sober she gets her head full of strange things down there yonder said she i tell thee joseph i don t like to have the children playing together so much there s telling what may come of oh they are mere babes replied joseph the my donny she calls it and her doll are all the same to her the children take deal of comfort together and it seems to it is not worth while to put estrangement between them divisions come fast enough in the human family when he is lad he will go away to school and college and will come back to live in totally different world from ours let the little ones enjoy themselves while they thus spake the friend joseph but rachel was not so easily satisfied i don t like this talk about graven images said she if the child s head gets full of such notions it may not prove so easy to put them out truly there seemed some ground rachel s fears whether alice walked or slept she seemed to live in the neighbour s garden sitting beside her mother in the silent quaker meeting she forgot the row of plain bonnets before her and saw vision of winged childr en through veil of vines at school she heard the old green parrot scream and doves and java sparrows hopped into her dreams she had never heard fairy story in her life otherwise she would doubtless have imagined that camillo was prince who lived in an enchanted palace and had some powerful fairy friend it came to pass joseph had predicted these days of happy companionship soon passed away camillo went to distant school then to college and then was absent awhile on the continent it naturally happened that the wealthy catholic family had but little intercourse with the substantial quaker farmer years passed without word between alice and her former playfellow once during his college life she met him and his father on horseback she was riding home from meeting on small gray mare her father had given her he touched his hat and said how you miss goodman and she replied how art thou camillo his father inquired who is that young woman and he answered she is the daughter of farmer goodman with whom i used to play sometimes when i was little thus like shadows they passed on their separate ways he thought more of the rustic quaker girl and with her the bright picture of their childhood was like the remembrance of last year s rainbow but events now approached which put all rainbows and flowers to flight rebellion broke out in ireland and terrible civil war began to rage between catholics under the name of pikemen and protestants under the name of orangeme the quakers being conscientiously opposed to war could not adopt the emblems of either party and were of course exposed to the hostility of both joseph goodman in common with others of his religious persuasion had always professed to believe that 126 127 128 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https good evil was heavenly principle and therefore safe policy alice had received this belief traditionary inheritance without disputing it or reflecting upon it but now came times that tested faith severely every night they retired to rest with the consciousness that their worldly possessions might be destroyed by fire and pillage before morning and perhaps their lives sacrificed by infuriated soldiers at the and by the earnest were the exhortations of the brethren to stand by their principles and not flinch in this hour of trial joseph goodman s sermon was brief and impressive the gospel of love has power to regenerate the world said he and the humblest individual who lives according to it has done something the salvation of his strength was soon tried the very next day party of pikemen came into the neighbourhood and set fire to all the houses of the orangemen groans and shrieks and the sharp sound of shots were heard in every direction fierce men rushed into their peaceful dwelling demanding food and ordering them to give up their arms food i will give but arms i have none replied joseph more shame you roared the commander of the troop if you can t any thing more your country than that you may well be killed at once coward you he drew his sword but joseph did not wink at the flash of the glittering blade he looked him calmly in the eye and said if thou art willing to take the crime of murder on thy conscience i can not help it i would not willingly harm to thee or to any the soldier turned away abashed and putting his sword into the scabbard he muttered well give us something to eat will you the hours that followed were frightful with the light of blazing houses the crash of musketry and the screams of women and children flying across the fields many took refuge in joseph s house and he did all he could to soothe and strengthen them at sunset he went forth with his serving to seek the wounded and the dead along the road and among the bushes mangled bodies were lying in every direction those in whom life remained they brought with all tenderness and consigned to the care of rachel and alice and long they could see they gathered the dead burial in the evening the captain of the pikemen returned in great wrath this is rather too much he exclaimed we did nt spare your house this morning to have it converted into hospital the damned orangemen turn out every dog of or we will burn it down over your i can not stay thy hand if thou hast the heart to it mildly replied joseph but i will not desert my in their great distress if the time should come when thy party is routed we will bury thy dead and nurse thy wounded we have done the orangemen i will good to all parties and harm to none here i take my stand and thou mayest kill if thou again the soldier was arrested by power he knew not how to resist joseph seeing his embarrassment added i put the question to thee man of war is it manly to persecute women and children is it brave to torture the wounded and the dying wouldst thou feel easy to think of it in thy dying hour let us part in peace and when thou hast need of friend come to after brief hesitation the soldier said it would be happier world if all thought you then calling to his men he said let us be of f boys there s nothing to be done fortnight after triumphant orangemen came with loud uproar to destroy the houses of the catholics it was scarcely when alice was roused from uneasy slumb ers by the dischar ge of musketry and lurid light on the walls of her room starting up she beheld colonel campbell s house in blaze the beautiful statues of the madonna and the winged children were knocked to pieces and crushed under the feet of an angry mob vines and flowers crisped under the crackling flames and the beautiful birds from foreign climes fell suffocated in the smoke or flew forth frightened into woods and fields and perished by cruel hands in the green lane once so peaceful and pleasant ferocious men were scuffling and trampling shooting and stabbing everywhere the grass and the moss were dabbled with blood above all the din were heard the shrill screams of women and children and the mother of camillo came flying into joseph s house exclaiming hide oh hide alice received her in her arms laid the throbbing head tenderly on her bosom put back the hair that was falling in wild disorder over her face and tried to calm her terror with gentle words others came pouring in and one was refused shelter to the wome n of colonel campbell s household alice relinquished her own little bedroom the only corner of the house that was not already filled to overflowing she drew the curtain that the afflicted ones need not witness 129 130 131 132 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https bloody skirmishing in the fields and lane below but loud shriek soon recalled her to their side mary campbell had withdrawn the curtain and seen her husband fall thrust at by dozen swords and hysterics succeeded each other in quick succession while alice and her mother laid her on the bed and rubbed her hands and bathed her temples gradually the sounds of war died away in the distance then joseph and his helpers went forth to gather up the wounded and the dead colonel campbell was found utterly lifeless and the brook where camillo used to launch his little boats was red with his father s blood they brought him in tenderly washed the ghastly wounds closed the glaring eyes and left the widow and the household to mourn over him late in the night they persuaded her to go to rest and when all was still the weary family fell asleep on the floor not bed was unoccupied this time they hoped to escape the conquerors rage but early in the morning party of them came back and demanded that all the catholics should be given up to them joseph replied he had done before i can not give up my helpless and dying neighbours whether they be pikemen or orangemen i will good to all and harm to none come to what may that s impartial anyhow said the captain he took some orange cockades from his pocket and added w ear these and my men will you i can not conscientiously wear one replied joseph because they are emblems of war the captain laughed half scornfully and handing one to alice said well my good girl you can wear one and then you need not be afraid of our she looked very pleasantly in his face and answered i should be afraid if i did not trust in something better than the leader of the orangemen was arrested by the same spell that stopped the leader of the pikemen but some of his followers who had been lingering about the door called out what s the use of parleying isn t the old traitor nursing catholics to fight us again when they get well if he won t serve the government by fighting us he will at least to stop bullet well braver man bring him out and put him in the front ranks to be shot at one of them seized joseph to drag him away but alice laid trembling hand on his arm and said beseechingly before you take him come and see the wounded orangemen with their wives and children whom my father and mother have fed and tended night and pale figure with bandaged head and one arm in sling came forth from an adjoining room and said comrades you surely will not harm these worthy people they have fed our children and buried our dead if we were their own the soldiers listened and suddenly changing their mood went of f shouting hurrah the quakers some days of comparative quiet followe colonel campbell was buried in his own garden with much deference to the wishes of his widow circumstances would permit she returned from the funeral calmer than she had been and quietly assisted in taking care of the wounded but when she retired to her little room and saw crucifix fastened on the wall at the foot of her bed she burst into tears and said who has done this alice gently replied i did it i found it in the mud where the little chapel used to stand i know it is sacred emblem to thee and i thought it would pain thee to have it there so i have washed it carefully and placed it in thy the bereaved catholic kissed the friendly hand that had done so kind deed and tears fell on it she murmured good child may the holy virgin bless thee balmy is blessing from any human heart whether it be given in the name of jesus or mary god or allah alice slept well and guardian angels rejoiced over her in heaven success alternated between the contending parties and kept the country in state of perpetual alarm one week the widow of colonel campbell was surrounded by victorious friends and the next week she was in terror her life at last camillo himself came with band of successful insur gents during brief and agitated interview with his mother he learned how kindly she had been sheltered in their neighbour s house and how tenderly the remains of his father had been treated when she pointed to the crucifix on the wall and told its history his eyes filled with tears oh why can not we of different faith always treat each other thus was his inward thought but he bowed his head in silence hearing loud voices he started up suddenly exclaiming there may be danger below following the noise he found soldiers threatening friend good man who stood with his back firmly placed against the door of an inner room seeing camillo enter and being aware of the great influence his family had with the catholics he said these men insist upon carrying out 133 134 135 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https dying orangemen who are sheltered here and compelling to see them shot is it thy will that these murders should be committed the young man took his hand and in tones of deep respect answered could you believe that i would suffer violence to be done to any under your roof if i had power to prevent it then turning to his soldiers he said these excellent people have injured one through all these troubled times they have been kind alike to pikemen and orangemen they have buried our dead and sheltered our widows if you have any respect the memory of my father treat with respect all who wear the peaceful garb of the the men spoke apart awhile and soon after left the house camillo passed by the kitchen door he saw alice distributing boiled potatoes to crowd of hungry children soldier stood by her insisting that she should wear cross which was the emblem of the pikemen she mildly replied i can not consent to wear the cross but i hope god will enable to bear the rude fellow who was somewhat intoxicated touched her under the chin and said come mavourneen be little more camillo instantly seized his arm and exclaiming behave decently my lad behave decently he led him to the door he went he turned towards alice with an expression she never forgot and said in low deep tone words are poor to thank you what you have done my mother the next day when he met alice walking to meeting he touched his hat respectfully and said i scarcely deem it prudent you to be in the roads at this time miss alice armed insur gents are everywhere abroad and though there is prevailing disposition not to injure the quakers still many of our men are too desperate to be always she smiled and answered i thank thee thy friendly caution but i trust in the power that has hitherto protected after short pause he said your place of meeting is two miles from here where is the horse you used to ride soldier took it from i rode from meeting several weeks ago she replied you see then it is i have said unsafe you to go he rejoined had you not better turn back with great earnestness she answered friend camillo i can not otherwise than go our people are afflicted and bowed down the soldiers have nearly consumed our provisions our women are almost worn out with the fatigue of constant nursing and perpetual alarms all are not unwavering in their faith it is the duty of the strong to sustain the weak and therefore it is needful that we meet together counsel and the young man looked at her with affectionate reverence the fair complexion and shining ringlets of childhood were gone but serene and deep expression of soul imparted more elevated beauty to her countenance he parted from her with blessing simply and fervently uttered but he entered the adjoining fields and he walked along he kept her within sight until she arrived safely at the place of meeting while he thus watched her unseen he recollected how often his taste had been offended by the quaint awkwardness of the quaker garb and uttering aloud the sequel to his thoughts he said but beautiful and graceful will her garments be in soon after this interview he departed with strong escort to convey his mother and other catholic women into less turbulent district alice bade them farewell with undisguised sadness we learn to love those whom we serve and there seemed little probability that they would ever return to reside in that troubled neighborhood the next time she saw camillo he was brought into her father s house on litter senseless and wounded it was supposed unto death all the restoratives they could think of were applied and at last alice bent over him bathing his temples he opened his eyes with dull unconscious stare which gradually relaxed into feeble smile he whispered my quaker some hours afterward when she brought him drink he gently pressed her hand and said thank you dear the words were simple but the expression of his eyes and the pressure of his hand sent thrill through the maiden which she had never before experienced that night she dreamed of winged children seen through flowering vines and camillo laughed when the parrot called her sorrow like love levels all distinctions and melts all forms in its fiery furnace in the midst of sickness and suffering and familiarity with death there was small attention paid to customary proprieties one heeded whether camillo were tended by alice or her mother but if 136 137 138 139 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https were long absent he complained that she came so seldom his health improved they talked together of the flowers they used to plant on the mossy rock and the little boats they launched on the rippling brook sometimes in their merriest moods they mocked the laughing of the old green parrot and the cooing of the doves thus walking through the green lanes of their childhood they came unconsciously into the of love all was bright and golden there and but one shadow rested on the sunshine when camillo spoke of the little in the garden and the image of my donny she grew very thoughtful and he said with sigh i wish dear alice that we were of one religion she smiled sweetly she answered are we not both of the religion of jesus he kissed her hand and said your soul is always large and liberal and noble and kind but others are not like you dear and truly when the war had ceased and camillo campbell began to rebuild his demolished dwelling and the young couple spoke of marriage great was the consternation in both families even the joseph was to have his daughter marr y out of society their phrase is but he strove to console rachel who was far more afflicted than himself the young people love each other he said and it does not seem to be right to put any constraint on their affection camillo is goodly youth and i think the dreadful scenes he has lately witnessed have exercised his mind powerfully on the subject of war i have observed that he is thoughtful and candid and if he does but act up to his own light it is all i ask of him he promises never to interfere with the freedom of alice and she has adopted most of our principles from her own conviction i not fear she will ever depart from don t comfort thyself with any such idea replied rachel she will have pictures of the virgin mary in her house and priests will come there to say over their mummery and small beginnings make great endings at all events one thing is certain alice will lose her membership in our society and that it is which mainly grieves she is such serious sensible girl that i always hoped to see her an esteemed minister among it is disappointment to also replied joseph but we must bear it cheerfully it certainly is better to have our child go out of the society and keep her principles than it would be to have her stay in society and depart from her principles many mary campbell was more disturbed than rachel goodman in the first paroxysm of her distress she said she wished she had been killed in the war rather than live to see her only son married to black protestant not black protestant dear mother only one rejoined camillo playfully then he kissed her and reminded her of the story of the crucifix and told her how noble and gentle and good and sensible his alice was he talked vision rose before her of the little bedroom in the quaker s she saw rachel and alice supporting the of poor homeless catholics while they offered drink to their feverish lips and memory melted bigotry she threw herself weeping into camillo s arms and said truly they did treat us like disciples of jesus i once said to alice may the holy virgin bless thee and i now say from my heart may the holy virgin bless you both my and so catholic and quaker were married according to the forms of both their churches the society of friends mostly withdrew from companionship with alice though they greeted her kindly at their meetings the catholics shook their heads and complained that camillo campbell was already half quaker both prognosticated evil consequences from such union but the worst that happened was alice learned that there might be superstition in the cut of garment well in veneration an image and camillo became convinced that hatred and violence were much greater sins than eating meat on fridays note course here described general ly pursued by quakers during the irish rebellion and the ef fect stated to be produced on the soldiers of both parties are strictly true the rival mechanicians i am growing old my sight is failing very fast said

whichever of you produces the most perfect piece of mechanism before the end of two years shall be my partner and representative if rosabella and i both agree in the the who was busily spinning flax looked up bashfully and met the glance of the two young men the countenance of one flushed and his eye sparkled the other turned very pale and there was painfully deep intensity in his fixed gaze the one who blushed was florien arnaud youth from the french cantons he was slender and graceful in figure with beautiful features clear blue eyes and complexion fresh hylas when the enamored water carried him away in their arms he danced like zephyr and sang little airy french romanzas in the sweetest of tenor voices the one who turned pale was pierre berthoud of geneva he had massy features bulky frame and clumsy motions but the shape of his head indicated powerful intellect and his great dark eyes glowed from under the of his brows like forge at midnight he played on the and the trombone and when he sang the tones sounded if they came up from deep iron mines rosabella turned quickly away from their expressive glances and blushing deeply resumed her spinning the frenchman felt certain the blush was him the genevan thought he would willingly give his life to be sure it was him but unlike the young men were in person and character and both attracted toward the same lovely maiden they were yet extremely friendly to each other and usually found enjoyment in the harmonious contrast of their different gifts the first feeling of estrangement that came between them was one evening when florien sang remarkably well and rosabella accompanied him on her guitar she evidently enjoyed the gracefu l music with all her soul her countenance was more radiantly beauti ful than usual and when the fascinating singer rose to go she begged him to sing another favorite song and then another and another she never urges to sing with her said pierre he and florien retired the night and with very good reason replied his friend laughing your stentorian tones would quite drown her weak sweet voice and her light touch on the guitar you might well have hammer nvil accompaniment to canary seeing discontent in the countenance of his companion he added soothingly nay my good friend don t be offended by this playful comparison your voice is magnificently strong and beautifully correct but it is made grander things than those graceful little garlands of sound which rosabella and i weave so easily pierre sprang up quickly and went to the other side of the room rosabella and i were sounds that went hissing through his heart like arrow but his manly efforts soon conquered the jealous feeling and he said cheerfully well florien let us accept the offer of good father breguet we will try our skill fairly and honorably and leave him and rosabella to decide without knowing which is your work and which is florien suppressed rising smile he thought to himself she will know my workmanship easily she could distinguish my fairy romanzas from your samson but he replied right cordially honestly and truly pierre i think we are mechanicians very nearly equal in skill but let us both tax our ingenuity to invent something which will best please rosabella her comes in about six months in honor of the occasion i will make some ornaments the little arbor facing the brook where she loves to sit in pleasant weather and read to the good old grandfather i will the same answered pierre only let both our ornaments be they clasped hands and looking frankly into each other s eyes ratified the agreement from that hour they spoke more to each other on the subject till the day arrived the old and his grandchild were invited to the arbor to pass judgment on the productions of his pupils screen was placed before portion of the brook and they sat quietly waiting it to be removed that duck is of singular color exclaimed the young girl what solemn looking fellow he is the bird without paying any attention to her remarks waddled into the water drank lifted up his bill to the sky if giving thanks his refreshment flapped his wings floated to the edge of the brook and waddled on the grass again when father breguet threw some crumbs of cake on the ground the duck picked them up with apparent satisfaction he was about to scatter more crumbs when rosabella exclaimed why grandfathe r this is not duck it is made of bronze see how well it is done 144 145 146 147 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https old man took it up and examined it really i not think any thing could be more perfect than this he said how exquisitely the feathers are carved and truly the creature seems alive he who beats this must be skilful at these words pierre and florien stepped forward hand in hand and bowing to their master removed the temporary screen on black marble pedestal in the brook was seated bronze naiad leaning on an overflowing vase the figure was inexpressibly graceful silver star with brilliant points gleamed on her forehead and in her hand she held silver bell beautifully inlaid with gold and steel there was smile about her mouth and she leaned over if watching something in little cascade which flowed down channel in the pedestal presently she raised her hand and sounded the bell beautiful little gold fish obeyed the summons and glided down the channel his burnished sides glittering in the sun eleven times more she rang the bell and each time the gold fish darted forth it was exactly noon and the water was clock the and his daughter were silent it was so beautiful that they could not easily find words to express their pleasure you need not speak my master said pierre in manly but sorrowful tone i myself decide in favor of florien the clock is the interior workmanship is not yet examined rejoined his amiable competitor the re is not better mechanician in all switzerland than pierre ah but you know how to invest equally good workmanship with grace and beauty replied the more heavily moulded genevan study the graces my boy make yourself familiar with models of beauty said old antoine breguet laying friendly hand upon the young man s shoulder i should but imitate and he creates answered pierre despondingly and worst of all my good master i hate myself because i envy but you have many and noble gifts pierre said rosabella gently you know how delightfully very different instruments combine in harmony grandfather says your workmanship will be far more durable than florien perhaps you may both be his but which of us will be thine thought pierre he smothered deep sigh and only answered i thank you well aware that these envious feelings were unworthy of noble soul he contended with them bravely and treated florien even more cordially than usual i will follow our good master s advice said he i will try to clothe my good machinery in forms of beauty let us both make watch rosabella and present it to her on her next you will rival doubt the graces threw their garlands on you when you were bravo shouted florien laughing and clapping his hands the poetry is kindling up in your soul i always told you that you would be poet if you could only express what was in and your soul expresses itself so easily so fluently said pierre with sigh because my springs lie so near the surface and yours have depths to come from replied his companion the worst of it is the cord is apt to break before i can draw up my weighty treasures rejoined pierre with smile there is help it there will always be the same difference between us that there is in our names i am rock and you are flower i might be hewed and chiselled into harmonious proportions but you grow into beauty then be rock and magnificent one replied his friend and let the flower grow at your that sounds modestly and well answered pierre but i wish to be flower because what inquired florien though he half guessed the secret from his embarrassed manner because i think rosabella likes flowers better than rocks replied pierre with uncommon quickness if the words gave him pain on new year s day the offerings enclosed in one box were presented by the good grandfather the first was golden apple which opened and revealed on one side an exquisitely neat watch surrounded by garland tastefully wrought in rich damaskeening of steel and gold on the other side was rose intertwined with very perfectly done in mosaic when the stem of the apple was turned favourite little tune of rosabella s sounded from within 148 149 150 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https this is surely florien s thought she and she looked the other gift with less interest it was an elegant little gold watch with persian landscape gazelle and birds of paradise beautifully engraved on the back when spring was touched the watch opened little circular plate of gold slid away and up came beautiful rose round which jewelled bee buzzed audibly on the edge of the golden circle below were the words rosa bella in ultramarine enamel when another spring was touched the rose went away and the same melody that sounded from the heart of the golden apple seemed to be played by fairies on tinkling it paused moment and then struck up lively dance the circular plate again rolled away and up sprung an with enamelled scarf and very small diamond on her brow leaping and whirling on an almost invisible thread of gold she kept perfect time to the music and turned her scarf most gracefully rosa bella drew long breath and roseate tinge mantled her beautiful face she met her grandfather s gaze fixed lovingly upon her she thought to herself there is doubt now which is florien s but she said aloud they are both very beautiful are they not dear grandfather i am not worthy that so much pains should be taken to please the old man smiled upon her and fondly patted the luxuriant brown hair which shone like threads of amber in the sun which dost thou think most beautiful said he she evaded the question by asking which you i will tell thee when thou hast decided answered he she twisted and untwisted the strings of her boddice and said she was afraid she should not be impartial why not he inquired she looked down bashfully and murmured in very low voice because i can easily guess which is florien ah ha exclaimed the kind old man and he playfully chucked her under the chin he added then i suppose i shall of fend thee when i give verdict the bee and the she looked up blushing and her large serious brown eyes had moment comic expression she said i shall the never were disciples of the beautiful placed in circumstances more favourable to the development of poetic souls the cottage of antoine breguet was in glade where the sun harbours and one side of it listens to bees another to brook lovers that have just parted the night dream of such spots when they have said their prayers or some tired parent holding by the hand child and walking toward the setting in the stillness of the night they could hear the rushing of the arrowy from neighbouring eminence could be seen the transparent lake of geneva reflecting the deep blue heaven above mountains in all fantasti c forms enclosed them round now draped in heavy masses of sombre clouds and now half revealed through vapour like veil of gold the flowing silver of little waterfalls gleamed among the dark rocks hung their rich festoons by the roadside and the beautiful barberry bush embroidered their leaves with its scarlet clusters they lived under the same roof with guilele ss good old man and with an innocent maiden just merging into beautiful womanhood and more than all they were both under the influence of that great inspirer love rosabella was so uniformly kind to both that pierre could never relinquish the hope that constant devotedness might in time win her affections himself florien having more cheerful character and more reliance on his own fascinations was merely anxious that the lovely maiden should prefer his workmanship decidedly she did his person and manners under this powerful stimulus in addition to the ambition excited by the old s propo sal the competition between them was active and incessant but the groundwork of their characters was so good that all little of envy or jealousy were quickly checked by the predomina nce of generous and kindly sentiments one evening rosabella was reading to her grandfather description of an albino squirrel the pure white animal with pink eyes and feathery tail pleased her fancy extremely and she expressed strong desire to see one pierre said nothing but not long after they sat eating grapes after 151 152 153 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https white squirrel leaped on the table frisked from shoulder to shoulder and at last sat up with grape in its paws rosabella uttered an exclamation of delight is it alive she said you not see that it is rejoined pierre call the dog and see what he thinks about we have so many things here which are alive and yet not alive she replied smiling florien warmly praised the pretty automaton but he was somewhat vexed that he himself did not think of making the graceful little animal which the maiden had expressed wish her pet canary had died the day before and his eye happened to rest on the empty cage hanging over the flower i too will give her pleasure thought he few weeks after they sat at breakfast sweet notes were heard from the cage precisely the same the canary used to sing and looking up the astonished maiden saw him hoppin g about nibbling at the sugar and pecking his feathers lively ever florien smiled and said is it much alive pierre s squirrel the approach of the next was watched with eager expectation even the old man began to feel keen pleasure in the competition if he had witnessed race between fleet horses pierre excited by the maiden s declaration that she mistook his golden apple florien s workmanship produced much more elegant specimen of art than he had ever before conceived it was barometer supported by two knights in silver who went in when it rained and came out when the sun shone on the top of the barometer was small silver basket of exceedingly delicate workmanship filled with such flowers close in damp weather when the knights retired these flowers closed their enamelled petals and when the knights returned the flowers expanded florien produced silver chariot with two spirited and finely proportioned horses revolving circle in the wheels showed on what day of the month occurred each day of the week throughout the year each month was surmounted by its zodiacal sign beautifully enamelled in green crimson and gold at ten clock the figure of young girl wearing rosabella s usual costume and resembling her in form and features ascended slowly from behind the wheel and at the same moment the three graces rose up in the chariot and held garlands over her from the emer ged young man in florien s dress and kneeling of fered rose to the maiden it was so beautiful whole and so exquisitely finished in all its details that pierre clenched his fingers till the nails cut him so hard did he try to conceal the bitterness of his disappointment at his own manifest inferiority could he have been an hour alone all would have been well but he stepped out on the piazza followed by florien he saw him kiss his hand triumphantly to rosabella and she returned it with modest but expressive glance unfortunately he held in his hand jewelled dagger of turkish workmanship which antoine breguet had asked him to return to its case in the workshop stung with disappointed love and ambition the tempestuous feelings so painfully restrained burst forth like whirlwhin quick flash of lightning he made thrust at his graceful rival then frightened at what he had done and full of horror at thoughts of rosabella s distress he rushed into the road and up the sides of the mountain like madman year passed and one heard tidings of him on the anniversary of rosabella s birth the aged grandsire sat alone sunning his white locks at the open window when pierre barthoud entered pale and haggard he was such skeleton of his former self that his master did not recognize him till he knelt at his feet and said give father i am the poor old man shook violently and covered his face with trembling hands ah thou wretched one said he how darest thou come hither with murder on thy soul murder exclaimed pierre in voice so terribly deep and distinct that it seemed to freeze the feeble blood of him who listened is he then dead did i kill the beautiful youth whom i loved so much he fell forward on the floor and the groan that came from his stron g chest was like an earthquake tearing up trees by the roots antoine breguet was deeply moved and the tears flowed fast over his furrowed face rise my son said he and make thy escape lest they come to arrest let them come replied pierre gloomi ly why should i live then raising his head from the floor he said slowly and with great fear father where is rosabella the old man covered his face and sobbed out i shall never see her again these old eyes will never again look on her blessed many minutes they remained thus and when he repeated i shall never see her again the young man clasped his feet convulsively and groaned in agony 154 155 156 157 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https last the housekeeper came in woman whom pierre had known and loved in boyhood when her first surprise was over she promised to conceal his arrival and persuaded him to go to the garret and try to compose his too strongly excited feelings in the course of the day she explained to him how florien had died of his wound and how rosabella pined away in silent melancholy often sitting at the spinning wheel with the suspended thread in her hand if unconscious where she was during all that wretched night the young man could not close his eyes in sleep phantoms of the past flitted through his brain and remorse gnawed at his in the deep stillness of midnight he seemed to hear the voice of the bereaved old man sounding mournfully distinct i shall never see her again he prayed earnestly to die but suddenly an idea flashed into his mind and revived his desire to live full of his new project he rose early and sought his good old master sinking on his knees he exclaimed oh my father say that you forgive i implore you to give my guilty soul that one gleam of consolation believe i would sooner have died myself than have killed him but my passions were by nature so strong oh god forgive they were so strong how i have curbed them he alone knows alas that they should have burst the bounds in that one mad moment and destroyed the two i best loved on earth oh father can you say that you give with quivering voice he replied i forgive you and bless you my poor he laid his hand affectionately on the thick matted hair and added i too have need of forgiveness i did very wrong thus to put two generous natures in rivalship with each other genuine love of beauty its own sake is the only healthy stimulus to produce the beautiful the spirit of competition took you out of your sphere and placed you in false position in grand conceptions and in works of durability and strength you would always have excelled florien much he surpassed you in tastefulness and elegance by striving to be what he was you parted with your own gifts without attaining to his every man in the natural sphere of his own talent and all in harmony this is the true order my son and i tempted you to violate it in my foolish pride i earnestly desired to have successor to the famous antoine breguet i wanted that the old stand should be kept up in all its glory and continue to rival all competitors i thought you could florien s gifts to your own and yet retain your own characteristic excellencies therefore i stimulated your intellect and imagination to the utmost without reflecting that your heart might break in the process god forgive it was too severe trial poor human nature and thou my son forgive this insane ambition severely has my pride been pierre could not speak but he covered the wrinkled hands with kisses and clasped his knees convulsively at last he said let remain concealed here while you shall see her again only give when he explained that he would make rosabella s likeness from memory the sorrowing parent shook his head and sighed he answered ah my son the soul in her eye and the light grace of her motions art can but to pierre s excited imagination there was henceforth only one object in life and that was to rosabella in the keen conflict of competition under the fiery stimulus of love and ambition his strong impetuous soul had become and now overwhelming grief centered all his stormy energies on one object day by day in the loneliness of his garret he worked upon the image till he came to love it almost much he had loved the maiden herself antoine breguet readily supplied materials from childhood he had been interested in all forms of mechanism and this image so intertwi ned with his affections took strong hold of his imagination also nearly year had passed away when the housekeeper who was in the secret came to ask rosabella s hair and the dress she usually wore the old man gave her the keys and wiped the starting tears he turned silently away few days after pierre invited him to come and look upon his work not go too suddenly he said prepare yourself shock indeed it is very like our lost i will go i will go replied the old man eagerly am i not accustomed to see all manner of automata and androides did i not myself make which performed sixteen tunes to the admiration of all who heard him and think you i am to be frightened by an image not frightened dear father answered pierre but i was afraid you might be overcome with he led him into the apartment and said shall i remove the veil now can you bear it dear father i can was the calm reply but when the curtain was withdrawn he started and exclaimed santa maria it is rosabella she is not dead he tottered forward and kissed the cold lips and the cold hands and tears rained on the bright brown hair he cried out my child my child 158 159 160 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https the tumult of feeling had subsided the aged mourner kissed pierre s hands and said it is wonderfully like her in every feature and every tint it seems if it would move and she will move and breathe replied pierre only give time his voice sounded so wildly and his great eyes burned with such intense enthusiasm that his friend was alarmed they clasped each other s hands and spoke more quietly of the beloved one this is all that remains to us pierre said the old man we are alone in the world you were friendless orphan when you came to and i am with passionate outburst of grief the young man replied and it was i my benefactor who made you so wretch that i am from that time the work went on with greater zeal than ever pierre often forgot to taste of food so absorbed was he in the perfection of his machine first the arms moved obedient to his wishes then the eyes turned and the lips parted meanwhile his own face grew thinner and paler and his eyes glowed with wilder fire finally it was whispered in the village that pierre berthoud was concealed in antoine breguet s cottage and officers came to arrest him but the venerable old er told the story so touchingly and painted so strongly the young man s consuming agony of grief and remorse and pleaded so earnestly that he might be allowed to finish wonderful image of his beautiful grandchild that they promised not to disturb him till the work was accomplished two years from the day of pierre s return on the anniversary of the memorable he said now my father i have done all that art can come and see the beautiful he led him into the little room where rosabella used to work there she sat spinning dilige ntly the beautifully formed bust rose and fell under her neat boddice her lips were parted and her eyes followed the direction of the thread but what made it seem more fearfully like life was the fact that ever and anon the wheel rested and the maiden held the suspended thread with her lowered if she were lost in thought above the flower near by hung the with florien s artificial canary the pretty little automaton had been silent long but now its springs were set in motion and it poured forth all its melodies the bereaved old man pressed pierre s hand and gazed upon his darling silently he caused his to be brought into the room and ever after while he retained his faculties he refused to sit elsewhere the fame of this remarkable android soon spread through all the region round about the citizens of geneva united in an earnest petition that the artist might be excused from any penalty the accidental murder he had committed members of the state council came and looked at the breathing maiden and touched the beautiful flesh which seemed if it would yield to their pressure they saw the wild haggard artist with lines of suffering cut so deeply in his youthful brow and they at once granted the prayer of the citizens but pierre had nothing more to live his work in the world was done the artificial energy supplied by one absorbing idea was gone and the contemplation of his own work was driving him to madness it so closely resembled life that he longed more and more to have it live the lustrous eyes moved but they had light from the soul and they would not answer to his earnest gaze the beautiful lips parted but they never spoke kind words in days of yore the image began to fill him with supernatural awe yet he was continually drawn toward it by magic influence three months after its completion he was found at daylight lying at its feet stone dead antoine breguet survived him two years during the first eighteen months he was never willing to have the image of his lost darling out of sight the latter part of the time he often whistled to the bird and talked to her and seemed to imagine that she answered him but with increasing imbecility rosabella was forgotten he sometimes asked who is that young woman at last he said send her away she looks at the of departing memory then presented phantom of his wife dead long ago he busied himself with making imaginary watches and rings her and held long conversations if she were present afterward the wife was likewise forgotten and he was occupied entirely with his mother and the scenes of early childhood finally he wept often and repeated continually they are all waiting and i want

about at school there would be some fun in it replied alfred if it turned all it touched into gold i could peel off the bark and buy horse with ernest gazed silently at the golden sea of clouds in the west and then at the warm gleams it cast on the old walnut tree he stood thus but moment his companion aimed nut at his head and shouted make haste to fill the basket you lazy fellow the nuts were soon gathered and the boys stretched themselves on the grass talking over school affairs flock of birds flew over their heads towards the south they are flying away from winter 166 167 the project

nearer and nearer he perceived lovely little face with tender luminous eyes her robe seemed like glancing in the sun and in her bonnet made of an inverted white petunia blossom the little ringlets shone like finest threads of gold the stamen of white lily served her wand and she held it towards him saying in tones of soft beseechment let touch your eyes you had better touch my wand you will find it much more to the purpose croaked the dwarf under the walnut root look here wouldn t you like to have this and he shook purse full of coins he spoke i don t like your cold eyes and your skinny fingers replied ernest pray who are you my name is utouch answered the gnome and i bring great luck wherever i and what is your name dear little spirit of the air asked ernest she looked lovingly into his eyes and answered my name is touchu shall i be your friend life he smiled and eagerly replied oh yes oh yes your face is so full of love she descended gracefully and touched his eyes with her the air became redolent with delicate perfume like fragrant violets kissed by the soft south wind rainbow arched the heavens and reflected its beautiful image on mirror of mist the old tree reached forth friendly arms and cradled the sunbeams on its bosom flowers seemed to nod and smile at ernest if they knew him very well and the little birds sang into his inmost soul presently he felt that he was rising slowly and undulating on the air like winged seed when it is breathed upon and away he sailed on fleecy clouds under the arch of the rainbow mocking laugh roused him from his trance and he heard utouch the gnome exclaim jeeringly there he goes on voyage to one of his in the moon then he felt himself falling through the air and all at once he was on the ground birds flowers rainbows all were gone twilig ht had deepened into dreary evening winds sighed through the trees and the crickets kept up their mournful creaking tones ernest was afraid to be all alone he felt round his companion and shook him by the arm exclaiming alfred alfred wake up i have had wonderful fine dream here on the so have i replied alfred rubbing his eyes why need you wake just the old fellow was dropping purse full of money into my hand what old fellow inquired ernest he called himself utouch answered alfred and he promised to be my constant companion i hope he will keep his word i like an old chap that drops purse of gold into my hand when i ask why i dreamed of that same old fellow said ernest but i didn t like his perhaps he didn t show you the full purse said alfred yes he did replied ernest but i felt such love the little fairy with tender eyes and melting voice that i choose her my and oh she made the earth so beautiful his companion laughed and said i dreamed of her too so you have preferred that floating did you i should have guessed much but come help carry the nuts home i am hungry my supper years passed and the boys were men ernest sat writing in small chamber that looked toward the setting sun his little child had hung prismatic chandelier on the window and he wrote amid the rainbows that it cast over his paper in simple vase on his desk stood stalk of blossoms 168

himself gone are the dandelion blossoms whic h strewed my with golden stars and now come these winged flowers to refresh the eye when they are gone to warmer climes then will the yellow butterflies

chamber was filled with the delicate perfume of its blossoms sound broke the sabbath stillness except the little bird in the althea bush whose tones were sad the voice of memory the child heard it and sighed unconsciously he put his little feverish hand within his mother s and said please sing hymn dear mother with soft clear voice subdued by her depth of feeling she sang schubert s ave maria manifold and wonderful are the intertwining influences in the world of spirits what was it that touched the little bird s heart and uttered itself in such plaintive cadences they made the child sigh hymn and bird and child together woke schubert s prayerful echoes in the mother s bosom and now from the soul of the composer in that german land the spirit of devotion comes to the father wafted on the wings of that beautiful music ernest bowed his head reverently and sank kneeling by the while he listened thus touchu glided softly into his bosom and laid her wand upon his heart when the sweet beseeching melody had ceased ernest pressed the hand of the singer to his lip and remained awhile in silence then the strong necessity of supplication came over him and he poured forth an ardent prayer with fervid eloquence he implored themselves an humble and resigned spirit and their little one that living or dying good angels might ever carry him in their 171 172 173 174 the project

wall and pillar and imparted to silk and broadcloth the metallic lustre of peacock s plumage gorgeous in crimson mantle with topaz glory round his head shone the meek son of joseph the carpenter and his humble fishermen of galilee were refulgent in robes of purple and gold the fine haze of dust on which the sunbeams fell gleamed with quivering prismatic reflection of their splendour from the choir descended the heavenly tones of schubert s ave maria they flowed into alfred s ear but touchu was with him to lay her wand upon his heart to visitor who sat in his cushioned pew he whispered that they paid the highest price their music and had the best that money could command the sermon urged the necessity of providing some religious instruction the poor otherwise there could be security to property against robbery and fire alfred resolved within himself to get up subscription immediately that purpose and to give twice much duncan whatev er the sum might be utouch who had secretly suggested the thing to him turned somersaults on the gilded prayer and twisted diabolical grimaces but alfred did not see him nor did he hear laugh under the carriage when they rolled home he said to his wife my dear why didn t you wear your embroidered shawl i told you we were to have strangers in the pew in so handsome church people expect to see the congregation elegantly dressed you know but though utouch was mocking spirit alfred could not complain that he had been untrue to his bargain he had promised to bestow any thing he craved from his kingdom of the outward he had asked honour in the church influence at the exchange rich handsome wife and superb horses he had them all whose fault was it that he was continually looking round anxiously to observe whether others had more of the goods he coveted he had wished luxurious table and it stood covered with the rarest dainties of the world but with constrained smile he said to his guests is it not provoking to be surrounded with luxuries i can not eat that would torment my sleep with legion of night mares it is true i not crave it much i sit at loaded table an appetite the witty madame sevign√© used to say again and again he asked himself why all the fruit that seemed so ripe and tempting on the outside was always dry and dusty within and if he was puzzled to understand why he seemed to have all things and yet really had nothing still more was he puzzled to explain how ernest seemed to have so little and yet in reality possessed all things one evening at concert he happened to sit near ernest and his wife while they listened to the beautiful symphony by spohr called the consecration of the tones delighted children were they when they began to hear the winds murmur through the music the insects pipe and one little bird after another chirp his notes of gladness how expressively they looked at each other during the tender lulling and how the expression of their faces brightened and softened the enchanting tones passed through the lively alleg ro of the dance into the exquisite melody of the serenade but when dance and serenade all moved forward together in delightful harmony chord of lovely melodies the transparent countenance of ernest became luminous with his inward joy it was evident that touchu had again laid her thrilling wand upon his heart how the deuce does he contrive always to delight himself thought alfred i wonder whether the music really is any thing in order to ascertain he turned from ernest to watch the countenance of musical critic near by one of those unfortunate men who enjoy music the enjoys the poetry he corrects in fice how can beautiful metaphor please him while he sees comma or period out of place how can he be charmed by the melodious flow of the verse while he is dotting an i or looking out an inverted s the critic seemed less attentive to his business than the reader he was looking round and whispering apparently unconscious that sweet sounds filled the air nevertheless utouch whispered to alfred that the critic was the man to inform him whether he ought to be delighted with the music or not so at the close of the symphony he spoke to him 175 176 177

fine one but he has doubtless heard it in paris and until you have heard french orchestra sir you can have conception of music their accuracy in rhythmical time amounts to absolute and you think the orchestra have played well tolerably well sir but in the the clarionet lagged little once or twice and the effect of the serenade was injured because the violoncello was tuned of note too alfred bowed and went away congratu lating himself that he had not been more delighted than was proper the alleged impossibility of having any conception of music unless he went to europe renewed wish he had long indulged he closed his magnificent house and went forth to make the fashionable tour ernest was painter well poet and it chanced that they met in italy alfred seemed glad to see the friend of his childhood but he soon turned from cheerfu l things to tell how vexed he was about statue he had purchased i gave great price it said he thinking it was real antique but good judges now assure that it is modern work it is so annoying to waste one s money but if it be really beautiful and pleases you the money is not wasted replied ernest though it certainly is not agreeable to be cheate look at this ivory head to my cane it is bust of hebe which i bought trifle yesterday but small is the market value its beauty is perpetual delight to if it be not an antique it deserves to be it troubles that i cann ot find the artist and pay him more than i gave it perhaps he is poor and has not yet made name himself but whoever he may be spark of the divine fire is certainly in him observe the beautiful swell of the breast and the graceful turn of the head yes it is pretty thing rejoined alfred half contemptously but i am too much vexed with that knave who sold the statue to go into raptures about the head of cane just now what makes it more provoking is that duncan purchased real antique last year less money than i threw away on this modern having in vain tried to impart his own sunny humour ernest bade him adieu and returned to his humble lodgings out of the city he lingered in the listening to the nightingales he thought to himself i wish that charming little fairy who came to in my boyish dream would touch alfred with her wand the purse the old gnome gave him seems to bring him little he happened to look up at the moment and there close by his hand was touchu balancing herself toe on an she had the same luminous loving eyes the same prismatic robe and the same sunny gleam on her hair she smiled she said then you not repent your early choice though i could not give you purse full of money oh indeed replied he thou hast been the brightest blessing of my she kissed his eyes and waving her wand over him said affectionately take then the best gift i have to of fer

exultation was worn copy of goldsmith s manners and customs the declared that it was adorned with plates but readers accustomed to the present more beautiful style of publish ing would have been slow to admit that the straight lank figures daubed with engraver s ink were any ornament to the volumes to the unpractised eyes of john and his sister they were however gems of art and the manner in which they were obtained greatly increased their value the children had received cake and two little chickens from neighbour in payment picking cranberries never did chickens give rise to such extensive speculations not even the imaginary brood of the famous the chickens would become hens and the hens would lay eggs and brown who drove the would sell the eggs and there were ever so many books in boston and who could guess what wonderful stories they would buy with their eggs the vision was realized in due time the chicke ns did become hens and laid eggs and brown listened to john s request to sell them and buy book that had pictures in it and told about countries way goldsmith s manners and customs came the fruit of these instructions and was hailed with an outburst of joy most boys would have chosen to buy marbles or drum but john s earliest passion had been book the subtle influences which organize temperaments and produce character are not easily traced his intellectual activity certainly was not derived from either of his parents they were mere healthy sluggish animals but there was tradition in the neighbourhood that his maternal grandmother was an extraordinary woman in her day that few folks knew so much she did and if her husband had been half smart and calculating they would have been very people the children of the extraordinary woman inherited her husband s inert temperament but her own energetic character in her grandchildren and they had the good fortune to be born in new england where the moral atmosphere stimulates intellect and the stream of knowledge flows free and full to all the people esther was eager information her more vivacious brother and though woman her pathway of life was more obstructed and all its growth more stinted she helped to lead him into broader avenues than she herself was allowed to enter being two years older than he it was her delight to teach him the alphabet soon he could speak and great was her satisfaction when he knew all the letters in her little old primer and could recite the couplet that belonged to each they conveyed very distinct idea to his mind but esther s praise made him very vain of this accomplishment dozen times day he shouted the whole all in row and was quite out of breath when he arrived at zaccheus he did climb tree his lord to see the mother who was kindly but dull woman took little interest in their childish scrambling after literature but she sent them to the the sake of having them out of the way and she was somewhat proud that her children could read she called it earlier than neighbours of the same age one day when the minister of the village called she told john to bring his book about manners and customs and let the minister hear how well they could read the good old man was much pleased with the bright boy and his intelligent motherly sister when their mother told him the story of the eggs he patted them on the head and said that s right my children you can t be too fond of your books they are the best friends in the world if you ask them they will tell you about every thing this remark uttered in very serious tone made deep impression that evening brother and sister sat on the eating their supper of bread and milk the sun set bright and clear after transient shower and beautiful rainbow arched the entire heavens oh esther look at that pretty rainbow exclaimed john ah see see now there are two of he gazed at the beautiful phenomenon with all his soul in his eyes and added soon we have eggs enough we will get brown to buy book that tells how rainbows are made and where they come esther replied that she did wish the hens would lay three eggs day when the was commissioned to purchase another volume he declared himself unable to find one that told where rainbows came from in lieu thereof he brought bruce s travels and an unfailing source of entertainment it proved thus month by month their little library increased and their intellectual craving grew fast by the food it fed on they gathered berries picked chips ran on errands rose early and worked late to accumulate sixpences 182 183 184 185

paul says truly wealth bears far heavier on talent than poverty under gold mountains and thrones who knows how many spiritual giant may lie crushed down and buried esther and her brother were troubled with ambitious conjectures whether or not they could ever become spiritual giants they simply felt that the acquisition of knowledge was present delight they thought little of hats and shoes till father and mother said these must be bought with portion of their wages but after that they were doubly careful of their hats and often carried their shoes in their hands thus were they in their unconscious earnestness living according to laws which highest reason would prescribe the whole social fabric they worked industriously at manual labor but always with spiritual end in view and that spiritual end was their own chosen recreation they practised the most careful economy but it was neither mean nor painful because it was noble use not the mere sake of accumulation though the poor parents were oblige d to appropriate portion of the children s juvenile earnings there was one little fund that was entirely their own the two chickens had progeny of chickens and these in process of time likewise laid eggs john picked up every stray grain of oats he could find because he had heard it was good kind of food to increase eggs and busy little esther saved all the oyster shells she could find to pound the hens in winter when there was gravel to furnish material the shells the cackling of hen was to them an important event esther smiled at her knitting she heard it and john he plucked the weeds raised up his head to listen hens have been often laughed at proclaiming all abroad that another egg is in the world but john s brood had right to crow over their mission cackle away to thy heart s content thou brown little feather never mind their jibes and jeers thy human superiors often become famous by simply obeying an impulse which uncon sciously to themselves evolves extensive and progressive good and thou art not the first prattling egotist who has worked far higher results than he had the ability to comprehend let him who laughs at thy cackling measure if he can

uttered may not that individu al thought pervade and modify the entire opinion of society and is not law the mere record of aggregate opinion truly the cackling hen brought such thoughts to simple esther and her brother john to them it merely announced that another egg was laid and thereby another cent gained toward the purchase of new book they talked the stories over by the light of the moon or recited to each other favorite passages from burns and bloomfield when the took their noon rest you would be sure to find john hidden away in the shade of haystack devouring book his zeal attracted the minister s attention and he often stopped to talk with him one day he said to the mother this boy will make something extraordinary he must get an education he must go to college ma bless my heart i might well think of sending him to the moon she replied but esther heard it with quick blush of pleasure and pride and henceforth the one absorbing thought of her life was how to assist in sending john to college busily she calculated how much could be earned in two years by knitting and binding shoes and braiding straw john listened with rapture to her plans but his triumph was checked midway by the recollection that his sister could not go to college with him why esther you have always been my teacher he said you learn faster than i and you remember better why don t women go to college they couldn t be lawyers and ministers and judges if they did answered esther why not said john esther s knowledge and reflection on the subject stopped there and she simply replied that women never had done such things why yes they have said john the bible says that deborah was judge and queen elizabeth was more than judge and we read the other day that isabella of spain knew how to direct an army and govern the state better than her husband king ferdinand i am sure i don t see why women shouldn t go to 186 187 188 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https boy in the eagerness of brotherly love had started ideas which he was too ignorant to follow but in his simple question lies the germ of thoughts that will revolutionize the world surely there is god of harmony in the universe so surely will woman one day become the acknowledged equal and of man in every department of life and yet be more truly gentle and af fectionate than she now is but esther was too young to reflect on such matters she loved her brother and she wanted him to go to college and with unquestioning diligence she applied her faculties to the purpose in every way that was left open her she scarcely allowed herself time to eat and sleep and grudged herself every article of apparel so zealous was her sisterly love poor girl there was one to teach her the physical laws and she knew not that toiling thus perpetually without exercise the body or recreation the mind was slow suicide month after month she laboured and seldom spoke of pains in her side and confused feelings in her head even her favourite luxury of reading was almost entirely relinquished and john had little leisure to read to her such books were entertaining the minister had offered to hear him recite latin and greek once week and he was too busy with the classics to have time voyages and travels he often repeated his lessons to his sister and from his bald translations she here and there gleaned few ideas but this kind of mental effort was little profitable and less enlivening blessed nature stood ever ready to refresh and strengthen her the golden dandelion blossoms smiled brightly in her face and the trees stretched their friendly arms over her in blessing but she had time to listen to their kind voices it would have been difficult to lure her aside from her arduous path even if she had known that it would lead to an open tomb when an object is pursued with such concentrated aim and persevering effort it is almost always attained john taught school in the winters and worked at whatever his hand could find to in the summers esther hoarded all her earning s to add to the education fund they called it and their good friend the minister borrowed hundred dollars them to be repaid according to their own convenience at last the darling hope of many years was realized john went to college and soon ranked among the best scholars of his class his sister still toiled that he might have sufficiency of books and clothing he studied hard and taught school during college vacations and returned home at the end of four years attenuated almost to skeleton the new milk and the breath of the cows and the verdure of the fields refreshed him and in some degree restored his exhausted strength but now he was fretted with the question what to with the education he had acquired with so much hardship an additional expenditure of time and money was required to fit him either of the professions he was not stimulated by any strong preference either of them and his generous soul resisted the idea of taxing his sister s strength any further his own advantage the old question of his boyhood returned with additional force why should she with her noble nature and admirable faculties be forever penned up within the small routine of petty cares and mere mechanical efforts why should she not share his destiny and enjoy with him more expansive atmosphere soul and body to this end he resolved to labour he would earn money by the readiest means that offered and devote his earnings to her improvement but esther said if you educate dear john what can i with my education i can nothing but teach school and that i am sure my health is not adequate the doctor says i must take much exercise the doctor exclaimed john why esther you never told you had been ill enough to consult it is merely slight difficulty in my lungs she replied i am going to spin on the great wheel this winter and i think that will cure not trouble your kind heart about my dear john while i have any health and strength i will never consent to be burden upon you however much you may urge it i not believe that sisters ought to depend on brothers support i am sure it is far better the characters of women to rely on their own energies but some times i think we have not fair chance in the world i often wish you that it was easy us to obtain more liberal education and customary to use that education in freer scope all our faculties but never mind dear brother the door of your cage is open and the world is all before you go where you will i know you will never forget the sister who loves you so dearly you are destine d to go far ahead of in life but your good heart will never allow you to be ashamed of your poor untutored esther john folded her close to his heart and turned away to hide the gathering tears he was more than ever desirous to something the high culture of that generous and affectionate soul the way to earn moderate income was soon opened to him the widowed sister of one of the college professors wanted private tutor her sons and john golding was recommended by her brother 189 190 191 192 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https he came in contact the first time with the outward refinements of life charming music harmonious colours elegant furniture and above all the daily conversation of cultivated woman breathed their gentle and refining influen ces over his strong and honest soul at first he was shy and awkward but the kindly atmosphere around him gradually unfolded the sleeping flower within and without thinking of the process the scholar became gentleman by careful economy he repaid esther the sums she had advanced his education but the question was forever renewed how he should manage to have her share his advantages without sacrificing her noble spirit of independence his visits to the old homestead reminded him sometimes little painfully that he was leaving his family far behind him in the career of knowledge and refinement his father chewed tobacco without much regard to cleanliness his kind old mother would cut the butter with the same knife she had used in eating she had done so all her life but he had never before noticed it and it vexed him to the heart to find himself so much annoyed by it now his serious gentle sister was endowed with an unusual degree of natural refinement which is usually better teacher of manners than mere conventional politeness but once when he brought home one of his pupils she came out to meet them dressed in new gown of dingy blue and with figures large enough curtains he blushed and was moment ashamed of her then he reproached himself that his darling esther could seem to him in any respect vulgar the next week he sent her dress of delicate material and quiet colours and she had tact enough to perceive that this was silent mode of improving her taste the most painful thing connected with his own superior culture was the spiritual distance it produced between him and his honest parents their relative positions were reversed father and mother looked up with wondering deference to their children like hens that have hatched ducks they knew not what to make of their progeny thus launching out on fluid element which they had never tried but he perceived the distance between them far more clearly than they could he could receive the whole of their thought but was constantly obliged to check the utterance of his own from consciousness that allusions the most common to him would be quite unintelligible to them the butterfly may remember the grub but the grub has knowledge of the butterfly with esther he had unalloyed pleasure of compani onship though ignorant of the world and deficient in culture she was an intelligent listener and it charmed him to see her grow continually under the influence of the sunshine he could bring to her how he loved to teach her how he longed to prove his gratitude by the consecration of all his faculties and means to her use in little more than year after he left college delightful change came over his prospects brother of the widow in whose family he had been tutor was appointed ambassador to spain and through her influence he selected john golding his private secretary esther true to her unselfish nature urged him by all means to accept the offer when you were little boy said she you were always eager to know about countries great way off but we little thought then that our cackling hens would ever bring you such golden opportunity john s satisfaction would have been complete if he could have taken esther with him to that balmy clime but she had many objections to offer she said her rustic manners unfitted her the elegant circles in which he would move and he replied that she would catch the tone of polished society far more readily than he could she reminded him that their parents needed his assistance to repair the old dilapidated homestead and to purchase cows and that he had promised to devote to their use the first money he could spare he sighed and made answer he felt that his pecuniary resources were altogether inadequate to his generous wishes again the question returned why can not women go abroad and earn their own way in the world well men the coming ages answered him but he did not hear the prophecy at last the hour of parting came painful it was to both but far more painful to esther the young man went forth to seek novelty and adventure the young woman remained alone in the dull monotony of an uneventful life and more than this she felt mournful certainty that she should never behold her darling brother again while he was cheered by hopes of happy reunion and was forever building the most romantic castles in she never told him how very ill she was and he thought her interrupted breath was caused merely by the choking emotions of an ged heart he deposited with friend more money than he could have prevailed upon her to accept and made choice collection of books and engravings to cheer her during his absence to the last moment he spoke of coming her next year and carrying her to the sunny hills of spain with faint smile she promised to learn spanish that she might be able to talk with her brother don 193 194 195 196 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https and so with mutual struggle to suppress their tears the brother and sister who had gone so lovingly hand in hand over the rough paths of life parted just where the glancing summit of his hopes rose bright before him letter written on board ship was full of cheerful visions of the quiet literary home they would enjoy together in the coming years the next letter announced his arrival in spain oh the romantic old castles the picturesque mills the rich vineyards the glowing oranges the great swelling bunches of grapes he was half wild with enthusiasm and seemed to have annoyance except the fact that he could not speak modern languages i ought not said he to complain of the which we toiled so hard and which has certainly opened the closed gateway of far nobler life than i could probably have entered by any other means but after all dear esther much of my time and money was spent what i can not bring into use and shall therefore soon get even my latin was not taught in way that enables to talk freely with the learned foreigners i meet by the light of my present experience i can certainly devise better plan of education my son if i ever have one meanwhile dear sister not work too hard and pray study french

beauty till thou seest them here think of seeing the alhambra with its golden and flowery arabesques above all imagine thyself seated under leaning on the bosom of thy ever brother poor esther this description of genial climate made her sigh while she read it the cold east winds of new england were cutting her wounded lungs like dagger but when she answered the precious letter she made allusion to this she wrote playfully concerning the health of the cows and the hens asked him to inform her what was cackle in spanish she reverenced the word and would fain know it in all languages finally she assured him that she was studying busily to make herself ready to reside in the grand castle he was building the tears came to her eyes she folded the letter but she turned hastily aside that they might not drop on the paper never in her life had she been willing to let her shadow cross his sunshine it was the last letter she ever wrote she had sought to crown her brother with laurels on earth and his ministering angel crowned her with garlands in heaven three years afterwards john stood by her humble grave in his native village the tears flowed fast he thought to himself and i once blushed

were soon repeated to reuben he brought an action slander and recovered cents provoked at the laugh this occasioned he watched joe to pass by and set his big dog upon him screaming furiously call an

adjoining reuben the estate had been much neglected and had caught thistles and mullein from the neighbouring fields but simeon was diligent man blessed by nature with healthy organization and genial tempera ment and wise and kind education had aided nature in the perfection of her goodly work his provident industry soon changed the aspect of things on the farm river autumn leaves old shoes and

fondling her calf under the great walnut tree walked up to him with serious friendly face asking the slice of sugar he was wont to give her chanticleer strutting about with his troop of plump hens and downy little chickens took trouble to keep out of his way but flapped his glossy wings and crowed welcome in his very face when simeon turned his steps homeward the boys threw up their caps and ran

satisfaction everybody loves my husba nd that knows him they can t help simeon green s acquaintance knew that he was never engaged in in his life but they predicted that he would find it impossible to

reuben he said more but his tightly compressed mouth had such significant expression that his dog dodged him he would the track of tiger that very night reuben turned his horse into the highway in hopes he would commit some depredations on neighbour green s premises but joe smith seeing the animal at large let down the bars of reuben s own and the poor beast walked in and feasted he had not done many year it would have been great satisfaction to reuben if he could have brought lawsuit against his horse but it was he was obliged to content himself with beating him his next exploit was to shoot mary green s handsome chanticleer because he stood on the stone wall and crowed in the ignorant joy of his heart two inches beyond the frontier line that bounded the contiguous farms simeon said he was sorry the poor bird and sorry because his wife and children liked the pretty creature but otherwise it was great matter he had been intending to build poultry yard with good high fence that his hens might not annoy his neighbours and now he was admonished to make haste and it he would build them snug warm house to roost in they should have plenty of gravel and oats and room to promenade back and forth and crow and cackle to their heart s content there they could enjoy themselves and be out of harm s way but reuben black had degree of ingen uity and perseverance which might have produced great results mankind had those qualities been devoted to some more noble purpose than provoking quarrels pear tree in his garden very improperly stretched over friendly arm into simeon green s premises whether the sunny state of things there had cheering effect on the tree i know not but it happened that this bough bore more abundant fruit and glowed with richer hue than the other boughs one day little geor ge green he went whistling along picked up pear that had fallen into his father s garden the instant he touched it he felt something on the back of his neck like the sting of wasp it was reuben black s whip followed by such storm of angry words that the poor child rushed into the house in an agony of terror but this experiment failed also the boy was soothed by his mother and told not to go near the pear tree again and there the matter ended this imperturbable good nature vexed reuben more than all the tricks and taunts he met from others evil efforts he could understand and repay with compound interest but he did not know what to make of this perpetual forbearance it seemed to him there must be something contemptuous in it he disliked simeon green more than all the rest of the town put together because he made him feel so uncomfortably in the wrong and did not afford him the slightest pretext complaint it was annoying to see every thing in his neighbour s domains looking so happy and presenting such bright contrast to the forlornness of his own when their wagons passed each other on the road it seemed if simeon s horse tossed his head higher and flung out his mane if he knew he was going by reuben black s old nag he often said he supposed green covered his house with roses and honeysuckles on purpose to shame his bare walls but he didn t he he wasn t going to be fool enough to rot his boards with such stuff but one resented his disparaging remarks or sought to provoke him in any way the roses smiled the horse neighed and the calf capered but none of them had the least idea they were insulting reuben black even the dog had malice in his heart though he did one night chase home his geese and bark at them through the bars reuben told his master the next day he swore he woul d bring an action against him if he didn t keep that dog at home and simeon answered very quiet ly that he would try to take better care of him several days strict watch was kept in hopes towzer would worry the geese again but they paced home undisturbed and not solitary furnished excuse the new neighbours not only declined quarrelling but they occasionally made positive advances towards friendly relation simeon s wife sent black large basket full of very fine cherries pleased with the unexpected attention she cordially replied tell your mother it was very kind of her and i am very much obliged to reuben who sat smoking in the listened to this message once without any manifes tation of impatience except whiffing the smoke through his 208 209 210 211 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https little faster and fiercer than usual but when the boy was going out of the door and the friendly words were again repeated he exclaimed don t make fool of yourself peg they want to give us hint to send basket of our pears that s the upshot of the business you may send basket when they are ripe i scorn to be under obligation especially to your poor peggy whose arid life had been the moment refreshed with little dew of kindness admitted distrust into her bosom and the halo that radiated round the ripe glowing cherries departed not long after this advance towards good neighbourhood some labourers employed by simeon green passing over bit of marshy ground with heavy team stuck fast in bog occasioned by long continued rain the poor oxen were entirely unable to extricate themselves and simeon ventured to ask assistance from his waspish neighbour who was working at short distance reuben replied gruffly i ve got enough to to attend to my own the civil request that he might be allowed to use his oxen and chains few moments being answered in the same surly tone simeon silently walked of f in search of more obliging neighbour the men who were left waiting with the patient suffering oxen scolded about reuben s nature and said they hoped he would get stuck in the same bog himself their employer rejoined if he does we will our duty and help him there is such thing being too said they if reuben black takes the notion that people are afraid of him it makes him trample on them worse than ever oh wait while replied green smiling i will kill him before long wait and see if i don t kill it chanced soon after that reuben s team did stick fast in the same bog the workmen had wished simeon observed it from neighbouring field and gave directions that the oxen and chains should be immediately conveyed to his assistance the men laughed shook their heads and said it was good enough the old hornet they however cheerfully proceeded to their employer had requested you are in bad situation neighbour said simeon he came alongside of the foundered team but my men are coming with two yoke of oxen and i think we shall soon manage to help you you may take your oxen back again replied reuben i don t want any of your in very friendly tone simeon answered i can not consent to that eveni ng is coming on and you have very little time to lose it is bad job any time but it will be still worse in the dark light or dark i don t ask your help replied reuben emphatically i would nt help you out of the bog the other day when you asked the trouble i had in relieving my poor oxen teaches to sympathize with others in the same situation answered simeon don t let us waste words about it neighbour it is impossible to go home and leave you here in the bog and night coming the team was soon drawn out and simeon and his men went away without waiting thanks when reuben went home that night he was unusually silent and thoughtful after smoking while in deep contemplation he gently knocked the ashes from his pipe and said with sigh peg simeon green has killed what you mean said his wife dropping her knitting with look of surprise you know when he first came into this neighbourhood he said he d kill replied reuben and he has done it the other day he asked to help draw his team out of the bog and i told him i had enough to to attend to my own business my team stuck fast in the same bog and he came with two yoke of oxen to draw it out i felt sort of ashamed to have him lend hand so i told him i didn t want any of his help but he answered just pleasant if nothing contrary had ever happened that night was coming on and he was not willing to leave there in the mud it was very good of him replied peggy he is man and always has pretty word to say to the boys his wife seems to be nice neighbourly body reuben made answer but after meditating while he remarked peg you know that big ripe melon down at the bottom of the garden you may well carry it over there in the his wife said she would without asking him to explain where over there was but when the morning came reuben walked back and forth and round and round with that sort of aimless activity often manifested by hens and by fashionable idlers who feel restless and don t know what to run after at length the cause of his uncertain movements was explained by his 212 213 214 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https in the form of question i guess i may well carry the melon myself and thank him his oxen in my flurry down there in the marsh i did nt think to say i was obliged to he marched off toward the garden and his wife stood at the door with one hand on her hip and the other shading the sun from her eyes to see if he really would carry the melon into simeon green s house it was the most remarkable incident that had happened since her marriage she could hardly believe her own eyes he walked quick if afraid he should not be able to carry the unusual impulse into action if he stopped to reconsider the question when he found himself in green s house he felt extremely awkward and hastened to say mrs green here is melon my wife sent you and we reckon it s ripe without manifesting any surprise at such unexpected courtesy the friendly matron thanked him and invited him to sit down but he stood playing with the latch of the door and without raising his eyes said may be mr green ain t in this morning he is at the pump and will be in directly she replied and before her words were spoken the honest man walked in with face fresh and bright june morning he stepped right up to reuben shook his hand cordially and said i am glad to see you neighbour take chair take chair thank you i can t stop replied reuben he pushed his hat on one side rubbed his head looked out of the window and then said suddenly if by desperate effort the fact is green i didn t behave right about the never mind never mind replied green perhaps i shall get into the bog again some of these rainy days if i i shall know whom to call why you see said reuben still very much confused and avoiding simeon s mild clear eye you see the neighbors about here are very ugly if i had always lived by such neighbours you are i shouldn t be just i ah well we must try to be to others what we want them to be to us rejoined simeon you know the good book says so i have learned by experience that if we speak kind words we hear kind echoes if we try to make others happy it fills them with wish to make us happy perhaps you and i can bring the neighbourhood round in time who knows let us try black let us try but come and look at my orchard i want to show you tree which i have grafted with very choice apples if you like i will procure you some scions from the same they went into the orchard together and friendly chat soon put reuben at his ease when he returned home he made remarks about his visit he could not yet summon sufficient greatness of soul to tell his wife that he had confessed himself in the wrong gun stood behind the kitchen door in readiness to shoot green s dog having barked at his horse he now fired the contents into the air and put the gun away in the barn from that day hencefo rth he never sought any pretext to quarrel with either the dog or his master short time after joe smith to his utter astonishment saw him pat towzer on the head and heard him say good fellow simeon green was far too magnanimous to repeat to any one that his quarrelsome neighbour had confessed himself to blame he merely smiled he said to his wife i thought we should kill him after joe smith did not believe in such doctrines when he heard of the adventures in the marsh he said sim green s fool when he first came here he talked very big about killing folks if they didn t mind their ps and qs but he don t appear to have much spirit worm worm will turn when its trod poor joe had grown more intemperate and more quarrelsome till at last nobody would employ him about year after the memorable incident of the water some one stole several valuable hides from green he did not ment ion the circumstance to any one but his wife and they both had reasons suspecting that joe was the thief the next week the following anonymous advertisement appeared in the newspaper of the county whoever stole lot of hides on friday night the 5th of the present month is hereby informed that the owner has sincere wish to be his friend if poverty tempted him to this false step the owner will keep the whole transaction secret and will gladly put him in the way of obtaining money by means more likely to bring him peace of 215 216 217 this advertisement is literal copy of one actually published and it produced the effects here related 218 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https singular advertisement of course excited good deal of remark there was much debate whether or not the thief would avail himself of the friendly offer some said he would be greenhorn if he did it was manifestly trap to catch him but he who had committed the dishonest deed alone knew whence the benevolent offer came and he knew that simeon green was not man to set traps his fellow creatures few nights afterward timid knock was heard at simeon s door just the family were retiring to rest when the door was open ed joe smith was seen on the steps with load of hides on his shoulder without raising his eyes he said in low humble tone i have brought these back green where shall i put them wait moment till i can get lantern and i will go to the barn with you he replied then you will come in and tell how it happened we will see what can be done green knew that joe often went hungry and had become accustomed to the stimulus of rum she therefore hastened to make hot coffee and brought from the closet some cold meat and pie when they returned from the barn she said i thought you might feel the better little warm supper neighbour joe turned his back toward her and did not speak he leaned his head against the chimney and after momen t s silence he said in choked voice it was the first time i ever stole any thing and i have felt very bad about it i don t know how it is i didn t think once i should ever come to be what i am but i took to quarrelling and then to drinking since i began to go down hill everybody gives kick you are the first man that has offered helping hand my wife is feeble and my children starving you have sent them many meal god bless you and yet i stole the hides from you meaning to sell them the first chance i could get but i tell you the truth mr green it is the first time i ever deserved the name of let it be the last my friend said simeon pressing his hand kindly the secret shall remain between ourselves you are young and can make up lost time come now give promise that you will not drink one drop of intoxicating liquor year and i will employ you at good wages mary will go to see your family early in the morning and perhaps we may find some employment them also the little boy can at least pick up stones but eat bit now and drink some hot coffee it will keep you from wanting to drink any thing stronger you will find it hard to abstain at first joseph but keep up brave heart the sake of your wife and children and it will soon become easy when you feel the need of coffee tell my mary and she will always give it to joe tried to eat and drink but the food seemed to choke him he was nervous and excited after an inef fectual ef fort to compose himself he laid his head on the table and wept like child after while simeon persuaded him to bathe his head in cold water and he ate and drank with good appetite when he went away the host said try to well joseph and you shall always find friend in the poor fellow pressed his hand and replied i understand now how it is you kill bad he entered in green s service the next day and remained in it many years an honest and faithful man intelligence of animals the whole subject of the brute creation is to one of such painful mystery that i dare not approach rnold if we deny them soul we must admit that they have some spirit direct from god what we call unerring instinct which holds the place of sir i saac n ewt on any reflecting person who has lived much in the country and been observant of animals must have had thoughts similar to those expressed in the above mottoes even the smallest and most common animals sometimes give indications of thought feeling and memory almost remarkable those related of the if we could penetrate into the mysteries of their domestic arrangements and learn of the why she makes her little thimble of nest so exactly the color of the tree on which it is placed and of the why he makes his small 219 220 221 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https cell to resemble so closely the stones of the wall where he inserts it we should probably be still more puzzled to define the boundary between instinct and reason several times in my life my attention has been arrested and my mind excited to activity by singular manifestations of intelligence in animals that came under my observation few summers ago when i was living at an old in new york i chanced to go into the garret late in the afternoon the sun was setting in blaze of glory and i knelt at the western window looking out long and lovingly upon the broad expanse of field and meadow on which he was throwing shower of gold he passed away after while my attention was diverted from this beautiful scene by the motions of wasp that emer ged from crevice in the old window and began to nibble off thin soft slivers of the decaying wood to be used in constructing her nest i bent very near to her trying to ascertain by what process she cut up the materials so dexterously suddenly she stopped working drew back little and appeared to watch closely i watched her at first i thought this was delusion of my imagination i supposed her eyes were too small to see so i continued gazing at her waiting to observe what she would she remained motionless in an attitude that expressed surprise and consternation plainly an insect could express them presently another wasp came up from the same crevice and began to nibble at the rotten wood the first wasp immediately put out one of her antenn√¶ and pulled the antenna of her neighbour i would jog the elbow of companion if i wished to call her attention to something extraordinary the second wasp drew back instantly in the same attitude and without stirring appeared to gaze at fixedly third wasp came one of her antenn√¶ was cautiously pulled by the second comer and she did precisely they had done it may seem absurd to say i was troubled by the fixed stare of three wasps but there was something so human about their proceedings that i was troubled i was in the presence of mystery i asked myself what am i to them i appear like vision of some superior being from another world from this thought i came down to the recollection that the sun was gleaming brightly on my eyes and that perhaps their attention had been arrested merely by two great orbs of glittering light what were they thinking of would they finally conclude to attack my eyes i turned away suddenly deeming it imprudent to stay any longer to ascertain that point i was so much impressed by this little incident that i frequently related it to my friends and years afterward i frequently found myself conjecturing what those wasps thought of the apparition by which they were so obviously startled at the same there were two cats tom who was old heavy and cross and mouser who was remarkably active and nimble her hunting qualities were famous throughout the neighbourhood she kept the premises clear of rats and mice and visited all the barns and fields in the vicinity the same purpose while i was there she had three kittens which seemed to be the especial objects of tom s ill nature when they began to open their eyes and stagger about they sometimes stumbled over him which they were sure to receive smart box on the ear more than once i saw his heavy paw knock the little blundering things when they came near him he even kept up threatening growl if they seemed to be approaching from distance things were in this state when mouser came into the kitchen one day writhing and moaning and giving every indication of great pain her body soon began to swell and her manifestations of suffering grew more and more violent the family were remarkably kind to animals and mouser was such valuable creature that they were very desirous to save her life they knew not whether she had been poisoned or kicked by the horse during her frequent visits to the barn and of course they were doubtful what remedies to apply they put her in warm bath and tried to pour catnip tea down her throat but their ef forts were unavailing in an hour or two poor pussy was dead while she was in this agonizing extremity tom seemed to rouse from his usual state of drowsy indifference he lay with his head between his paws watching her earnestly awhile then he rose up and walked round her evidently much disquieted when he saw her lying stiff and cold on the floor he made whining noise but his proceedings seemed to indicate that he knew what had happened the kittens were nestled together on the platform of the old dutch he went out to them and began to lick their fur in the most affectionate manner after that he was never seen to knock them about and never heard to growl at them their own mother could not have treated them with more tenderness or submitted to their gambols with more patience apparently they mistook the gruff old fellow their mother they went to him nourishment and he made resistance again and again i saw him stretched on the floor of the stoop while the kittens appeared to be sucking with all diligence moving their little paws if satisfied and happy this circumstance of course excited surprise in the family one asked another whether it was possible 222 223 224 225 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https they obtained milk or whether they drew blood their sustenance tom never gave any indications of suffering inconvenience from this singular imitation of the mate rnal office he must have nourished them in some way they did not learn to lap milk several days yet they lived and seemed comfortable and thriving after tom took upon himself the care of the orphans he seemed to become really fond of them and to enjoy the frolics that had formerly made him so angry the voluntary exercise of benevolence improved his temper wonderfully the time being and evidently made him much happier cat an intimate friend has often mentioned to incidents that occurred on his farm illustrative of brute sagacity he owned noble great ox uncommonly strong docile and intelligent one day when he and another ox were ploughing swampy land they sank very deep into quagmire having made vigorous exertions to extricate himself and finding the utmost exertion of his strength was ineffectual he quietly waited human aid but his companion had an impatient and irritable disposition to which the lessons of experience could teach wisdom he continued to struggle violently at intervals and every motion wrenched the neck of his suffering the gentle creature bore it patiently while but at last it became insupportable his owner was standing completely behind him leaning on the plough until more help could be brought to draw them out of the slough of despond into which they had fallen the animal turned his long neck slowly round and fixed his large patient eyes upon the man with such an earnes t imploring gaze so human in its expression that it could never be forgotten it said plainly look could say it can you not contrive some way to relieve from this tormenting companion his owner understood the silent appeal and immediately divorced the unhappy couple by removing the yoke from the restless one thus leaving him free to waste his own strength without injuring his more philosophic companion this happened fifteen years ago but i was reminded of it yesterday by hearing my friend utter his exclamation if i live to be hundred years old i shall never get how that ox looked at the same person often speaks of the sagacity manifested by another ox on his farm it was late in the evening and all the animals were safely lodged in the barn when his attention was arrested by loud knocks in that direction they continued to be repeated at intervals of ten or fifteen minutes an hour or more and the idea that some vagrant might be in the barn doing mischief at last induced him to go out with lantern to examine the premises finding nothing unusual he gave up the search and retired to rest but the heavy measured sound continued and excited curiosity to such degree that it was impossible to sleep another examination of the barn was made with the same result before but this time my friend ensconced himself in corner and waited recurrence of the mysterious noise in few minutes he saw an ox raise one of his hind hoofs and strike the floor heavily three times supposing the animal must have some cause dissatisfaction he examined his stable and found that the man had forgotten to furnish the usual supply of fresh straw him to lie down upon his demand clean sheets was comp lied with and more knockings were heard from him another agricultural friend owned colt endowed with uncommon beauty and intelligence he was about year and half old when he first saw string of bells suspended round his mother s neck when she was harnessed drive the novel sound immediately arrested his attention and seemed to enliven him greatly he stood with uplifted ears watching and listening till the sleigh had passed out of sight and hearing then giving snort and rear he capered round the in state of unusual excitement when the mare returned the sound of the bells attracted him from afar and he appeared to observe them closely when they were taken off and laid in the sleigh with the harness soon the man had left them the playful creature seized them between his teeth and trotted up and down the road shaking them with prodigious satisfaction this manner of playing old horse was evidently entertaining to him it is to boy to imitate the trainers with his feathered cap and drum the natural dispositions of animals differ those of mankind but the intelligence and docility of brutes well of human beings is wonderfully increased when they are judiciously reared and treated with habitual kindness it is not easy to tell how far the superiority of arabian horses may be attributed to the affectionate companion ship that exists between them and their masters the whip is detestable instrument the evil it produces is immensely disproportioned to the temporary convenience it promotes it compels submission the time being but it stupefies the intellect and infuses malignity into the disposition whether tried on children slaves or animals the common practice of whipping horse to cure him of being frightened by some particular 226 227 228 229 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https usually has the effect of giving him two causes of fear instead of one i remember reading of much more judicious method in hamilton s essays on education published in england about thirty years ago horse of an excellent disposition had been frightened by drum when he was colt and nothing could overcome his excessive terror of that instrument the whippings he received when he reared and plunged at the sound rendered his associations with it so exceedingly painful that his whole nervous system was excited to violent agitation the instant he heard it approaching he was finally purchased by gentleman who believed more in the efficacy of kindness than he did in coercion he kept him without food till he was hungry and then spread oats on soon he began to eat the groom began to drum the frightened animal ran away and could not be lured back again by the tempting display of provender he was deprived of food still longer time and the experiment was again tried with similar result but the third time hunger proved stronger than fear and he devoured his oats with the hated noise sounding louder and louder in his ears after being thus rationally convinced that drum would him harm he ceased to be troublesome and voluntaril y walked toward the sound which had become so pleasantly associated in his memory if men would educate animals in sensible and patient manner and treat them with habitual gentleness it would produce intelligence and docility apparently miraculous and realize on earth the prophecies of the millenium the w orld that i am passing through 230 231 the project gutenberg

exceedingly acute maria was musical and the moment he heard her piano or guitar he would drop his playthings and run into the parlour there he would creep under the table to be out of the way and sit listening with all his soul shining through the varying expression of his countenance sometimes he was so excited that he would quiver all over and end by clapping his hands with loud crow of delight but more frequently he was moved to tears being general favourite and the especial pet of his young mistress he was seldom ejected from the parlour when he chose to wander there when maria was busy at her embroidery frame if she raised her eyes she would often see his little dark head peeping in watching her to take notice of him and soon she said ah here comes my little brownie he would run to her with jump and bound and stand gazing at the bright colours she was weaving into her work if she was singing or playing when he entered she would give him nod and smile and not unfrequently she seated him in her lap and allowed him to play on the piano his fingers were too short to reach an octave but he would touch thirds continually smiling and laughing and wriggling all over with delight sometimes she amused herself by touching the first and seventh note of the gamut together and then he would cringe if she had put her finger in his eye he was but three years old when his mistress married lambert van der veen and removed with him to near the neighbouring city of gr√©sik little jan did not thoroughly like that gentleman because he was often sent out of the parlour when he came and maria was so engrossed with her lover that she sometimes forgot to nod and smile when little brownie peeped into the room he was very exclusive in his affections he wanted to have those he loved all to himself therefore though the young man spoke kindly to him and often gave him shadow always passed over his expressive face when running eagerly at the sound of the piano he looked into the parlour and saw his rival there but after maria was married he became if possible more of petted plaything than ever her husband was engaged in commercial pursuits which often took him far from home and their house being two miles from the city was more quiet than her father s place of residence had been she occupied many of her lonely hours in teaching jan various infantile accomplishments and especially in developing his remarkable powers of imitation the birds greatly attracted his attention and in few months he could mock them so perfectly that they mistook his voice their own he soon did the same with the buzz and whirr of every insect and laughed to hear how all the little creatures answered him nature had made him almost sensitive to colours to sounds and whenever his mistress went into the garden he would run after her to beg flower she liked the sound of his little padding feet and often smiled to watch his pliant motions and graceful form clothed only with large bamboo hat and girdle of broad fringe about his loins when the master was at home he was obliged to find his entertainment more among the slaves they generally liked to sing or whistle to him and would laugh merrily at his eager attempts to imitate but some who had children of their own envied the high favour he enjoyed and consequently bore good will toward him they did not dare to strike him but they devised many ways of making him uncomfortable decidedly he liked the parlour better than the slaves quarters 234 235 236 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https preferred it in the first place because he was more attended to there and in the next place because he could hear so many pleasant sounds and see so many pretty things he liked the cool straw carpet and the pale green walls the big china jars were an object of perpetual delight he was never weary of putting his little fingers on the brilliant flowers and butterflies with which they were plentifully adorned but what excited his wonder more than any thing else was folding screen of oriental workmanship which separated the parlour from the there were gilded pagodas chinese mandarins with peacock s feathers in their caps and two large life great deal larger in fact than the mandarins or the pagodas then it was so pleasant to peep out into the garden through the of the verandah to see the blooming roses and the small fountain s silvery veil to inhale the fragrance of the orange blossoms and listen to the cool trickling of the tiny water drops all this was in reality his he knew not that he was little slave and it is the privile ge of unconscious childhood to own whatsoever it delights in in this point of view it all belonged to little jan more truly than it did to van der veen wonder he sighed when the master returned since it condemned him time to degree of exile from his paradise perhaps there was some slight jealousy on the other side also though the gentleman was always kind to his wife s favourite he sometimes hinted at the danger of spoiling him and the intercourse between them was never very familiar at first little jan was afraid to approach the parlour at all when he was at home but on one occasion when his stay was unusually prolonged his patience became exhausted waiting his departure he began by peeping in slyly through the folding screen seeing himself observed he ran away but soon came again and peeped and receiving smile from his mistress he came in timidly and offering his master geranium blossom said may little jan stay maria immediately said oh yes let him stay he is so happy but there was occasion to plead his cause there was resisting his pretty looks and his graceful offering van der veen patted his head and he crept under the table to listen to the piano after that he never avoided his master though he still continued to come in timidly and if not encouraged by smile would run of f to bring flower an when he was about four years old more dangerous rival than husband appeared maria had an infant son which of course greatly engrossed her attention and little jan eyed it petted kitten does new his face assumed an exceedingly grieved expression the first time he saw her caressing the babe he did not cry aloud he was very gentle child but he silently crept away under the table with the flowers he had brought in his mistress and he sat there in very disconsolate attitude tears dropped on the blossoms some of the servants made the matter much worse by saying in his hearing now missis has young one of her own she won t make such fool of that little monkey his heart swelled very much and he ran with all haste to ask madame van der veen if she loved little when he entered the parlour the fond mother happened to be showing her son to visitors and she turned she held him toward the petted slave saying look at him janniken isn t he little beauty replied he louder than any one had ever heard him speak ugly baby and he gave his rival thrust with his little fist he was of course sent away in disgrace and the seeing him in trouble greeted him with the exclamation ha ha little whistler i thought your nose would be put out of clergyman of the reformed dutch church who witnessed this manifesta tion of hostility toward the baby adduced it proof of the inherent depravity of the human heart but time showed that the depravity was not very deep jan felt the bitter pang of being superseded where he loved but he had disposition too kindly to retain his heart soon adopted the infant and they became friends and playmates when little lambert grew old enough to toddle about it was the prettiest of all imaginable sights to see them together among the that crept through the green work of the verandah the baby plump and fair draped in white muslin formed beautiful contrast to his brown companion they looked like two cupids at play one in marble the other in bronze but though they were almost inseparable companions and extremely fond of each other it came to pass through process of painful weaning on the part of little many time he sighed among his playthings when he saw maria caressing her babe without noticing that he was in the room many time tears fell on his neglected of fering of flowers he was however far more fortunate than most slaves who happen to be petted playthings in their childhood he only passed out of an atmosphere of love into an atmosphere of considerate kindness his quick ear all variations of sound continued to be great source of gratification to himself and his indulgent mistress his voice was small like himself but it had sweetness and its very imperfections resulting they did from weakness and inexperience 237 238 239 240 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https an infantine charm to his performances like the lisping of childish prattle or the broken utterance of foreigner when he could sing two or three simple melodies madame van der veen gave him little guitar and taught him to accompany his voice the population of java is an assemblage of various nations and he listened intently to whatever he heard hummed whistled or played in the parlour or in the he knew snatches of great variety of tunes when he was six years old it was his pleasure to twine hindoo arab javanese english and dutch melodies into improvised fantasias which resembled grotesque drawings representing birds and monkeys flowers fruit and human faces bound together in graceful tangle of vines at eight years old he was often trusted to go to gr√©sik on errands following his usual habits of listening and observing during these visits to the city he added greatly to his stock of popular airs and soon learned to imitate all manner of instruments he had formerly imitated the birds hindoo lullabies arab dances the of the javanese they passed up and down the river english marches dutch drinking songs and chinese he could give lively version of them all and he was frequently called into the parlour to repeat them the entertainment of company his master said it was time he was taught to labour maria assented but made an arrangement by which duty and inclination were enabled to go hand in hand she knew that his acutely sensuous nature reveled in perfumes and bright colours therefore she told the dutch gardener to take him an assistant and teach him all the mysteries of his art it is never toilsome employment to rear flowers and train vines and in that sunny fertile region of the earth light labour is repaid by lavish tribute of fragrant blossoms and delicious fruit all the year round jan had an instinctive sense which taught him what colours harmonized and what forms were graceful his mistress often praised his bouquets and garlands and affection her stimulated him to attain much perfection possible in the flowery decorations of her room her table and her dress little lambert had great desire to be helpful also in the garden but the exercise heated him and he so often pulled up flowers instead of weeds that his mother deemed it necessary to retain him in the house this arrangement made him so restless and unhappy that jan undertook the responsibility of supplying him with flowers in the cool arbours and keeping strict watch upon his movements he often decorated him with multitude of small bouquets and twined garlands round his broad hat till he looked like dwarf and then sent him into the house to show himself to his fond mother who was always ready to feign ignorance and inquire what little boy that could be man≈ìuvre invariably rewarded by an infantile laugh in the course of one of these floral exhibitions two followed him in the garden walks his mother who was watching him through the verandah lattice saw the brilliant creatures circling round her darling s head thrusting their long bills into the blossoms with which he was decorated and she clapped her hands in an ecstasy of delight after that it was favourite amusement with jan to attract the and butterflies round little master s hat the next greatest entertain ment was to teach him to imitate the birds and to make him laugh or look solemn while he listened to merry or dolorous music thus bound together by the pleasant links of love and flowers and song they stood together on the threshold of life unable yet to conceive the idea of master and slave but when little lam they called him was six years old he was attacked by one of the violent fevers incident to the climate and all the care unbounded affection could lavish upon him failed to save his life during his illness he was unwilling to lose sight of jan who strewed his pillow with flowers and sang soothing lullabies with unwearied patience if the invalid dozed under the influence of his drowsy monotonous tones he was still unable to leave his post the little hand clasped his if fearful he would go away when the spirit of the dear child departed and the lovely form that once contained it was consigned to the earth one but the father and mother mourned like the first time they visited the grave they found it covered with flowers he had planted there in the house in the garden everywhere he missed the noise of the little feet which seemed like an echo of his own so constantly they followed him while all music was saddened to him because every air he whistled or sung reminded him of some incident connected with the departe d playmate months afterward when he found among the shrubbery wooden toy he had made him he sobbed aloud and all day long the earth seemed darkened to his vision this tender bond between him and the lost one revived all the affectionate interest madame van der veen had ever felt the little but the playfulness of their intercourse was gone being alike unsuited to the sadness of her spirit and the increasing stature of her favourite the young mother drooped under the blow like flowers stricken by black frost never to revive again the healing hand of time rendered her placid and resigned but her former cheerfulness never 241 242 243 244 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https she became very devout and all her music was an utterance of prayer looking on this life with the eye of one weary of its illusions she steadfastly fixed her thoughts on that world whither her darling had gone from the youthful soul of jan the shadow was more easily lifted again he revelled in the bright colours the pungent perfumes and the varied sounds of that luxuriant region of the earth again he began to mock the birds and the boatmen and to mingl in dances with the other young slaves about two years after he lost his best beloved playmate he met with companion who more than supplied his place and who imparted to his existence greater degree of vivacity and joyfulness than he had ever known walking toward gr√©sik one morning to execute some commission his mistress he heard pleasant voice in the distance singing merry tune the sounds approached nearer and nearer and they were so lively that involuntarily his feet moved faster presently young girl emer ged from clump of tamarind trees with basket of fruit on her head and the tune stopped abruptly the expression of her countenance was extremely innocent and modest and though her complexion was of deeper brown than his own blush shone through it like the glow of wine through dark bottle in the sunshine jan noticed this she passed and something he knew not what made him remember her face very distinctly and wish to see it again he never went to gr√©sik without thinking of the merry voice in the distance and never passed the clump of tamarind trees without recalling the bright vision he met there many weeks elapsed before he obtained another glimpse of her but at last he overtook her with her basket on the way to gr√©sik and this time they did not meet to pass each other their path lay in the same direction with mutual bashfulness they spoke and answered and each thought the other handso mer than they had at first supposed the acquaintance thus begun rapidly ripened into intimacy he was not yet thirteen years old and she was not eleven but in that precocious clime cupid shoots at children with bow of sugar and this little maiden carried store of his arrows in her large lustrous eyes after that jan was seized with redoubled zeal to all the errands to gr√©sik and it so happened that he often overtook her on the way or found her resting herself among the tamarind trees then her road homeward was mile the same his own thus they travelled back and forth with their baskets making the air musical they went happy the birds and thoughtless of the coming years during these frequent interviews he learned that she was slave that her mother was from the island of bali and that her arab father had given her the name of zaida before many months elapsed madame van der veen heard from the other servants that jan was in love with pretty girl whose master lived not far from gr√©sik and when she questioned him he bashfully confessed the fact then she spoke very seriously to him and told him how sorry she should be to see him doing many did around him she said if zaida was good girl and wished to marry him she would try to buy her and if they would promise to be faithful and kind to each other they should have handsome wedding at her house and bamboo hut to live in this almost maternal kindness excited his sensitive soul to tears she seized that impressible moment to talk to him concerning his duties to god and to explain how he had made man higher destiny than to mate like the birds season the negotiation the purchase of zaida was somewhat prolonged and she was at last obtained at an unusually high price her master took advantage of madame van der veen s character generosity and indulgence to the inmates of her household meanwhile the gentle lady allowed her slave frequent opportunities of seeing his beloved once week he took his guitar and spent two or three hours with his every errand to gr√©sik was intrusted to him and zaida found many occasions going thither at the same hour very beautiful were the scenes through which they passed in those happy days south of them was range of mountains blue and softened in the distance on the north was the bright sea with the island of madura lying like an emerald gem on its bosom bamboo cottages shaded by mass of luxuriant vegetation dotted the level landscape it were with little islands whose deep verdure formed lovely contrast with the rich yellow of the ripened rice fields here the large scarlet blossoms of pomegranate beautiful above all other trees filled the air with fragrance and there tall reared its great feathery head high above the light elegant foliage of tamarind grove arum lilies held up their large white cups among the luxuriant vines that lay tangled by the wayside wild peacocks and other gorgeous birds flitted across their path glittering in the sunlight like jewels from fairy land the warbling of birds the buzzing of bees the whiz and the whirr of numerous insects all the swarming sounds of tropical life mingled with the monotonous tones of boatmen coming down the river solo with their merchandise singing with measured cadence 245 246 247 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https pull and row brothers pull and row only one discordant note disturbed the chorus which nature sang to love near the house where zaida s master dwelt there lived dutchman and his wife who were notoriously cruel to their slaves zaida recounted some shocking instances of severity and especially expressed pity girl little older than herself who had formerly belonged to very kind master and mistress when they died she was sold at auction and had the misfortune to pass into the hands of their inhuman neighbour whose wife was jealous and lost opportunity of tormenting her when jan was singing some of the plaintive melodies to which his own taste always inclined him or when to amuse the merry zaida he imitated chinese jingle jangles sometimes the sound of the lash accompanied with shrieks would break in upon the music or the merriment and put their spirits out of tune nature had made jan more sensitive than reflective and he had been brought up so like among flowers that he had never thought any thing about his own liabilities slave now the first time it occurred to him what if my master and mistress should die and i should be sold an english family lived very near madame van der veen s and both were musical an intimacy had grown up between them the father and mother of this family were very strongly opposed to slavery and not unfrequently discussed the subject jan he passed in and out of the parlour waiting upon the guests had been accustomed to hear these conversations though he heard them not in fact he often wished the old englishman would stop talking and give his son an opportunity to accompany madame van der veen s piano with his flute but after those lashes and shrieks had waked up his mind to the possibility of auction and transfer he listened more attentively and carried with him into riper years the memory of many things he heard when he was fourteen years old and zaida was twelve they were married madame van der veen furnished cake and lemonade the wedding and gave gay dresses to the juvenile bride and bridegroom who looked extremely well in their new finery jan had lost something of his childish beauty but he was still handsome his yellow complexion was rendered paler by the contrast of his jet black hair and the bright turban that surmounted it his limbs were slender and flexible his features small and well proportioned and his large antelope eyes had floating plaintive expression if there was always tear in his soul zaida was rounder and browner and ruddier her dark hair was combed entirely back and twisted into knot ornamented with scarlet flowers the short downy hairs about the forehead curled themselves into little wavy fringe from her small ears were suspended two large gilded hoops bridal present from the old englishman from her arab father she inherited eyes more beautifully formed than belonged to her mother s race the long dark lashes curled upward and imparted smiling expression even in her most serious moments and when she was amused her eyes laughed outrigh there was harmonized contrast between her and her bridegroom which was extremely agreeable the young englishman compared them to the major and minor mode and madame van der veen said they looked like hope and memory personal comeliness is rare among the natives of those islands little zaida was like ruby among stones bamboo hut raised two feet from the ground and consisting of two apartments without windows was their bridal home it was all they needed in climate where more than half the year all household occupations could be most conveniently performed out of doors there was broad verandah in front sheltered from rain and sun by the projecting roof in front was grove of orange and lemon trees and in the rear was group of plantains whose immensely long broad leaves and yellow spikes of nodding flowers cast refreshing shadows grass mat of jan s own weaving and pillows filled with kind of silky down from wild plant answered bed gourd shells few earthern dishes and wooden waiter from which they ate their meals seated on the floor constituted their simple furniture the rooms which received light from the open door were used only eating and sleeping the verandah was the place where all their sedentary occupations were pursued there zaida might be seen busy at her and loom there jan wove mats and baskets his master s household and there stood his gambang musical instrument with wooden bars of graduated lengths which he struck with mallet to accompany the simple javan ese melodies that he and zaida were accustomed to sing together years passed over their heads without any more serious variations than slight dissensions with the other slaves occasional illness and the frequent birth of children some of them resembled the 248 249 250 251 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https others the mother and some had their eyes obliquely set like the island ancestry from whom they descended some were bright some dull some merry and some pensive but madame van der veen pronounced them all very good children and they certainly were trained to be devotedly attentive to her during their first years it cost nothing to clothe them they ran about naked and it required almost little expense to furnish them with food where rice was so easily cultivated and plantains cocoas and oranges grew wild the warmth of the climate the lavish bounty of the soil the improvident habits which every human being must necessarily form who acquires property by economy and the extreme indulgence with which he had always been treated by his mistress all conspired to render jan forgetful of the precarious tenure by which he held the external blessings of his mere animal existence sometimes when he went to gr√©sik he passed by and the sight always gave him pang it brought up picture of zaida and her children standing there amid the indecent jests and rude handling of crowd of men sometimes he witnessed despotic and cruel treatment of slaves and still more frequently he heard of such instances then came recollections of the lashes and shrieks that used to interrupt his music and merriment in the days of courtship and always they brought with them the question what if zaida and our daughters should ever be sold to such people that cruel dutchman and his jealous wife while any instances were fresh in his mind he listened attentively to whatever was said about slavery by his master and the english family from them he learned how the english during their brief possession of java had interdicted slave traffic with the neighbouring islands had passed laws forbidding slaves to be sold except with their own consent and had allowed them to hold their own any property they were able to acquire van der veen tried to excuse the dutch renewing their by urging that it was necessity imposed upon them because there was other method of procuring servants the englishman denied any such necessity he maintained that the natives of java were intelligent teachable and honest and very willing to render services money he highly commended the native princes never permitting any of their own people to be slaves he told of one of those princes who had inherited fifty slaves but when the british government declared that all should become free unless publicly registered by their masters within specified time he said then i will not register my slaves they shall be free i have kept them hitherto because it was the custom and because the dutch liked to be attended by slaves when they visited the palace but that is not the case with the british they shall cease to be slaves i have long felt shame and my blood has run cold when i have reflected on what i once saw at batavia and semarang where human beings were exposed at public sale placed on table and examined like sheep and the englishman declared that he lost opportunity of talking with all classes of people on the subject and of circulating publications translated into dutch and sent to him from england that purpose and he expressed strong belief that the dutch would soon abolish slavery in these conversations nothing interested jan so much his master s statement that according to existing laws slaves might purchase themselves he resolved to save all the small coins he might receive and visions flitted through his brain of mats and baskets to be made when his daily tasks were completed but when he received this information he already had brood of children he despaired of ever being able to collect money enough to buy them and his anxious thoughts were far more on their account than on his own he always solaced himself with the thought that his mistress would not allow them to be sold while she lived and that she would certainly make provision them before she died sixteen years of his married life had passed away and during all that time such forecasting thoughts had been mere transient clouds fleeting across the sunshine of contentment but the time came when van der veen was summoned to batavia on account of some entanglement in his commercial affairs and three weeks afterwards tidings were brought that he had died suddenly in that unhealthy city again jan saw his mistress bowed to the earth with sorrow and it was beautiful to witness the delicate expressions of sympathy which nature taught him he moved noiselessly and spoke softly he and zaida sang only religious hymns and soothing tunes such she loved to hear after her little lam was taken away his prettiest child then nearly three years old was sent every morning with fresh bouquet of the flowers she loved best he would never lie down the night until he believed she was sleeping and his first waking thoughts were devoted to her it soon became known that van der veen had died in debt and that large portion of his property must be assigned to creditors in this assignme nt were included many slaves in various cities and some belonging to his domestic establishment quite small fortune the widow was saved from the wreck of his wealth and in that she expressly stipulated that jan and all his family should be included together with the estate on which she had always lived since her marriage by this 252 253 254 255 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https turn of affairs the remote contingency which had sometimes created temporary uneasiness in jan s mind was brought frightfully near he never again forgot single day scarcely single hour that he was merely favoured slave and that all the lives intertwined with his held their privileges by the same precarious tenure he never hinted his anxiety to any one but zaida but madame van der veen had the thoughtful kindness to assure him that she would dispossess herself of every thing rather than part with him and his family saying at the same time that there was danger of her being called upon to make any such sacrifice there was enough property left to enable them all to live comfortably he deeply and gratefully felt her kindness but the shadow of her death fell darkly across the consolation it imparted not the world would he have told her so lest the suggestion should increase her melancholy by making her suppose that even the most attached of her servants and the only ones she had left wanted to be free to quit her service their english neighbour being involved in the same commercial difficulties that had deranged van der veen s affairs concluded to sell all his property in java and remove to calcutta he and his family spent their last evening with the widow of their deceased friend while jan was arranging fruit their refreshment in the adjoining room he heard his own name and that of zaida uttered in low tones accompanied with the disjointed words so much petted the more hard make in her usual soft tones but so clearly that he heard every word madame van der veen replied i have thought of all that my good friend i will never part with any of them while i live and when i die i will leave them all why not now urged the importunate englishman she answered my heart is heavy and business oppresses but i assure you most solemnly that i will attend to it very she never knew what heavy load those words removed from the soul of her favourite slave after he heard them he seemed to step on air zaida to whom the important discovery was forthwith imparted was even more elated they hugged and kissed their little ones that night with feeling they had never known before and zeal in the service of their good mistress was thenceforth redoubled at the departure of the english family they gave some gay calico dresses to zaida and the children and violin to the old gentleman put golden ducat in his hand saying i thank you my good fellow all your attentions to and mine there is trifling keepsake may the blessing of heaven go with it mine does i shall remember you all in my prayers farewell jan always continue to be faithful and the poor slave had never possessed piece of gold before and small it was it seemed to him golconda mine first he buried it in the ground and put stone over it then he was afraid some creature might dig it up in the night so he sewed it into pouch which he fastened securely within the girdle he constantly wore the cares and anxieties of wealth had come upon him while the carriage was waiting to convey the englishman away he walked over to madame van der veen s to bid final farewell his last words were my dear madame don t forget the talks we have had together especially what we said last night since i have lived in java i have done my utmost to sow good seed on this subject and i trust it will spring up and bring forth harvest sooner or later from time to time i shall send the magistrates publications that will prevent their forgetting what i have so often urged upon them blessing will rest upon this beautiful island in proportion they attend to this remember it in your prayers my dear friend and use your influence aright don t say it is small you have seen in your garden how great growth comes from one little seed my friend there are responsibilities in human society which we shall have to answer unto our god and now farewell the voice of the old man will never urge you more may the blessing of heaven be with you the widow wept freely he had been her husband s friend and the words he spoke were solemn she resolved to make her will and have it duly witnessed that very day but visitor came and after her departure she felt degree of lassitude which unfitted her exertion the next day she looked over letters from her husband and brought on headache by inordinate weeping she was indolent by temperam ent and by habit and she was oppressed with melancholy weeks passed on without any more definite result than frequent resolution to make her will she had gone to bed with mind much impressed with what her english friend said at parting and troubled with that she had neglected it so long when zaida was summoned to her bedside at midnight and found her head hot and her pulse throbbing in the morning she was delirious and looked wildly upon her faithful attendants without recogniz ing them with her incoherent ravings during the day were frequently mixed the words the slaves listened tearfully to these broken sentences and felt fresh assurance that she had provided 256 257 258 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https them the physician thought otherwise but he merely said that something disturbed her mind and if her life was not spared he hoped she would have an interval of reason before she died at the sound of that dreadful if jan rushed out of the room rolled himself on the floor and sobbed convulsively there was selfishness in his sorrow he had not the slightest doubt that she who never broke promise had cared thoughtfully the future welfare of himself and his family it was simply the agony of parting from his earliest and best friend she lingered four days but reason never returned into that brief period was compressed more misery than jan had experienced during his whole life gloomy forebodings brought all the superstitions of the island in their train the first night his mistress was taken ill he shook his head and said ah zaida don t you remember she went to surabaya to dine the very day we heard of master s death i told you then it was very bad sign to go abroad the same day that you hear of the death of the next night he was startled by an unusual noise attributed to explosions among the distant volcanic mountains and that was regarded certain prognostic of impending disaster the following day was unusually sultry and in the evening he saw phosphoric light quivering over the nasturtiums in the garden he had never witnessed the phenomenon before and he was not aware that such peculiarity had been previously observed in that glowing plant he had doubt that the light came from spirits who were waiting madame van der veen s soul on the fourth morning he saw two crows fighting in the air and thenceforth he had hope the spirit of his beloved mistress departed from her body at midnight the rainy season was then approaching attended by the usual characteristic of violent storms the house trembled with the rolling thunder and flashes of intensel y vivid lightning illumined the bed where the corpse lay imparting moment an appalling glare to its ghastly paleness jan and zaida were familiar with such storms but never before had they seemed so awful amid the of that deserted house friendly neighbour pitied their grief and terror and offered to remain with them until after the funeral it was like tearing jan s heart out to see that dear face carried away where he could behold it more exquisitely sensitive by nature his whole being was now all nerve and feeling lacerated to the extremest degre of suffering she was placed by the side of her little lam and there he planted the flowers she had best loved he laid himself down on the ground and moaned like faithful dog on his master s grave he thought of the stories others had told him concerning his petted childhood he remembered her sympathy and good advice when he was first in love with zaida he recalled thousand instances of her indulgent kindness the whole crowned by the precious gift of freedom he could not reconcile himself to the thought that he should never again have her to rely upon he had heart any thing but to tend the flowers on those graves when this storm of grief began to subside he consoled himself with the thought whatever happens now i can never again suffer i have more than week passed before he heard that madame van der veen had left will that she had survived all her immediate relatives and that the nearest heir to the property resided at manilla this was stunning blow zaida reminded him how their good mistress had instructed them to pray to god when they were in trouble and many fervent imploring supplication ascended from their humble hut jan resolved to plead earnestly with the heir and he comforted himself with the idea that the physician would tell him how their kind mistress had spoken of their freedom during her illness but even if his entreaties should prevail with the stranger where could they live could they be sure of finding employment he spent every leisure moment in weaving mats and baskets sale and the children were kept busy gathering wild fruits the market those things sold very low price and it would be long time indeed before he could acquire piece of land and hut by that process but the gold piece he felt of his girdle to ascertain if it was safe yes it was there from which his imagination hatch ed large brood of chickens hope struggled with anxiety few weeks and zaida who always looked on the bright side continually repeated her belief that every thing would turn out well but at last news arrived that the heir did not intend to visit java that he had intrusted the business to an agent with instructions to sell all the property of every description and remit the proceeds to him poor jan thought he could never again suffer he had suffered but he was mistaken this last blow broke him down entirely vision of the with his children bid off to different purchasers was always before him the lashes and shrieks which had so much impressed his youthful mind forever resounded in his imagination but now the shrieks came from zaida and their little ones during the three weeks that preceded the sale he could scarcely eat or sleep he became emaciated and haggard to such degree that all who knew him felt pity him the sympathizing 259 260 261 262 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https was however soon quieted by saying to themselves it is hard case but it can not be helped poor fellow i hope they will find kind the physician spoke to many people in gr√©sik and its neighbourhood declaring there could be manner of doubt that madame van der veen had fully intended they

instructions he had received the case excited good deal of interest many of the dutch residents shook their heads when they heard of it and said the english are in the right this system is disgrace and blight upon our all the day preceding the auction jan lay moaning at the grave of his mistress all night he wandered round looking at the flowers in the moonlight he had tended them so long they seemed to know him and to nod sorrowful farewell sadder still it was to look upon the bamboo hut and its enclosure connected with the garden by little gate that bridal home which his kind mistress had provided them and which was consecrated to his memory by so many years of humble happiness never had it seemed so dear to him now there stood the loom where he had so often seen zaida at work there was the gambang he had made himself the sounds of which his departed master and mistress used to love to hear mingled with their voices softened by the evening air on which they floated across the garden there hung the old guitar she had given him in boyhood and by its side was the violin parting present from the young englishman even if he was allowed to retain these would they ever sound again they had sounded there the dawning light revealed each familiar object stifling pain swelled more and more within his heart when he saw his children eating what would perhaps be their last breakfast together every gourd shell that contained their little mess of rice seemed more valuable in his eyes than crown jewels to dethroned monarch overcome with the struggle he laid himself down on the mat and sobbed zaida always hopeful had borne up tolerably well till now but now she yielded to despair and rocked backward and forward violently groaning aloud eight children the oldest lad of fourteen the youngest girl of three years old sat on the floor weeping or hiding their heads in their mother s lap thus they were found by the man who came to take them to the auction at gr√©sik poor jan how often in the latter years had vague presentiments of this flitted across his mind when he passed that dreadful place he too well remembered the heartless jokes and the familiar handling which had made him shrink from the possibility of such fate his wife and children zaida indeed was longer an object of jealo usy any cruel master s wife she was not hideously ugly like most slaves of her age in that withering climate but her girlish beauty had all departed except ghost of it still lingering in her large dark eyes their light was longer mirthfu l but they were still beautiful in colour and expressed it were the faint echo of laugh in their peculiar outline and long curling lashes by her side stood daughter twelve years old quite handsome she was at that age and another of ten with her father s gazelle eyes and the golden yellow complexion which javanese poets are accustomed to praise the perfection of loveliness the wretched aspect of the father and mother struck all beholders when jan mounted the stand he cast one despairing glance around him and lingered longest on the smallest lamb of his flock who was crying with terror and clinging fast to her mother s skirts he tossed his arms wildly upward gave one loud groan then bowed his head and wept in silence poor zaida hid her face on his shoulder and the whole group trembled like leaves in storm the auctioneer called out here s valuable lot gentlemen eight healthy children the father and mother still young enough to good deal of work and both of excellent character whoever will bid six thousand florins them may have them and it will be great it was comfort to the poor victims to be offered in lot they might be bought by speculators who would separate them jan listened with all his soul in his ears not voice was heard the auctioneer waited moment before he called out will you say four thousand florins gentlemen one spoke shall i have two thousand florins that is really too still all remained silent jan had never forgotten that his master had said the law allowed slaves to buy themselves his poverty had hitherto prevented his deriving any consolation from that thought but now ray of hope darted through his soul he raised his drooping head suddenly and gleam like the rising sun passed over his pale haggard countenance he said eagerly i will give golden then dropping on his knees he exclaimed in imploring tones which intense emotion rendered thrilling oh gentlemen don t bid over it is all i have in the world oh good gentlemen don t bid over tears dropped from the eyes of many young people the agent swallowed hard and even the auctioneer was conscious of choking feeling in his throat there was deep silence while the 263 264 265 266 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria

going ducat 2 20 cents going going gone to jan van der veen it was one of humanity s inspired moments when men are raised above the base influences of this earth and see things spirits see them in the light of heaven hats turbans and handkerchiefs waved and cheerful hurra met the ears of the redeemed captives jan belonged to himself and owned all his family verily the blessing of heaven did go with the englishman s golden ducat to degree far beyond what he dreamed of when he gave it jan could hardly credit his own senses the reaction from despair to such overwhelming joy was too much him his brain was dizzy and his limbs trembled when he tried to rise he tottered and would have fallen if zaida had not caught him in her arms poor fellow poor fellow murmured some of the spectators man took off his hat dropped florin into it and passing it round said give him trifle gentlemen to set himself up with he has always been good industrious fellow and his mistress mean t to provide him give him trifle gentlemen there was noise of falling coin zaida pulled her husband by the sleeve and whispered in his ear thank the he seemed like one half awake but he made an effort and said thank you good gentlemen may god bless you and he would have added children but his eye happened to rest on his own smallest darling and the thought that nobody could take her from him now choaked his utterance he covered his face with his thin hands and wept was the golden ducat all that poor despairing slave owed to the good englishman that was the smallest part of the debt to the moral influence of his conversation and the books and papers he scattered in the neighbourhood migh t mainly be attributed the changing public sentiment which rendered the crowd silent at that mournful scene and thus enabled the auctioneer to exclaim the whole lot going ducat going gone to jan van der veen hurra to the nasturtium which linn√¶us describes emitting phosphoresence in the dark 267 268 the project

was born in the genial climate of ionia from infancy his hold on material life seemed exceedingly slight he was delicate frail blossom by living rays refined trembler of the wind spiritual flower sentient of breeze and shower but the slender thread that bound him to this mortal existence did not break the babe crawled from his cradle and toddled into the fields where he would sit motionless hours by the side of some flower he loved grave smile would illumine his countenance if butterfly rested on it or passing bird brushed it with her wing he always expected to see the flower fly too and therefore he watched it so patiently it swayed under their light pressure in very early childhood he was remarkable the keenness of his senses and the vividness of his dreams he heard distant sounds 269 270 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https even to the quick ear of his playmate the hound and the perfume of rose made him faint before he was old enough to explain why he turned so pale at vintage time when processions in honor of bacchus passed through the village his mother dared not take him to the show where all other children were dancing and capering once when she carried him with her to the rustic festival he fell into violent fits at the sound of the shrill pipes and the clashing cymbals his dreams furnished theme all the gossips of the neighborhood the scenes he witnessed in sleep impressed themselves on his mind with such singular distinctness that nothing could persuade the child he had not actually seen them sometimes when they gave him his little bowl of goat s milk supper he would cry the lamb with beautiful wool that had eaten portion of his milk the night before and it was quite useless to try to persuade him that there was such creature lamb to all their assertions he would answer with lively pertinacity i did see him i did see him and he did drink from my he grew older he sometimes hummed snatches of tunes which he said were sung to him by maidens in white robes with garlands about their heads and the melodies were unlike any known in the neighbourhood several times he walked along the road he started suddenly at the approach of stranger and ran away shuddering when his companions asked why he did so he would answer ah that was very bad man he made feel all over it was wonder that the simple village rs became superstitious concerning such singular child some remembered that before he was born his mother had carried offerings into consecrated grotto where stood statue of apollo and that being overcome by the warmth of the day she had fallen asleep there this gave rise to the story that in her dreams she had heard the god playing upon his golden lyre that the divine sounds had pervaded her whole being and endowed her child with apollo s gift of prophecy others declared that the altar in the sacred grotto had several years been loaded with her devout offerings and that she had been heard to say the statue sometimes smiled upon her such tokens of approbation from celestial beings were by means deemed incredible but they implied that the worshipper was favourite with the deity she served from this belief it was easy to infer that the extraordinary child who saw and heard things invisible and inaudible to other mortals might be veritable son of apollo some old crones shook their heads mournfully and said children who received peculiar endowments from the gods generally died young but the little hermotimus wandered about with his father s shepherds and was gradually invigorated by air and exercise he longer fainted at perfumes or shared his supper with coloured lambs his mother still notice d peculiar dreaminess in the expression of his eyes and when he was alone she sometimes heard him singing melodies which came to him from some mysterious source she kept her thoughts in the privacy of her own heart but she retained her belief that his remarkable boyhood was the forerunner of something extraordinary in manhood with his improving health the gossip of the neighbourhood gradually subsided and was only occasionally revived by some eccentricities in his manners the change pleased his father well he wanted son to aid him in the acquisition of wealth and had desire to see him become either poet or prophet he charged his wife never to talk to him about his childish dreams and he was annoyed by any allusions to her sleep in apollo s grotto of course the lad was aware that things had been said of him which his mother believed and his father disliked to have mentioned this mystery made him think more about himself than he would otherwise have done and increased his tendency to lonely wanderings and profound reveries his father did his utmost to allure him to convivial meetings with young people saying to himself that sharp shot from cupid s bow was the best thing to wake him up thoroughly but the timid youth scarcely ventured to raise his eyes in the presence of maidens and appeared to take even less notice of their charms than he did of flowers and birds and other beautiful things his father thought that mate unlike himself possible would be most likely to counteract his peculiar tendencies he therefore selected praxino√´ buxom lass who was so healthy she never had but one dream she remembered in the whole course of her life and that was of being at vintage festival where she pelted the young men with clusters of grapes till the wine ran down their chins and made her wake with laughing certainly she would have chosen quite another sort of mate than hermotimus with his soft voice and dreamy eyes but it was the belief in those days and it has kept its ground pretty well ever since that women have right to an opinion of their own so the parents arranged the affair between them and the passive young couple were married 271 272 273 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https was energetic and ambitious she prided herself on the excellent chees es she made and the quantity of grapes she dried the market she was always talking of these and hermotimus tried to listen patiently though she unconsciously tormented him to greater degree than ever his thrifty father had done sometimes he even praised her industry and smiled in his absent sort of way he had kind of pleasure in the company of his pretty young bride he had in the presence of lively twittering bird had modern caricaturist made picture of their wedded life he would have painted it the marriage of solemn young owl with chattering wren hermotimus was often bewildered by her volubility and her incessant activity sometimes made him feel weary if he had himself been hard at work he loved to sit hours in silent thoug ht meditating on the nature of the soul revolving in his mind whether the gods ever did unite themselves with mortals and whether those philosophers had spoken truly who had affirmed that there was something divine within the body which would lay aside its temporary garment of flesh resume its native wings and return to celestial home to dwell among immortals while his thoughts were plunged in such profound meditations it not unfrequently happened that praxino√´ came to inquire whether he remembered how many cheeses she had sent to market or how many bushels of grapes were in readiness and if he forgot the number she had told him he generally did her cheerful temper became with consciousness that the energy and industry on which she prided herself were altogether unappreciated it was hard disappointment her to bear she loved luxury and was born to sun herself in the pleasures of this world hermotimus would have pitied her if he could but he never was in that region where she lived and he did not know what people enjoyed or suffered there praxino√´ had little idea of the worlds through which he wandered and the glimpses she obtained from his occasio nal remarks were by means attractive to her she had much less desire celestial wings than she had fine woolens and glossy silks and the land of disembodied souls presented to her mind pleasant pictures of comfortable housekeeping her favourite topics of conversation were embroidered mantles and robes of tyrian dye and if her husband sought to check her by remarking that such expensive articles could never be obtained by them she answered impatiently why not people can have what they will the greeks got into troy didn t they sometimes she would add in an undertone of vexation but they were not such greeks thou undoubtedly he was vexation to an mild dreamy saintly man the distance between them inevitably grew wider and wider and the process was hastened by changes in the condition of hermotimus though he had become more healthy in youth than he was in infancy there had never been complete union between his soul and body the inner and outer circles of his being instead of clasping into each other touched only at one point and so remained nearly strangers at the time of his marriage he was believed to have outgrown the feebleness of his childhood and to have lost the power of prophecy but two years afterward he fell asleep one day in the same grotto of apollo to which his mother had been accustomed to carry offerings he came out pale and chill and was that night seized with singular kind of fits which continued to attack him more and more frequently the old gossip was renewed the neighbours said his father the divine apollo had kissed him in his sleep and he would never be like other men praxino√´ nursed him carefully she had kindly heart but when the fits were on him he inspired degree of awe amounting almost to terror his looks and words impressed her with strong conviction that he was some sort of spirit and not mortal man at times he told her the most secret thoughts of her heart and repeated word word what had been said to her when he was out of hearing he frequently described magnificent cities gorgeous birds and beautiful flowers she had never seen or heard of but what made her shudder more than all else was the familiar intercourse he described with relatives and friends long since dead if she were alone with him during these strange visitations he never answered when she spoke or gave any indication that he was aware of her presence but there was one person to whose questions he always replied in the neighbouring city of clazomen√¶ lived pythagorean philosopher named prytanes he heard rumours of the singular childhood of hermotimus and of the extraordinary fits that had come upon him in manhood and he was desirous to ascertain how far these accounts had been exaggerated when he made his first visit to him who was called the sleeping prophet he found him lying upon couch motionless and senseless he took hold of his hand and found it cold and rigid but change went over the countenance like the light which drives shadows across the fields and hermoti mus said i am glad you have come again above all things i have enjoyed our pleasant walks together in the groves talking of the wings of the this seemed marvellous to prytanes never to his knowledge had he spoken with hermotimus but when he asked questions concerning their conversations the 274 275 276 277 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https revealed to him many thoughts which he remembered to have passed through his own mind at various times and which had seemed to him at the moment if they did not originate in himself but had come to him from some unknown source thoughts which he in fact believed to have been imparted by supernal beings when prytanes returned to clazomen√¶ he gave an account of this wonderful experience in public discourses to his disciples and the fame of hermotimus spread more and more widely priests and philosophers came to listen to his conversations with prytanes and while some went away incredulous others were deeply impressed with awe from far and near people brought the diseased to him begging him to prescribe cure and the rumour went round that sometimes when he merely passed his hands over them their pains departed in these days he would have been called clairv oyant but what we style had then never been mentioned though its phenomena were occasionally manifested they always have been wherever the spiritual and physical circle of man s compound existence is partially disjoined scientific causes were then little investig ated health beauty eloquence poetry and all other things were supposed to be direct and special gifts from some god wonder then that many believed hermotimus to be really the son of apollo receiving the gift of healing and of prophecy from immediate and continual intercourse with his divine father if the wise and thoughtful were puzzled it may well be supposed that the busy little praxino√´ often felt if she were walking among shadows in fog her ambition was in some degree gratified by her husband s fame and by the distinguished persons who came to visit him but in confidential conversation with her gossips she complained that these numerous visitors interrupted her avocations beside bringing great deal of dust into the house and asking draught of her fresh wine rather oftener than was convenient i admire hospitality she would say and i wish i were rich enough to feast all ionia every week and send each guest away with golden bracelet but the fact is these dreams of hermotimus though they are full of palaces and fountains not help in the least to build such things and he brings home wine from the beautiful vineyards he describes then i can t help thinking sometimes that it would be pleasant to know certainty whether one s husband were really dead or one thing became daily more obvious to her and to all who saw him the contin ual questions he was called upon to answer and the dista nt places of the earth he was required to visit exhausted the little bodily strength he possessed the priests at the neighbouring temple of √¶sculapius said he needed more quiet and ought to drink strong decoction of vervain gathered when the moonlight rested on it he himself when questioned during his miraculous slumbers declared that the air of the valleys was not good him therefore his friends removed him to residence among the hills praxino√´ made objection though her spiritualized mate failed to call forth all the warmth of her loving nature she had friendly feeling him and would gladly have done any thing the recovery of his health but the change was by means agreeable to her lively disposition she liked to live where she could see festive processions passing with garlands and gaily dressed youths and maidens dancing to the sound of cymbals and flutes news from the city became more rare hermotimus recovered his health and with it lost what was called his gift of prophecy consequently visitors came less and less frequently urged by praxino√´ the diseased one sometimes tried to render himself practically useful but his heart was in such occupations even less than it had formerly been companionship with philosophers had excited his intellect and induced the habit of watching his own soul with intense interest he was absorbed in reverie most of the time and prytan who came occasionally to see him was the only person with whom he conversed freely their conversation was more wearisome to praxino√´ than his dreamy silence she said they might be wise owls all she knew to the contrary but that she could see more sense in their talk than she did in the hooting of those solemn birds of darkness in another respect hermotimus seemed to her like an owl his eyes became so nervously sensitive to light that he winked continually in the sunshine and was prone to seek the shelter of grottoes and shady groves his childish habit of vivid dreams returned and the explanation of these dreams occupied his thoughts continually one morning he told praxino√´ he had dreamed that she held in her hand crystal globe that reflected all things in the universe that she threw it into the flames where it cracked asunder and there rose from it radiant spirit with large white wings she laughed and said if she had such globe she would not break it till she had taken peep at corinth to see the embroidered silks and golden girdles that the women wore there he was thinking of the winged spirit and her remark passed through his ears without reaching his mind had he listened to the observation it would have seemed to him very much like looking through the universe to watch 278 279 280 281 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https butterfly nothing was interesting to him but the process of attaining wings to his soul he thought of this till the body seemed an encumbrance and its necessities sin he ate sparingly at all times and fasted often when he spoke at all his talk was ever of mortifying the sense s that the soul might be enabled to rise to the ethereal spheres from which it had fallen into this world praxino√´ was impatient with such discourse to think of his talking of mortifying the senses exclaimed she when he never had any senses to mortify why never since i knew him has he eaten enough to keep nightingale alive my part i think it is blessing to have plenty of good food and an excellent appetite in her present situation she was not sustained through her trials she had been near clazomen√¶ by the reverence which her husband inspired their dwelling was isolated and in the nearest village were many scoffers and skeptics she had formed an intimacy with wealthy dame named eucoline and from her she learned that people said hermotimus neglected to provide his family because he was too indolent to work that he injured his health by frequent fasts and made himself crazy with thinking merely the sake of being stared at by the common people and his pretended visions and prophecies they were undoubtedly impositions praxino√´ who habitually looked outward her standard of thought and action was much influenced by these remarks she had sometimes wept in secret over her cheerless destiny but discontent had been restrained by reverent sense of being connected with some solemn mystery which others respected now she began to doubt whether the eccentricities she daily witnessed might not be assumed from the motives imputed by their neighbours this tendency was increased by the influence of eratus the gay luxurious husband of eucoline he professed to be disciple of epicurus but he was one of those who had perverted the original doctrines of that teacher while he thought happiness was the only good he believed there was enjoyment higher than that of the senses to his volatile mind all things in life afforded subjects jest and laughter if he met praxino√´ on her way to his wife s apartments he would say how is the good hermotimus has he gone to talk with the gods and thrown his body on the couch till he returns these sneers were not pleasant and the habit of comparing her situation with that of eucoline increased her discontent the handsome and healthy eratus was growing richer every day by his own energy and enterprise such robes he buys his wife said she to herself i can make better wine than she can i can weave handsomer cloth and i think the gods have endowe d with more beauty but i can never hope to wear such robes ah if my good hermotimus were only more alive this involuntary comparison did great harm until her friend eucoline chanced to die suddenly then the idea came into her head if i could marry eratus what noble span we should make we might ride in our own chario t inlaid with ivory and gold perhaps it may happen some day who knows didn t the greeks get into troy she tried to drive away the pleasing vision but it would intrude itself and worse still the handsome eratus often came in person to bring choice grapes and figs in the prettiest of all imaginable vases and baskets he was always friendly with hermo timus and if his body had wandered away carried by the soul which was so generally absent from this material world the epicurea n would inquire in this jocular way where is the good hermotimus pretty one has he gone off to converse with the gods if venus had given such beautiful companion at home all olym pus wouldn t tempt away from the gay graceful flattering man he was dangerous contrast to her pale silent husband hiding himself in groves and grottoes thinking only of obtaining wings his soul eratus was conscious of his power and betrayed it by expressive glances from his large dark eyes sparks fell from them into the heart of the neglected wife and kindled fire there which glowed through her cheeks her eyelids drooped under his ardent gaze and she avoided looking at him when he spoke but she could not shut out the melting tenderness of his tones it was hard trial to poor praxino√´ her nature had such tropical exuberance she was born with such love of splendour such capacity joy and the cruel fates had cast her destiny in such cold and shady places her pride had sometimes been an evil companion but it now proved friend in need if she could not be the wife of eratus she resolved not to give cupid any more opportunities to shoot arrows from his eyes or play amorous tunes with his musical voice when she saw the flatterer approaching she retreated hastily and left an old vant to receive him and thank him the grapes he had brought hermotim us eratus smiled at the veil she thus endeavoured to throw over his attentions and to deprive her of the subterfuge he sent her golden bracelet and which she could not thank him in the name of her husband she returned the costly gift though affection vanity and love of elegance strongly tempted her to retain it she was brave woman the prudes in the neighbourhood who were accustomed to 282 283 284 285 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https their heads and say she laughed and talked more than was consistent with decorum never knew half how brave she was this prudent reserve of course rendere d her more interesting to the enamored widower the more he thought of her the more he was vexed that such vivacious creature with mantling complexion laughing eyes and springing step should be appropriated by pale devotee who took notice of her charms and who in fact despised even the most beautiful body regarding it merely prison the soul at last he plainly expressed wish to marry her and he proposed to ask hermotimus to divorce her that purpose which the laws of the country enabled him to praxino√´ with bashful frankness confessed her willingness and said she did not think hermotimus would observe whether she were prese nt or absent if he understands my proposition replied eratus laughing he will give grave lecture and tell how the wings of his soul are growing by with drawing from all the pleasures of this world let them grow the sudden and alarming illness of hermotimus arrested the progress of affairs the kindness of praxino√´ overcame all other feeling s and she said she would not leave him to the care of hirelings he recovered slowly and again wandered forth into the groves with feeble steps eratus watched him impatiently and when at last he seemed sufficiently recovered to enter into conversation he sought an interview he found him lying on the ground in one of his favourite groves cold and rigid corpse he called servants to convey him to the house praxino√´ manifested surprise she said she had not seen him in such state two years but that in former times he would often lie senseless long time and then wake up to tell of wonderful countries he had visited day passed after day and he did not wake the disciples of skeptical philosophers came and looked at him and went away laughing with each other about the stories they had heard of his former visions prophecies and miraculous cures they concluded their remarks by saying it can harm to burn his body whether he is dead or not the soul he had so much faith in was always longing to get out of prison it would be conferring favour upon him to give him chance to try his wings the parents of hermotimus were dead eratus summoned priests of √¶sculapius who decidedly pronounced his slumber the sleep of death and the relatives of praxino√´ sympathized with his impatience the funeral but she continued to doubt and insisted upon first sending the pythagorean philosopher whom hermotimus had always answered when he was in those strange trances the messenger returned with tidings that he had gone to athens the was erected and the widow wept to find that the certainty of his death was such relief to her mind this consciousness was the more unpleasant to her because she said to herself if he is in one of those trances he knows all i am when they lifted him from the couch where he had lain so still she shuddered violently and exclaimed surely he is not quite so pale he was but they reasoned with her and said he looks just he has the last three she saw his body placed on the and when the flames began to curl round it she listened to hear if there were any audible signs of life but all was still save the crackling of the wood and in short time heap of ashes was all that remained that night she dreamed that she held crystal globe in her hands and threw it from her into the flames the globe cracked and radiant spirit with white wings rose from it and soared high into the air he smiled he passed her and said i foretold the countenance looked that of hermotimus had sometimes looked in his trances when he told his friend prytanes that he was listening to maidens who played on golden harps but though similar in expression it was far more glorious did memory cause that dream or was it imparted from some other source beyond herself she woke trembling and afraid and with strong impression that she had seen hermotimus this belief excited uneasy thoughts which she dared not mention fear of slanderous tongues but she secretly confessed to eratus that she feared her husband was not dead when they burned his body he replied it is foolish to trouble yourself about dream my lovely one it is enough that all who saw him thought he was dead you know it often puzzled wiser folks than you or i to tell whether he was alive or not whatever phantom it was that sailed through the ivory gate of dreams he smiled and seemed happy then why be disturbed about it life was given enjoyment he laughed and began to sing i ll crown my love with myrtle and his looks and tones drove all phantoms from her thoughts she soon became his wife and her ambitious hopes were more than realized eratus placed high value on worldly possessions and knew very well how to obtain them she never had occasion to remind him that the greeks entered troy 286 287 288 289 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https where there is sunshine there is always shadow her prosperity excited envy which some manifested by saying if every body could burn poor husband the sake of marrying rich one other folks could wear silk mantles remarks of that kind reached the ears of many who were firm believers in the inspiration of the sleeping prophet they made anxious inquiries concerning the manner of his death to which certain envious women answered praxino √´ was always very good neighbour we have nothing to say against her thoug h some people thought she was rather free and not little vain the old nurse says eratus was always sending her presents long before her husband died and some people think it was very obliging in poor hermotimus to die just when he was so much wanted out of the these whisperings soon grew into report that the rich epicurean had bribed the priests of √¶sculapius to pronounce the slumberer dead man of course some persons were enough to repeat these rumours to the parties implicated finding their solemn assertions of innocence received with significant silence or annoying innuendoes they resolved to remove from the neighbourh ood praxino√´ had always greatly desire d to see corinth and to please her eratus chose it their future residence in that gay luxurio us city her love of splendour was abundantly gratified with pompous processions and showy equipage her beauty attracted attention whenever she was seen in public and her husband took pride in adorning her with rich embroidery and costly jewels in such an atmosphere the wings of her soul had small chance to grow but that subject never occupied her thoughts it was generally believed in clazomen√¶ and its vicinity that hermotimus was not dead when his emaciated body was consumed on the this idea occasioned good deal of excitement among those who had been cured of diseases by his directions or startled to hear their inmost thoughts revealed his frequent conversations with spirits of the departed had strongly impressed them with the belief that some god spoke through him while his senses were wrapped in profound slumber and skeptical witticisms or arguments could diminish their faith in the prophet they erected temple to his memory where they placed his ashes in golden urn and because his wife had consented that his body should be burned while his soul was absent on one of its customary visits to the gods they never allowed any woman to enter within the consecrated precincts spirit and matter reverie not in

repast her voracious jaws so i climbed ladder and took down the box which contained nest with two pretty little white eggs i was distressed with the idea that the hateful cat migh t have destroyed my favourites before i perceived their dange r but my anxiety was soon relieved by their approach they circled round and round the spot peered about in every direction perched on the platform where their home had stood and chattered together with unusual volubility again and again they returned bringing other birds with them and repeating the same motions they were evidently much astonished we should be to wake up in the morning and find that an earthquake had swallowed neighbour s house during the night whether there were scientific swallows among them that tried to frame satisfactory theories in explanation of the phenomenon or whether any feathered clericals taught them to submit to the event special providence we can never know the natural presumption is that they will always wonder to the end of their days what mysterious agency it could have been that so suddenly removed their nest house and all conjecturing why it was done the mere query was probably beyond the range of their mental powers i was watching them all the time but their bird eyes could not see and their conveyed magnetic intimation of my close vicinity their surprise and their trouble were partially revealed to by their motions and their utterance but though they were intell igent swallows they could form idea of such fact i had removed their dwelling to save their lives but between their plane of existence and my own there was such an impassable chasm that explanation of my kindness and foresight could possibly be conveyed to them i thought of all this and longed in vain to enlighten their ignorance and relieve their perplexity the earnestness of my wish and the impossibility of accomplishing it suggested train of thought i said to myself perhaps some invisible beings are now observing i am observing these swallows but i can not perceive them because the laws of their existence are too far removed from my own perhaps they take friendly interest in my affairs and would gladly communicate with if i were so constituted that i could understand their ideas or their mode of utterance these cogitations recalled to my mind some remarks by the old english writer soame jenyns in his disquisition on the chain of universal being he says the superiority of man to that of other terrestrial animals is inconsiderable in proportion to the immense plan of universal existence the difference of climate between the north and south end of the paper i now write upon with regard to the heat and distance of the sun there is nothing leads us into so many errors concerning the works and designs of providence the foolish vanity that can persuade such insignificant creatures that all things were made their service from whence they ridiculously set up utility to themselves the standard of good and conclude every thing to be evil which appears injurious to them or their purposes well might nest of ants imagine this globe of earth created only them to cast up into hillocks and clothed with grain and herbage their sustenance then accuse their creator permitting spades to destroy them and ploughs to lay waste their habitations they feel the inconveniences but are utterly unable to comprehend their uses well the relations they themselves bear to superior beings when philosophers have seen that the happiness of inferior creatures is dependent on our wills it is surprising none of them should have concluded that the good order and of the universe might require that our happine ss should be dependent on the wills of superior beings who are accountable like ourselves to one common lord and father of all things this is the more wonderful because the existence and influence of such beings has been an article in the creed of all religions that have ever appeared in the world in the beautiful system of the pagan theology their sylvan and household deities their nymphs satyrs and fawns were of this kind all the barbarous nations that have ever been discovered have been found to believe in and adore intermediate spiritual beings both good and evil the jewish religion not only confirms the belief of their 293 294 295 296 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https but of their tempting deceiving and tormenting mankind and the whole system of christianity is erected entirely on this johnson wrote satirical review of soame jenyns which had great popularity at the time he passes without notice the fact that men of all ages and of all religions have believed that malicious spirits cause diseases and tempt men in many ways to their destruction while benevolent spirits cure physical and mental evils forewarn men in dreams and assist them in various emer gencies there was therefore nothing very new or peculiar in the suggestion of jenyns but johnson in his rough way caricatures it thus he imagines that we have animals not only food but some our diversion the same privilege may be allowed to beings above us who may deceive torment or destroy us the ends only of their own pleasure or utility he might have carried the analogy further much to the advantage of his argument he might have shown that these hunters whose game is man have many sports analogous to our own we drown whelps and kittens they amuse themselves now and then with sinking ship and they stand round the fields of blenheim or the walls of prague we encircle we shoot bird flying they knock man down with apoplexy in the midst of his business or pleasure perhaps some of them are virtuosi and delight in the operations of an asthma human philosophers in the effects of an many merry bout have these frolic beings at the vicissitudes of an ague and good sport it is to see man tumble with an epilepsy and revive and tumble again and all this he knows not why perhaps now and then merry being may place hims elf in such situation to enjoy at once all the varieties of an epidemic disease or amuse his leisure with the tossings and contortions of every possible pain exhibited together it occurred to what bearish paws the old doctor in his gruff sport would lay upon modern spiritualists if he were about in these days i smiled to think what an inexhaustible theme skeptical wit was afforded by the awkward and tedious process of communication employed but after little reflection i said to myself is not the common action of spirit upon matter while we are here in the body quite inexplicable if we were not accustomed to it would it not seem nearly inconvenient and laborious the spirit which dwells within i know not where or how wishes to communicate with spirit dwelling in some other body in another part of the world straightway the instrument which we call hand is moved by spirit and promptly obeys the impulse it dips piece of pointed steel into black fluid and traces hieroglyphic characters invented by spirit to express its thought those letters have been formed into words by slow elaboration of the ages they partake of the climate where they grew in italy they flow smoothly water in russia they clink and clatter like iron hoofs upon pavement it appears that spirit must needs fashion its utterance according to the environment of matter in the midst of which it is placed by slow and toilsome process the child must learn what ideas those words represent otherwise he can scarcely be able to communicate at all with the spirits in other bodies near him if they are distant and his spirit wills to converse with them it must impel the instrument of bone and sinew to take up the pointed steel and trace on substance elaborately prepared from vegetable fibres certain mystic characters which according to their arrangement express love or hatred joy or sorrow if spirits out of the body indeed tip tables and rap the alphabet to communicate with spirits in the body it must be confessed that the machinery we poor mortals are obliged to employ in order to communicate with each other is nearly tedious and imperfect theirs ancient oriental philosophers and some of the gnostics at later period believed in gradation of successive worlds gradually diminishing in the force of spiritual intelligence and consequently in outward beauty they supposed that each world was an attenuated likeness sort of reflected image of the world above it that it must necessarily be so because in all its parts it was evolved from that world they believed that the inhabitant s of each world knew of those in the world next below them and were attracted toward them but that the world below was unconscious of the higher sphere whence it emanated swedenbor g teaches that all the inferior grades of being in this world are representative forms of the spiritual state of mankind and owe their existence to the thoughts and feelings in human souls thus if men had bad passions there would be lions and tigers and if they were inwardly pure there would be vermin in other words he teaches that the lower forms of nature are reflected images of man the orientals taught concerning successive worlds and in this case also the higher is attracted toward the lower and wishes to communicate with it while the lower remains ignorant of the existence of the higher i knew something of the swallows and wanted to talk with them but they knew nothing of 297 298 299 300 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https g teaches successive spheres of existence did the orientals though in another form he says spirits in the sphere nearest to this earth are attracted towa rds us and wish to communicate with us but that some of them are in low state and capable of great duplicity many people are satisfied with the theory that these are the spirits who are believed to be rapping and tipping tables in all parts of the country certain it is many of the phenomena that actually occur can not possibly be the result of jugglery though miracles sometimes seem to be performed by that adroit agency candid minds can not i think avoid the conclusion that spirit is acting upon matter in some way not explainable by any known laws of our being whether it is spirit in the body or out of the body seems difficult to decide the agents whoever they are are obviously nearly on level with our own spiritual condition they tell nothing which had not been previously known or imagined and they not always tell the truth minds of mystical tendencies find joy in believing that all inspirations in religion science or art come to us from above through the medium of ministering spirits who dwell in higher spheres of intelligence and love and are attracted towards us by our inward state the strength of evil which often leads men to think the devil drives them into some crime they account by supposing that the indulgence of wrong thoughts and feelings brings us into affinity with spirits below us who are thus enabled to influence our souls by the operation of laws universal and unchangeable those which regulate the attraction and repulsion of material substances rationalists on the other hand deem that all mental influences whether good or evil may be sufficiently accounted by the activity of the soul in any particular direction that the indulgence of any class of thoughts and feelings renders them continually stronger and stronger the pedestrian s leg or the s arm is invigorated by frequent use all these thoughts grew out of the removal of swallow s nest they left where they found temperament and early habits of thought inclined toward mystical theories while increasing caution learned by the experience of many fallacies beckoned toward the less poetical side of austere rationality i remained balanced between the opposite forces candidly willing to admit the claims of either i could only bow my head in reverent humility and say on these subjects we can not certainly know any thing in this imperfect state of being verily mysterious is the action of spirit upon spirit and of spirit upon matter i thus dismissed the subject from my mind voice from some corner of my soul said the swallows did not know that you took away their nest but you the kansas emigrants and unto thee in freedom s hour of sorest need god gives the power to ruin or to save to wound or heal to blight or bless with fruitful soil or wilderness free home or grave w hittier you are silent william said alice may to her lover they walked through green lane toward the setting sun yes dearest he replied i have that on my mind which makes after pause he added that book i was reading to you before these clouds tempted us out into the fields has made very strong impression on i never before realized how much depends on the state of mind we are in when we read the story of our forefathers was all familiar to and i always reverenced the puritans but the grandeur of their character never loomed up before my mental vision it does now with all their faults they were noble set of men and women and what has anointed your eyes to see this more clearly than ever asked alice all the while i was reading i was thinking of john bradford s project of going to kansas and while we have been walking in the fields my eyes have involuntarily turned away from the glorious sunset clouds to glance at the neat dwellings dotted all over the landscape to the mill whirling sparkling water into the air to the with its broad to the 301 302 303 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https gleaming brightly in the sun all these we owe to those heroic pilgrims who left comfortable homes in england and came to howling wilderness to establish principle of freedom and what they have done massachusetts john bradford and his companions may kansas it is glorious privilege to help in laying the foundation of states on basis of justice and i see that john has magnetized you with his enthusiasm she replied and he has magnetized cousin kate also how brave she is to think of following him with their little child kate is hopeful by temperament said william but i think she is hardly more brave than you are you are both afraid of snake and i was thinking more of the long journey the parting from friends and living among strangers than i was of snakes and guns replied alice then everybody says there are so many discom forts and hardships in new country and the indians william only think of going within sound of the indian war the indians are in very different state now he replied from what they were when the puritan women followed their husbands into the wilderness of this new world they are few in numbers now their spirit has been tamed by accumulated wrongs and they are too well aware of the power of the united states government to make any aggressions upon those who are under its protection besides you know it is my opinion that the indians never would have made unprovoked aggressions who can read catlin s account without being struck with the nobility of character often manifested by their race i am fully persuaded that it is easy to make firm friends of the indians by treating them with justice and kindness and with that personal respect which they so well know how to he pressed her arm to his side and took her hand within his he added you seemed greatly to admire that young puritan bride who cheerfully left home and friends behind her and crossed the tempestuous ocean to brave cold and hunger by her husband s side in wilderness where wolves and savages were her hand trembled within his something in the earnestness of his look and the tender modulation of his tones suddenly revealed to her what was passing in his mind she knew he was not thinking of cousin john s wife while he spoke thus of the pilgrim s bride it was the first time that such possibility had been suggested to her mind and it made the blood run cold in her veins after painful pause she said with forced calmness of voice we often admi re virtues we are not strong enough to he pressed her hand and remained silent till an outburst of tears made him stop suddenly and fold her to his heart don t weep my beloved he said i will never require or even ask such sacrifice of you such delicate flower you are needs to be sheltered from the blast and the storm but you have conjectured rightly deares t that my heart is set upon accompanying these emigrants i feel that all there is of manhood within will be developed by the exigencies of such career my character and my destiny will grow more grand with the responsibilities that will devolve upon if i remain here i never shall half i am capable of doing myself and posterity to speak the plain truth dear alice i have something of the old puritan feeling that god calls to this work you have promised to be my wife within few weeks but i absolve you from that promise if you prefer it i will go and prepare comfortable home you in that new region and endeavour to draw circle of our mutual friends around before i ask you to leave your new england she looked up at him through her tears with glance which seemed to say you then suppose there can be any hardship so great separation from the one i love best in the world he understood the mute appeal and answered it by saying don t be rash clear alice reflect upon it till next sunday evening and then tell what is your decision i shall not love you one particle the less if you tell that years must pass before you can be the partner of my life duties excitements lapse of time can remove your image from my few more words were spoken they returned homeward lighted by the crescent moon it was not until long after midnight that alice fell asleep to dream of standing by wide chasm vainly stretching her hand toward william on the other side during the following days she asked counsel save of god and her mother her mother laid her hand tenderly on her head and said i dare not advise you follow your own heart my child and when she prayed to god she seemed to hear an echo of those words she saw william often but she spoke word to dissuade him from his purpose had he been going to california to dig gold she would have had much to say in favour of the humblest home under the protection of the old 304 305 306 307 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https commonwealth but he had spoken so seriously of his sense of duty that her womanly nature reverenced the manliness of his convictions and she prayed that his courage to dare might be equalled by her fortitude to endure it rained heavily on sunday evening so that the lovers could not take their accustomed walk and the presence of others prevented confidential interview but when they parted at the door alice slipped small package into william s hand when he arrived at home he opened it with nervous haste and found small bible with mark withi n it an anchor was embroidered on the mark with the word faith beneath it and his eye was caught by pencil lines on the page encircling the words where thou goest i will go where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god bless her he exclai med now i can go forward with an undivided he kissed the anchor again and again and bowing his head on his hands he wept he had not wept since boyhood to his deep and earnest nature love and duty were sacred realities great was the joy of cousin kate and her husband when it was known that william bruce had determined to join the band of emigrants and that alice had acquiesced william was young man of such good judgment and stedfast principles that they all felt he would be in the machinery of any society where he moved john bradford was equally good and true but his temperament induced more volubility of speech and more eagerness of action when the band of emigrants heard of william s decision they said laughingly to each other now we shall have both moses and aaron to guide us into kate s widowed mother and younger brother and sister resolved to join the enterprising band little nephew of five years old was of the same mind and when told that he was too small to be of any use he declared himself fully able to catch bear alice s father and mother had prospecti ve plans of following their daughter accompanied by their oldest son in case those who went before them should send up good report of the land her adhesive affections suffered terribly in this rupture of old ties but in such natures love takes possession of the whole being she would have sacrificed life itself william all her friends knew it was harder her than others to go into strange land and enter into entirely new modes of existence therefore they all spoke hopefully to her and one but william ever presented the clouded side of the picture to her view he did it from conscientious scruple lest she should go forward in the enterprise with eyes blinded to its difficulties but the hardships he described in such tender tones never seemed like hardships his warnings were always met with the affectionate response what proud and happy woman i shall be dear william if i can any thing to sustain you through the trials you will have to encounter she never spoke despondingly never told the fears that sometimes swarmed in her imagination if she could not strengthen him she at least would not unnerve him she said to herself and cousin kate she would have been ashamed to acknowledge to her what faint heart was beating within her bosom kate who had earned her own living ever since she was sixteen and assisted her widowed mother and educated her younger brother and sister in manner well adapted to make them useful and active members of society was just the woman to emigrate to the west sometimes alice sighed and wished she was more like kate she did not know how many anxious thoughts were concealed under her cousin s cheerful tones her bright frank smile and her ener getic preparations departure thick and fast came in the parting memorials from relatives and schoolmates and what showers of tears fell upon them they were stowed away in the closely packed chests that last night at the old homesteads oh how the memories crowded upon those suffocated hearts when alice stole out in the moonlight and wept while she kissed the old elm from whose boughs she had swung in childhood she did not know that the roots were already moistened with katie s tears to the experienced and the thoughtful all weddings are solemn occasions when they see the young unmooring their boat from its old fastenings and floating away so gaily on the stream they know full well that shadows are ahead and that many rock lies hidden under the bright waters the marriage of william and alice was solemn even to sadness they were to depart kansas on the morrow the farewell moment had been so dreaded days preceding that all felt if it would be relief to have the agony over alice clung to her parents the drowning cling the mother lifted up her voice and wept and the old father choked he strove to say very pleasant hast thou been unto god bless thee my but cousin katie whose mission it was to strengthen everybody came up and pressed their hands and said good bye dear uncle good bye dear aunt we ll make beautiful home you in kansas and willie and ally will come to bring you to 308 309 310 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https they mounted the wagons children who used to attend bradford s school came up with bunches of violets and the little nephew who thought himself such mighty hunter called out send bear oh yes geor gy replied kate w ill you have him roasted i want to tie him up in the darden and feed him shouted geor ge but one heard him the wagons had rolled away before he finished the sentence and those who watched them forgot that any thing else existed the last glimpse of alice showed her head bowed down on her husband s shoulder her waist encircled by his arm the last tones of katie s voice had been strong and clear and one but her john saw how the tears rained down on her infant s face they rode through their native village they had never fully realized until now how beautiful were the elms in the delicate verdure of spring how precious were the golden blossoms profusely strewn over the meadows how happy and safe the homes seemed to nestle in the scenery they passed the church all turned and looked back at that place of pleasant meetings with relatives friends and neighbours they will miss our voices in the choir dear william said alice yes he replied but by the blessing of god we will sing hymns in the wilder ness and waken musical echoes among the silent and we will sing home sweet home together said alice with faint smile we ll all join in the tune said katie and john who is up to all sort fixens the westerners say will make some new variations on purpose the occasion then came the bustle of dep√¥ts the whizzing of steam and visions of fields and hills racing away usual the hearts that went recovered serenity sooner than the hearts left behind the new excitement of travelling waked up hope who shoved memory aside awhile and produced from her portfolio series of sketches painted in colours more prismatic than rossiter s they talked of the genial climate and beautiful scener y of kansas and foretold that it would be the italy of the western world i hope it will be like italy only in its externals said kate i trust there will be lazaroni monks banditti despots to imprison men talking about the laws that govern why you want to make new italy of it inquired alice what better destiny can you wish it than to be like our dear new england nothing better can be wished it rejoined william had i not been deeply impressed with the conviction that the institutions and manners and consequent welfare of states depend greatly on the character of first settlers i should never have encouraged emigration from the old commonwealth by my own but the climate and scenery of italy would be an improvement to massachusetts said john if we could have it without losing the active soul and strong muscle of new england that is it exactly john rejoined katie we will have it young new englan d but it shall be under sunny skies with italian several days passed before the emigrants began to be much aware of the discomforts and fatigue of long journey the babies crowed and seemed to think the huge machine was invented expressly to furnish them with pleasanter motion than cradle or while maturer minds found amusement in observing the passengers that came and went and pleasure in the varying scenery they were whirled along past the thriving farms of new york the tall forests of canada and the flower prairies of illinois but after while even the strongest became aware of aching bones and the most active minds grew drowsy the excessive weariness of the last days pen can adequately describe the continuous motion of the cars without change of posture the disturbed night on board steamboats full of crying children the slow floating over missouri waters now wheeling round to avoid snag now motionless hours on waiting the drifting tide while twilight settles darkly down over uninhabited forests stretching away in the dim distance the hurry and scramble of arriving at strange places farther and farther away from home and always with dreary feeling at their hearts that home awaited them if i could only make it seem if we were going anywhere i don t think i should feel so tired said alice with kind of weary bewilderment in the expression of her sweet countenance worn out katie was she summoned cheerful smile and replied keep up brave heart alice dear those who are going nowhere are pretty sure to 311 312 313 314 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https eight days travel they arrived at kansas city in missouri there they bade adieu to cars and steamboats and entered the indian territory closely stowed away in great wagons covered with and furnished with rough boards seats in some places the road swept along in graceful curves through miles of smooth open prairie belted with noble trees and sprinkled with wild flowers copiously from summer shower the charming nove lty of the scene was greeted with outburst of delight from all the weary party even the quiet alice clapped her hands and exclaimed how beautiful without adding with sigh but it isn t like dear new william smiled affectionately at her enthusiastic surprise and said virtuous and industrious people can build up happy homes in such solitudes these dear anon they descended into deep ravines which jolted the rough boards and knocked their heads together through these steep passes the wagons were jerked by patient mules till they were brought into streams whose uncertain depths made the women and children scream or into creeks sparkling in the sunshine whose shallow waters covered holes easier to pass by leaving the wagons and jumping from stone to stone then scrambling up another steep bank they found marks of wheels to indicate road they packed themselve s into the huge wagons again with their baskets and babies bread and cheese and went tumbling along with bonnets knocked into ats and hats that had lost all appearance of being katie was conjecturing now and then how many bowls and plates would arrive in kansas unbroken while alice had foggy idea that they were going nowhere but there was rainbow across the fog because william was going there too tired out in mind and body they came at last to the river wakarusa which they crossed slowly at the and rode up bank that seemed steep enough to set the wagons on end this brought them into fields of grass dotted here and there with small cabins to new england eyes it presented little resemblance to village but it was called town and bore the honoured name of franklin few miles to the left smoothly rounded hills rose on the horizon one behind the other between those beautiful hills and the banks of the river was the infant town of lawrence the destined capital of free kansas here the travellers rested to greet old friends who had preceded them and to form plans the future they all agreed that more beautiful nestling place village had rarely been seen and really considering it was little more than eight months old it had quite look there were several neat houses and many cabins the appearance of which indicated industrious inmates who would rapidly increase their comforts and enlar ge their borders the bright river made graceful curve fringed with trees which the skill of man could not have arranged so tastefully nature had done hills rose to the horizon in gradually ascending series their verdant slopes lighted up with golden sunshine one of grander propor tions than the others called blue mound was immediately singled out by bradford the site of future free state university and his equally minded wife forthwith matured the plan by proposing that william bruce should be its first president and her baby become professor of some ology or other i am afraid we can t wait long enough him replied her husband smiling we shall have to choose you professor kate i one will give you my the rough hands of the settlers and their coarse garments soiled with prairie mud were offensive to kate s ideas of neatness and still more so to the delicate tastes of alice but on sundays when they were dressed in their best and met together to read and sing they looked like quite different people they became more acquainted it was an agreeable surprise to find so large proportion of them intelligent and well educated with pervading character of sobriety industry and enterprise they seemed to require nothing but time and small allowance of that to build up thriving towns and form prosperous state certainly the manner of living was rude many of them ate their dinner from boards laid across the tops of barrels the labour also was hard there was much to and few to it and yet wells were not dug or machinery introduced but where all worked one felt his dignity lessened by toil they had the most essential element of prosperous state the respectability of labour the next most important element they also had they placed high value on education and were willing to sacrifice much to secure it their children the absence of conventional forms and the constant exercise of ingenuity demanded by the inconveniences and emer gencies of settler s life have wonderful effect in producing buoyancy and energy of character the tendency to hope every thing and the will to every thing desirable to be done were so contagious that alice was surprised to discover the amount of her hitherto undeveloped capabilities 315 316 317 318 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https was cabin sale built by one of the earliest settlers who had died of fever its picturesque situation on rising groun d overlooking the river was attractive to bradford and his wife and it became their home it consisted of one long room with loft above from which it was separated by floor of boards the long room was converted into two by cotton curtain running on iron rings and the loft was divided into two apartments in the same manner when these arrangements were completed it afforded temporary shelter the two families of katie and alice including eight persons in the absence of closets it was necessary to hang all sorts of articles from the boards above dried salt fish was near neighbour to very pretty and bag of potatoes was suspended between new quilt and handsome i hope we shall soon be able to stow the salt fish and potatoes away somewhere said alice oh never mind replied katie laughing if hans christian andersen would only come this way he would make fine story about the salt fish falling in love with the pretty basket and becoming thinner every day because his genteel neighbour preferred the and took pains to conceal her disgust of his vulgar appearance and disagreeable breath she listen to the vows of salt fish not she did nt he know that her handsome relative the from brussels had done good make proposals to her then the poor fish would be stimulated to hunt up pedigree he might claim to have descended from jonah s whale he on his part might feel his dignity offended by the neighbourhood of dirty potatoes and the potatoes like sturdy republicans might tell him they did not care darn his pedigree they should like to know whether he could grow if he could nt he was an old fogy and the less he said the better he was among folks that believed in growing and did nt believe in any thing alice laughed at her conceits and said it was blessing to have such lively companion in lonesome place soon the first hurry was over the men of the family converted into shelves books and utensils and made divers stools with cotton cloth and unpeeled boughs of wood after the fashion of portable there was talk of table to be hewn from black walnut tree but yet the tree was growing and boards on must answer meanwhile the were broken when the wagons were pitching down some of the ravines but the shell of turtle which kate s brother thomas had brought among his traps made tolerable substitute the women missed the smoo th white and the orderly arrangement of dishes to which they had been accustomed but they agreed with the men that food had ever tasted so good the venison and wild game cooked in that humble cabin where they mutually served each other in love then the unpacking of the deep trunks and boxes bringing to light memorials of old places and dear friends was pleasure which only the emigrant from home may realize some mutual secrets had been kept which made little sunny ripples of surprise in their quiet stream of life alice s father and mother had packed their photograph likenesses in katie s trunk with charge that they should not be opened till they were settled in their new home katie had pressed mosses and ferns from the old well near uncle may s they were twined with pendant blossoms from the old elm and woven into garland round the words from the well whose waters katie and allie drank in childhood and from the old from whose boughs they used to she had framed it neatly with cones gathered in pine grove where they had walked together many an hour these souvenirs of the dear old home so stirred the deep fountains of feeling in her cousin s soul that she burst into tears but katie soon made her laugh by exhibiting crockery bear which little geor gy had packed among the things to remind them of the living bear he expected to receive from kansas alice said she had little secret too she retreated to her division of the room and brought forth of the house where katie was born and where her mother had always lived and across the green lane was uncle may s house with the old well shaded by the elm she had talent drawing and the dear familiar scene was brought faithfully before the eye though little idealized by the softness of the shading dear exclaimed the vivacious katie how can i put it where i can see it often yet contrive to keep it free from smoke and dust she gave forlorn kind of glance at the unplastered walls through chinks of which glimpses of the sky were visible the fact was neither they nor their friends had been aware of the rough conditions of settler s life and the cousins had brought with them many pretty little keepsakes which they could find places but it was rule with them to utter complaints to add to the weight of cares already resting on their noble husbands so the forlorn look quickly gave place to smile kate kissed her cousin and said i ll tell you what i will allie dear i will keep it in my 319 320 321 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https it is lar ge place and blesses all it keeps that i can bear witness to said john there was need that the women of kansas should overlook their own inconveniences and be silent about their own sufferings thunder was gathering over the heads of the emigrants and every week it grew blacker and black er it needed less quickness of observation than katie possessed to perceive almost immediately after their arrival that they were surrounded by dangerous enemies her husband knowing the reliable strength of her character did not hesitate to confide to her his anxieties and fears kansas but far possible they kept danger out of sight in their conversations with alice they had seen proof enough that she was strong in with abundant fortitude to endure those she loved but they knew that the od of her soul was in her affections and that perils in her husband s path would undermine the strength she needed her own her busy hands were almost entirely employed with occupations sewing and mending the whole family keeping the rooms tidy and assisting about the daily cooking if it was necessary to purchase pail or pan or any other household convenience it was katie who sallied forth into massachusetts street to examine such articles were sale at the little shanty shops if water was wanted when the men were absent she put on her deep and took the pail to the nearest spring nearly quarter of mile distant there was so much work pressing to be done in lawrence that yet there had been time found to construct wells and the water of the river became shallow and turbid under the summer sun these excursions were at first amusing from their novelty and she came home with lively account of missouri and indian squaws with bags full of papooses strapped to their shoulders but gradually the tone of merriment subsided and when she had occasion to go into the street she usually returned silent and thoughtful missourians from the neighbouring border scowled at her she passed and took pleasure in making their horses rear and plunge across her path in the little shops she often found more or less of these ruffians with hair unkempt and beards like squirting in every direction and interlarding their conversation with oaths and curses every one that entered was hailed with the interrogatory stranger whar ar yer from if their answer indicated any place north of the ohio and east of the mississippi the response was damn yer holler yankees what business have you in these diggens you d better clar out i tell yer on one of these occasions dirty drunk en fellow said to kate they tell you are an smart woman are you or you go in the abolitionists concealing the disgust she felt she quietly replied i wish to see kansas free state because i have her prosperity at damn yer imperdence exclaimed the brute i should like to see you chained up with one of our niggers i ll be cussed if i would nt help to and he finished by stooping down and squirting quantity of into her face there was another missourian in the shop tall burly looking cattle drover with long whip in his hand he seized the other roughly by the arm saying i tell you what my boy that s puttin it on little too thick i m if you re far fight with the yankees tom thorpe s the man yer work but i m down on all sich fixens let the woman alone the rowdy drew his with volley of oaths and katie darted from the shop leaving her purchases uncompleted when she returned she found her mother busy about dinner and alice sitting at the window making coarse frock she raised her head and smiled when her cousin entered but immediately looked out toward mount oread when she first saw that verdant slope she had fallen in love with its beauty then she had been attracted by the classic name conferred on it by scholar among the emigrants there was something romantic in thus transp orting the mountain spirits of ancient greece into the loveliest portions of this new western world william often quoted leigh hunt s verses about the oreads that frequent the lifted mountains and er deep ravines sit listening to the talking streams below then governor robinson s house on the brow of the hill was pleasant object in the scenery he was courteous and cultivated man with good library always at their disposal there was so much quiet gentle strength about him that his presence seemed to ensure protection the last and 322 323 324 325 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https reason why alice loved mount oread was that william had taken land little beyond it and there was to be their future home snug bird s nest in sunny nook of greenery he was building cabin there and every day she saw him descending toward lawrence with the axe on his shoulder and he came nearer she could hear him whistling home sweet she was watching him now and hoping he would return in season dinner therefore she had not noticed the flurried manner with which kate hastened to wash her face and wipe the tobacco stains from her bonnet while she was thus employed the old lady said to her youngest daughter flora go and call john and thomas from the field dinner is nearly ready mother exclaimed katie never send her out never perceiving that her quick emphatic manner had arrested the attent ion of all the inmates of her dwelling she added in lower tone i will go but her words had aroused train of thoughts which was becoming more and more familiar to alice the men in the vicinity often came to ask council of bradford and bruce and of course their talk was mainly concerning the neighbouring state of missouri she heard them tell how ruffians and rowdies came over the border with and pistols to drive the free citizens of kansas away from the polls to deprive them of liberty to make their own laws and compel them to be governed by the code of missouri which in many ways violated their moral sense she heard them say that spies from missouri were in every neighbourhood watching those emigrants who dared to say any thing in favour of having the soil of kansas free why was katie so flushed and flurried was the danger approaching nearer than she was aware of she turned anxiously toward mount oread and longed sight of william what if he should not return till after he whose honest mouth would never utter word that was false to freedom whatever might be his personal risk unable to keep back the crowding tears she slipped behind the cotton curtain that screened their sleeping apartment and kneeling beside their rude couch she prayed earnestly to god to protect her husband william had not arrived when they sat down to dine and his wife made various pretences rising to remove plate or bring cup of water but in reality to look out upon mount oread at last she heard his voice and rushed out to meet him with an outburst of emotion that surprised them all john shook his head mournfully and sighed he said poor alice how she idolizes him katie had the discretion not to mention her rencontre with the border ruffian to any but her husband who grew red in the face and clenched his fist while he listened but immediately subsided into calmer mood and said we must be careful never to lose sight of the best interests of kansas in our resentment at the wrongs and insults we are continually receiving we will give these lawless rascals excuse molesting us and wait with patience the american government to protect its unof fending on the afternoon of the same day gawky lad with long nine in his mouth and hands in his trowsers pockets came to the door saying the ole woman s tuk wi fits almighty strong and the ole man wants you to cum and bring along some yer doctor s stuff he s heern tell that yer death on bradford had become so accustom ed to the estern lingo that she understood the ole man to be the lad s father she knew very well that he was missouri spy of the lowest order an accomplice in many villainous proceedings against the citizens of kansas she felt loathing of the whole family not unmingled with resentment but she rose quickly to prepare the medicines thinking to herself what hypocrisy it is to profess to be believer in christianity if i can not cheerfully return good evil in such case she administered relief to the sufferer tenderly if she had been her own sister and the poor woman expressed gratitude it in her uncouth way when kate remarked that they would feel more kindly toward the yankees if they knew them better she replied i allers tole my ole man i wished they wouldn t keep up such muss but lor what the use speakin it s jist like spittin agin the that night bradford s horse and saddle were stolen they never knew by whom but they were afterward seen in missouri in the midst of discouragements and dangers the brave band of settlers went on with their work better stores were erected and one after another the temporary cabins gave place to comfortable stone houses 326 327 328 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https emigrant aid society had been formed in the north whose object it was to assist in the erection of mills and other buildings the public benefit their motive was partly financial inasmuch all such improvem ents rapidly increased the value of property in kansas and they were well aware that the outward prosperity well the moral strength of state depended greatly upon encouraging emigrants to go from communities where they had been accustomed to free institutions educational privileges orderly habits and salutary laws their motives in extending helping hand to these infant colonies were both morally good and worldly wise there was partiality in their management of affairs emigrants from the southern states shared their benefits equally with those from the north settlers were pouring in from all sections of the country but chiefly from the north and west because the hardy inhabitants of those states are always ready enterprise and toil many of them had large families of children and the small tavern called the cincinnati house was quite insuf ficient to afford them shelter while cabins were prepared them in the course of their first summer john bradford and his band of pilgrims had the satisfaction of seeing noble stone hotel of three stories rise in massachusetts street making the place beautiful with its glazed windows and doors of polished black walnut unfortunately the only route to kansas by or steamboat passed through missouri were continually plundered and letters broken open and destroyed by the border ruffians supplies of provisions purchased by the settlers or sent to them by their friends went to enrich their enemies money enclosed in letters met with the same fate still the settlers of kansas pursued pacific course toward their persecutors they came from communities where laws were reliable protection and following their old habits they appealed to the laws desirous at all hazards not to involve the country in civil war this conscientious patriotism was not appreciated the banditti on the borders laughed it to scorn while the slaveholding gentlemen and statesmen who used them puppets to the disgraceful work they were ashamed to openly themselves smiled at the yankees reverence the union and successfully played their old game of practicing on conscientious love of country in order to tighten the serpent coil of slavery more securely about the neck of freedom missourians had voted their own creatures into most of the offices of kansas some of them pitched tent in that territory while while others did not even assume the appearance of residing there from such officers of justice the citizens of kansas could find redress the robberies and wrongs continually inflicted on them by the band of ruffians commissioned to drive them out of the territory by any means that would it most effectually our wrongs from the british government were slight compared with theirs still these western colonies refrained from revolution they sent agents to washington with d evidence of their outrageous wrongs they received fair words and relief every day it became more evident that the president of the united states was in league with the power that was crush ing free kansas the missourians emboldened by their knowledge of this fact played their bad game more and more openly they paid men dollar day with plenty of whiskey and free passage across the ferries to go into kansas and vote down the rights of the citizens more and more the conviction grew upon the people of kansas that they could not trust the government of the united states and consequently had only their own energies to rely upon they published paper called the herald of freedom in which they maintained the right of all american citizens to choose their own magistrates and make their own laws they rejected the legislators imposed upon them by the rabble of missouri at the point of the bayonet they declared that large majority of the settlers were desirous to have kansas free state and that they would maintain their right to be heard to this paper john bradford and william bruce were constant contributors and kate s brother thomas was diligent in setting the types of course the family became odious to those who were bent on driving freedom out of kansas convention of the citizens of the territory was called at topeka there were representatives from nearly all sections of the union emigrants from carolina virginia and missouri agreed with emigrants from ohio and massachusetts that the introduction of slavery would prove disastrous to the prosperity of the state they framed constitution kansas and chose legislators some required that free coloured people should be excluded from the territory well slaves others deemed that such regulation would be an infringement upon freedom and urged that man could calculate the future bad consequences of introducing one wrong principle into the basis of their government one urged this point more strenuously than did william bruce in his mild firm way but southern emigrants were opposed to that view of the case and the 329 330 331 332 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https desirous to concede far possible yet unwilling to introduce such clause into their constitution concluded to leave that question to the votes of the people it was trying time the women in lawrence the wisest and bravest men were absent in topeka which was miles further up the river the convention excited great wrath in missouri they called themselves lovers of law and order and denounc ed those traitors who dared to make other laws than those imposed upon them with and revolvers the wildest stories were circulated the most moderate of them was rumour that bruce insisted upon having niggers become members of the legislature this they regarded the greatest monstrosity republican could be guilty of they were blind to the fact that hundreds of coloured slaves could be found who were more fit the office than the white ones they had appointed to rule over kansas insults multiplied and curses and threats grew louder every family in lawrence went to bed each night with the feeling that they might be murdered before morning when the delegates returned john bradford thought his wife seemed at least ten years older than when she came to kansas the preceding spring the baby who could now toddle alone had caught the trick of fear and hid himself when his father knocked at the fastened door william was alarmed to find alice so thin and pale and to see her gentle eyes look so large and frightened he folded her closely in his arms and she wept upon his bosom he said my wife my loving and generous wife how i reproach myself accepting the sacrifice you offered yet had i foreseen this state of things i never would have consented that you should follow into don t say that she exclaimed nervou sly it will be easier to die with you than it would have been to live without you but oh william why need they persecute us so there are thousands of acres of land uncultivated in missouri what makes them covet our land ah dearest it is complicated question and you don t understand it they care little the land except means of increasing their political power they want more slave states to be represented by slaveholders in the coun cils of the union and they not want that any more free states should come into the union to balance their influence therefore they are not content with stretching their dominions to the gulf of mexico and seizing texas they wish to grasp the northern territories also that they may be secure of keeping the free states in political subjection it is long story my love many years they have been artfully availing themselves of every means to increase their power the antagonistic principles of slavery and freedom have come to here in kansas and you my delicate little flower are here to be trampled in the alice sighed and wished she was more like kate then she would not be such weight upon his spirits but he declared that he would not the world have her in any way different from her own dear self then they fell to talking about their future home which was now in readiness two of william s brothers had arrived with their families an addition to the cabin had been built one of them and the other would live within call katie was loth to part from her cousin but she said they would be far more comfortable in their new quarters and safety there was safety nowhere least of all in lawrence gradually they fell into more cheerful strain of conversation the husbands spoke hopefully and really felt so they had strong faith that their beautiful kansas would become free and prosperous state various boxes from massachusetts directed to william bruce had arrived in kansas city some of them contained comfortables and blankets the winter which may had prepared her darling daughter her stray lamb in the wilderness she was wont to call her could all that mother s thoughts and feelings have been daguerreotyped on the cloth while those stitches were taken it would have been an epic poem of wondrous pathos what visions of alice sleeping in her cradle of her wakening smile of her soft curls waving in the summer breeze she came running with flower of her girlish bloom delicate the blossom of her clear melodious voice in the choir at church of the bashful blushing ways that betrayed her dawning love william of the struggle in her soul when she must choose between him and her parents of her parting look when she turned from the home of her childhood to follow her husband into the wilderness in alice s soul those stitches by the old fond faithful hand would also waken poem of reminiscences how she longed those boxes to see what mother had sent her above all the letters from dear new england especially the long letter from mother 333 334 335 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https was agreed that william s brothers should go with wagon to bring them they reached kansas city in safety and the boxes were delivered to them passing through franklin on their re turn they found fifty or sixty missouri ruffians carousing round built of logs man with ragged trowsers and dirty checked shirt too tipsy to stand alone was leaning against corner of the shop scraping fiddle while his comrades sung we ve camped in the wilderness few days few days and then we re going home we ve right up yonder we ll vote and shoot the yankees few days few days and then we re going home we ve right up yonder soon this drunken crew espied the wending its way toward kansas they set up frightful yell and making rush at the horses called out hallo stranger whar are you going and what are you toting to lawrence with load of household goods they replied that s damned nest of yankee abolitionists cried one we re gwine to wipe it out shouted another the goods must be overhauled boys bawled third it was vain to remonstrate and useless to fight against such desperate odds they unloaded the wagons tore open the boxes and pulled out the home treasures which would have been so precious to alice the young men pleaded hard the letters but the mob said they must carry them to the governor to see if there was treason in them the governor shall be informed of this and if there s justice to be obtained in the land we ll have it said the brothers shut up you damned rascals shoute d the rabble git into yer waggin and be off or we ll stop yer jawing poor alice the blessed words warm from her mother s heart that would have poured such balm into her own would be used to light the pipes of missouri ruffians the quilts so neatly made by those dear old hands would be spread on muddy floors drunken revels it was hard to bear but she knew this was only one of thousand wrongs and she said i will never murmur while my dear good william is spared to from the time of her betrothal her lovin g heart had dreamed of neat little wedded home cozy and comfortable with few simple adornments of pictures and vases the cabins of kansas with their rough floors brown with prairie mud had driven away the illusion but still it hovered there over mount oread and the mountain spirits seemed to sing prophetic song of love and peace in sunny future she found the new home provided with more conveniences than the one she had left william in the midst of all his cares never forgot her and snatched an hour whenever he could to work her comfort it was the morning of sunny day when they entered their new abode and all things looked neat and cheerful william who was reverential by temperament viewed all the common duties and affairs of life in religious light they stood moment hand in hand gazing at the humble little cabin with moistened eyes then he removed his hat and looking earnestly to heaven he threw water on the roof saying i baptize thee the freeman s home may the blessing of god descend upon thee there was saddened pleasure in thus consecrating their encampment in the wilderness in lawrence darker and darker yet the storm was lowering autumn was coming on with heavy dews and cold winds from the mountains swept across the open prairie whistling through the loopholes of the fragile cabins they went the dampness and the chill brought with them that dreadful demon of the settler s life fever and ague the arms of strong men were palsied by it and the little children looked like blossoms blighted by sudden frost the active katie found time to run hither and thither with gruel and medicine though her own little one was shivering if his joints would fall asunder many murmured blessing followed her footsteps from cabin to cabin and many grateful tear fell on her hand from souls sorrowful even unto 336 337 338 339 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https in the midst of this calamity rumours of invasion by the missourians increased daily in john bradford s cabin all slept so lightly that the slightest unusual sound startled them to instant wakefulness the distant whoop of indians on the prairie and the howling of hungry wolves disturbed them not they were in dread of more infernal sound than these the midnight yell of border ruffians few weeks after the departure of alice they were waked from uneasy slumbers by that frightful noise at the very walls of their cabin katie rose hastily and laying her sick child on the floor covered him with thick cotton comfortable hoping that the if they whizzed through the cabin would either fly over him or lose their force in the wadding there was random shot but the ball stuck in the boards at their bed s head the next moment the door was burst open by twenty or thirty men armed with and revolvers never out of the infernal pit was heard such volley of blasphemy and obscenity poured from their foul mouths the purport of it all was that they had sworn to wipe out lawrence and that they had come to shoot this damned yankee abolitionist who had had the impudence to write in the paper that kansas would yet be free state they attempted to seize bradford but his wife threw herself across him and said if you murder him it shall be through my heart s they struck her with their fists they tried to pull her away but she clung with convulsive power that was too strong them her brother thomas was out that night watching with neighbour who was down with fever and ague and it had been previously arranged that young flora and her mother should remain hidden in the loft in case of such an emergency screams ascended to their ears katie had outgrown woman s weakness but the listening mother heard the scuffle below and bidding flora to hide in the darkest corner she haste ned down the ladder and threw her arms round john and katie saying you shall kill they cursed her and spit at her and knocking the from her head made mockery of her gray hairs the lurid light of their torch fell on the scene and all the while the wailing of the sick child was heard mammy johnny s faid mammy johnny s faid how the struggle might have ended none can tell had not tall figure suddenly burst into the room exclaiming boys i m down on all sich fixens let the women alone i ll be darned if i don t like to see woman stick to her husband in trouble if he is damned abolitionist let her alone i tell ye wait till the time comes far fight it s all fired mean boys sich posse arter one man and two seeing the human wolves reluctant to quit their prey he brandished and exclaimed in thundering voice i tell ye what boys if ye don t let them ar women alone i ll pitch into yer sure my name s tom thorpe this remonstrance excited feeling of shame in some of the gang while others were willing enough to avoid quarrel with such powerful antagonist the ruffians thus adjured swaggered away saying we nt afeerd tom thorpe or the they swore frightful oaths smashed kate s small stock of crockery and seized whatever they could lay hands on they went and all the while the sick babe was wailing mammy johnny s faid mammy johnny s faid kate took the poor attenuated child in her arms those arms so strong few moments ago were trembling now and tears were dropping from the eyes that lately glared so sternly on her husband s enemies tom thorpe lingered moment and was turning silently away when she rose with the child resting on her shoulder and took his hand in hers i thank you thorpe she said this is the second time you have protected from insult and injury i will never forget it and if helpless missourian should ever need my aid though he be the worst of border ruffians i will remember tom thorpe and help him his sake i am sorry you stand up slaver y you seem to have soul too noble that i am sure if you lived in free state while you would be convinced that slavery has bad ef fect on all concerned in the mother here laid her hand on his arm and said we are persecuted people thorpe persecuted without provocation and i believe something in your own heart tells you so god bless you what you have done bradford who had been looking through the chinks in the wall to watch the course the ruffians had taken now came up to add his thanks and ask him if he would take any refreshment thankee stranger said tom i ve casion i ve been drovin cattle roun in the territory and i knows that ar yell of theirn so i thought i d jist cum and see what they was cuttin up i m down on all sich fixens allers tole the boys so tom thorpe s fur far fight says 340 341 342 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https bradford tried to convince him that the inhabitants of kansas wished to be peaceable just and kind in their dealings with the missourians and with all men and that there was need of fair fight and excuse ruffian violence and kate threw in an argument now and then to aid her husband but tom thorpe had the idea firmly fixed inside his shaggy head that far fight was somehow necessary the honor of missouri though he was unable to explain why the mighty drover rolled the quid in his mouth passed huge hand through his thick mass of hair and strode out into the darkness repeating tom thorpe s down on all sich he walked along he muttered to himself that ar s an almighty smart woman what fetchin up she must had such fetchin up in our diggins i m myself but them ar use feller all up i swar i bleeve they re more n half right i ll be darned if i don meanwhile the inmates of the cabin were canvassing his merits he passed out of the door katie said there goes an honest kind heart under that rough exterior little foggy about right and wrong replied her husband but with instincts like powerful and generous that s owing to his fetchin up they say rejoined kate what man he might have made if he had been brought up under free institutions bless your generous soul ejaculated john but tell now truly katie don t you begin to be sorry we ever came to kansas she raised her eyes to his and said calmly john never the more i know of those missouri ruffians the more deeply i feel that it is worth the sacrifice of many lives to save this fair territory from the blighting curse of slavery true steel true steel exclaimed john giving her hearty kiss how manfully you stood by how womanfully you mean she replied smiling i assure you kate it required more courage to refrain from seizing my rifle than it would have done to dischar ge its contents among those rascals though we stand pledged to avoid bloodshed i verily believe i should have broken my pledge if your voice had not pleaded all the time don t john don t oh if the government at washington would only its duty sighed kate how can they trifle thus with the lives of innocent citizens it s worse than that rejoined her husband their influence protects the wolfish pack slavery always has need of to keep down the love of freedom in the human soul and these border ruf fians are its human i wonder whether frank pierce has any small children said katie if he has i wish he and his wife could have heard the feeble voice of this little one in the midst of those shocking oaths and curses calling out mammy johnny s faid god of mercy shall i ever forget that sound she drew the sleeping child to her heart with gentle pressure and the tears of father and mother fell fast upon him the grandmother sat apart with her head leaning on the table and wept also two or three weeks after this transaction there was lull in the tempest missourian wag oners came into lawrence often with loads of apples potatoes and flour they met with honest and kindly treatment one sought to take reprisals the many loads of provisions plundered from kansas the bravely patient people still waited redress by law soon there came news of peaceable industrious settler in the neighbourhood of lawrence who had been shot dead by scouting party of missourians in mere sport while he was pursuing his avocations few days after gang of armed ruffians entered the house of citizen in lawrence and carrie d him off under the pretence of arresting him treason on their way they were met by company of young men from lawrence who had been out to inquire about the recent murder they hailed the missourians and they could show legal authority what they had done they took their neighbour into their own ranks to guard him home they offered violence but in answer to the threats of their enemies replied with firmness not to be trifled with w are all armed and we shall take this man though their own horses and cattle had been seized and driven off into missouri drove after drove they inquired of their neighbou r whether the horse he rode belonged to those who had arrested him and when he answered in the affirmative they asked him to dismount and return the animal to his owners truly the forbearance of that persecuted people was wonderful the united 343 344 345 346 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https government where was vested the only power that could legally protect them continued to receive their remonstrances and appeals with fair promises and adroit evasions while its alliance with the slaveholding interest in all its machinations was too thinly veiled to be moment doubted in pursuance of this policy the president appointed governor shan non to rule over the territory man in league with the miss ourians and bent upon carrying out their plans openly it was prudent to somehow or other outrages upon kansas could find redress at his hands the settlers were told to obey the laws and be good children to their father president pierce and they should be protected the laws exclaimed they why these are missouri laws forced upon us at the point of the they were answered the president commands you to obey the laws and if you rebel against his authority you will be declared guilty of treason meanwhile many plotter tried to gain concessions from the friends of freedom talking of the value of the union the danger of civil war and the policy of bending before the storm favourite piece of advice in the mouths of those politicians who set the storm in motion and are guiding it in the hollow of their hands was ever people so hard bested disheartened by sickness plundered of provisions lying down every night with the prospect of murder before morning mocked at by the government of their country their conscientious scruples appealed to to keep the peace where there was peace lured into concessions by fair promises and false professions threatened with traitor s doom if they dared to defend their homes and all this while the free states were looking on with drowsy indifference the whig said with bland they d better obey the powers that be i am friend to law and order the democrat refused to read testimony on the subject and repeated with blind obstinacy i don t believe half the stories and if any of them are true i dare say the are full much to blame the verily they need the trumpet of doom to waken them and the trumpet of doom they will have when wakening comes too late if their slumber lasts much longer that little city of cabins nestling among the lonely hills has called and called in vain redress and protection the murders and robbe ries still go on the border ruffians are assembling their forces at franklin below and at douglass above in their drunken frankness they say they will shoot the men violate the women kill the children and burn the houses that their commission is to drive all the yankee settlers out of the territory by any means and all means and that man will dare to prosecute them whatever they may the settlers all feel that the hour has come stacks of sharpe s rifles stand in the cabins ready loaded forts are erected and thrown up companies of men work at them by turns all day and all night by the light of blazing wood volunteers come in from the neighbouring settlements the wyandott tribe of indians offer their aid in case of need they have been justly treated by the kansas people and are unwilling to have them wiped sentinels guard the doors of the free state hotel all night mounted patrols ride round the settlement the drummer watches at his post ready to beat the alarm they have learned that their cowardly treacherous foes prefer the midnight hour ever and anon random shots come from ruffians conc ealed in dark corners women look anxiously at the doors expecting to see the bleeding bodies of husbands sons or brothers brought in governor robinson now general of the forces still pursues his course of moderation and orders the men not to fire till the very last extremity there was small store of powder and in the vicinity and various plans were devised to bring it in safely through the of missourians i will it said bradford they will never suspect that women carry such another woman in the neighbourhood promptly offered to accompany her and they started in wagon that purpose they were accosted by missouri scouts but their place of destination seemed to imply nothing more than visiting friend they deemed it gallant to let the ladies pass unmolested the kegs of powder were covered by their ample skirts and brought safely into lawrence the young men on guard threw up their caps and cried hurra worthy of the women of 76 alice also was brave in her way she resigned herself patiently to the long and frequent absence of her beloved husband and work seemed too hard her to perform all through the autumn she and the other women of the household had helped to gather the crops tend the cows and feed the horses when it came william s turn to patrol lawrence or to work at the trenches through the night she never asked him to stay with her she only gave him tenderer kiss more lingering pressure of the hand which seemed to say this may be our last 347 348 349 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https one of these occasions he had been absent several days and she sat at her sewing longing longing to hear the sound of his voice the tramp of horse was heard she sprung up and looked from the little window william was not there kissing his hand to her he was wont to she ran out of the door and meeting one of his brothers said in disappoin ted tone i thought william had come he sent word he would come he answered that it was merely one of the horses that had got loose but she went into the house he looked at his wife and said poor alice god grant that it may not be we fear alas it was william s horse that had rushed by so fleetly without rider and with the saddle turned too soon they learned that he had been shot in the back by party of ruffians after he had told them he was unarmed and going home to see his family he supposed that even border ruffians would not be so cowardly to take his life under such circumstances the day passed without any one s being able to muster sufficient courage to tell the mournful tidings to his widow she had long expected it and she met it with dreadful calmness she uttered scream and shed tear she became pallid marble and pressed her hand hard upon her heart she was stupefied and stunned by that overwhelming agony of all the outrages none had produced so much excitement this it was so dastardly to shoot an unarmed man in the back without provocation then bruce was universally beloved his justice and moderation were known unto all men the indians knew how to respect those qualities which they so rarely meet in white men the chiefs of the delawares and the shawnees came to offer their aid and general robinson received them with that personal respect which so peculiarly commends itself to indian dignity the news spread through the territory small bands of volunteers came in from all directions there were five hundred armed men in lawrence every cabin was barrack the free state hotel was crowded with men earnestly discussing what measures should be taken the public safety general robinson pale and anxious moved among them renewing his advice to be patient and forbearing up to this period the citizens of kansas had made aggressions on their merciless foes and had used violence in but it was not easy to restrain them now human nature had been goaded beyond endurance and men were in the mood to or die when he told them governor shannon was coming to inquire into the state of things some shook their heads despondingly while the more fiery spirits cursed governor shannon and contemptuously asked what good could be expected from him out on the prairie troops were being drilled to the tunes of 76 the wyandotts were riding in sitting their noble steeds like centaurs the mettlesome colonel lane was in his element he descanted with untiring volubility on the rights of american citizens and the cruel circumstances attending the death of bruce men clenched their rifles and drew their breath hard while they listened there is mistaking the symptoms the old spirit of lexington and concord is here they had better not trifle with the puritan blood much longer anon they brought in the body of the murdered man his countenance was placid the sleep of childhood the widow asked to see him and tenderly they brought her to that couch of death oh what shriek was there father of mercies it went up to thy throne wilt thou not answer it in view of that suf focating agony the soldiers bowed their heads and wept when governor shannon with his escort came riding across the prairie there was none to invoke blessing on him general robinson went out to receive him and some one suggested that the chief magistrate appointed by the president ought to be received with cheers the door of the room where the murdered body lay was open and men saw it they passed in and out the sobs of the broken hearted widow were heard from the room adjoining his reception was very much like that of richard third who caused the murder of his brother s children john bradford went through formal introduction to governor shannon but katie turned quickly away saying if he had done his duty this would not have the brothers of william bruce turned away also and said coldly we have faith in that the governor saw plainly enough that the blood of kansas was up to fever heat and that it was prudent to cool it down he was very courteous and conciliatory and promised to disperse the bands of ruffians at franklin and elsewhere general robinson with him in these efforts at pacification he addressed the people in speech setting forth mutual mistakes and misre presentations which he trusted time would correct he had always shown himself brave in danger and they knew that he was cautious the good of kansas not his own interest or safety most of them yielded to his arguments and accepted his invitation to supper at the free state hotel in honor of peace restored but some walked away contemptuously saying governor sham 350 351 352 353 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria child https settlers far and near formed procession to escort the body of william bruce to its last resting place alice kept up her strength to witness all the ceremonies and only low stifled sobs came from her breaking heart when the coffin was lowered from her sight but after that she broke down rapidly the pressure of fears and horrors had completely shattered her nervous system she rejected food and seemed never to sleep she appeared to feel more at home with katie than she did with any one else they concluded to establish her in the humble apartment where she had first lived with william pale and silent she had been ever since she lost him but gradually strange fixed expression came over her face if the body was vacated by the soul soon she was utterly helpless and katie fed and tended her if she were an infant the winter proved the indians had predicted cold beyond any within the memory of man the settlers many of them plundered of all their money and most of their clothing suffered cruelly not few of them returned to their homes in ohio pennsylvania and new england indications multiplied that peace would be of short duration poor kate how she had changed thin skeleton with eyes so large and bright but thinking always of others before herself she said mother dear worse troubles are coming upon us than we have ever had john and i have resolved that living or dying we will abide by kansas but had nt you and flora and tom better return to massachusetts the mother looked at her younger children and awaited their answer i have lived through scenes that make men of boys said thomas i will have free home or grave in and you flora inquired the mother the men of kansas have need of nurses the sick and wounded she replied i will stay and help i will abide by my children my brave children said the mother god help us all to our duty alice sat bolstered in her chair by the fire unconscious of the solemn comp act alas said katie how i wish we could convey her safely to her mother but she is too feeble to be emer ging from the terrible winter of 1855 the returning sunshine brought some gleams of hope to the suffering colony they hoped that more emigrants would come in and they knew the fertile soil would yield abundant crops if there were hands to till it but the border ruffians soon dashed the cup of pleasant anticipation from their lips they swore they would stop all yankee emigrants from going into kansas and they renewed their threats to wipe out again they made inroads into the territory robbing the already impoverished settlers and especially seeking to deprive them of arms during one of these forays they seized woman whom they suspected of concealing ammunition and dragged her into the woods where she was subjected to their brutal outrages when kate bradford heard of this her naturally pleasant countenance assume d an expression stern almost to fierceness i called them savages she said when they scalped some of their victims but i did injustice to the savages in their worst cruelties they always respected the modesty of from that time she practiced with rifle and pistol and became expert in using them similar spirit was roused in several of the women who agreed to act under her command if the emer gencies of the time required it circumstances had goaded her to this her nature was kindly ever and she prayed fervently to god that blood might ever rest upon her hands all along she had been sustained by the belief that aid would come to kansas she had such pride in american institutions she could not believe that the government of her country was in league with such abominations and outrages until the return of messenger after messenger sent to washington made the damning proof too strong to be resisted then her old love of new england increased fold all her hopes centred there the pilgrims that came over in the may flower the men and women of 76 had always been the heroes of her imagination and the crisis in which she now found herself living and acting rendered their crown of glory more luminous in her memory massachusetts will help us she was wont to say with somewhat of filial pride in the confident tones of her voice massachusetts will not look on with indifference while her emigrant children are driven into to be slaughtered like sheep by those whom long habits of slaveholding have made familiar with every form of violence and drearily drearily the weeks passed away men and women were limping about with feet that had been frozen during the winter s severest cold many had guns to shoot game to protect them from the wolves or from enemies far worse than wolves their ammunition had been stolen from them provisions were intercepted on the way and every breeze brought rumours that the ruffians 354 355 356 357 the project gutenberg ebook of autumnal leaves by maria

helplessness they had reached the extremest point of desolation still john and katie said massachusetts will help us depend upon it massachusetts will not desert her children in their utmost and other brave hearts responded to the cheering words saying ohio will help connecticut will not get illinois will come to the they had said this to each other at the close of one of their darkest days when lo messenger sent to kansas city letters and papers consigned to friend there was seen riding across the prairie through various perils he had brought the packages safely to lawrenc they were seized and torn open with eager trembling hands crowd of men and women assembled at the office to hear the news bradford was reading aloud to them when his countenance suddenly fell go on go on cried the anxious listeners he gasped out the legislature of texas has voted to give fifty thousand dollars to make kansas slave and massachusetts what has massachusetts done asked kate with nervous eagerness he lowered his eyes one ashamed of his mother while he answered the legislature of massachusetts has voted not to give one dollar to make kansas free in the midst of all the sufferings that had harrowed her soul katie had always remained calm and collected now the first time she groaned aloud and throwing her arms wildly toward heaven she exclaimed in tones of bitter anguish oh massachusetts how i have loved thee how i have trusted in thee then bowing her head in her hands she sobbed out i could not have believed but massachusetts was far off the governor and legislature of her native state did not hear her appeal they were busy with other things that came home to their business not to their bosoms on the 21st of may 1856 lawrence was wiped companies of ruffians encamped around it furious
