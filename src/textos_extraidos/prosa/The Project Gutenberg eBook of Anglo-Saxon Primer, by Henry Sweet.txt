by henry sweet https edition revised oxford at the clarendon press 1905 printed in england at the oxford university press pref ace to first edition the want of an introduction to the study of has long been felt vernon guide was an admirable book its time but has long been completely antiquated i was therefore obliged to make my reader somewhat unsatisfactory compromise between an elementary primer and manual advanced students but i always looked forward to producing strictly elementary book like the present one which would enable to give the larger one more scientiﬁc character and would at the same time serve an introduction to it meanwhile however professor earle has brought out his book the beginner in but this work is quite unsuited to serve an introduction to my reader and will be found to differ so totally in plan and execution from the present one to preclude all idea of rivalry on my part we work on lines which instead of clashing can only diver ge more and more my main principle has been to make the book the easiest possible introduction to the study of poetry has been excluded and selection made from the easiest prose pieces i could ﬁnd original prose is unfortunately limited in extent and the most suitable pieces such the voyages of ohthere and wulfstan are already given in the reader these i could not give over again but i hope the short extracts from the chronicle and the martyrdom of king edmund will be found not wanting in interest the rest of the selections i have had to fall back on scriptural extracts which have the great advantages of simplicity and familiarity of subject the gospel extracts have been transferred here from the reader where they will be omitted in the next edition the sentences which head the selections have been gathered mainly from the gospels ælfric hom ilies and the chronicle they are all of the simplest possible character only those having been taken which would bear isolation from their context they are intended to serve both an introduction and supplement to the longer pieces they are grouped roughly into paragraphs according to the grammatical forms they illustrate thus the ﬁrst paragraph consists mainly of examples of the nominative singular of nouns and adjec tives the second of accusative singulars and so on the spelling has been made rigorously uniform throughout on an early on basis injurious normalizing is to the advanced student it is an absolute necessity the beginner who wants to have the deﬁnite results of scholarship laid before him not the confused and ﬂuctuating spellings which he can not yet interpret intelligently even purely scientiﬁc purposes we require standard of comparison and classiﬁcation in v vi the project gutenberg ebook of primer by henry sweet https arrangement of words in dictionary where we have to decide instance whether to put the original of hear under ē īe ī or the spelling i here adopt is in fact the one i should recommend dictionary purposes from early it is an easy step both to late and to the mercian forms from which modern english is derived that i give ælfric in spelling slightly earlier than his date is more unreasonable than it is classical scholar to print ausonius who doubtless spoke latin with an almo st italian pronunciation in the same spelling virgil it is impossible to go into details but in doubtful or optional cases i have preferred those forms which seemed most instructive to the student thus i have preferred keeping up the distinction between the indic bundon and the subj bunden although the latter is often levelled under the former even in early in the accentuation i have the present retained the conventional quantities which are really quantities i have shown elsewhere phil soc proc 1880 1881 it is use trying to disguise the fact that old english philology owing mainly to its neglect in its native land is still in an unsettled state in the grammar i have cut down the phonology to the narrowest limits giving only what is necessary to enable the beginner to trace the connection of forms within the language itself derivation and syntax have been treated with the same fulness the inﬂections in my opinion to give inﬂections without explaining their use is absurd it would be to teach the names of the different parts of machine without explaining their use and derivation is much fundamental element of language inﬂection the grammar has been based throughout on the texts from which all words and sentences given examples have far possible been taken this i consider absolutely essential in an elementary book what is the use of grammar which gives number of forms and rules which the learner has occasion to apply practically in his reading simply to cut down an ordinary grammar and preﬁx it to selection of elementary texts without any attempt to adapt them to one another is most unjustiﬁable proceeding in the glossary cognate and root words are given only when they occur in the texts or else are easily recognizable by the ordinary english reader all reference to cognate languages has been avoided of course if the beginner knows german the labour of learning old english will be lightened him by one half but he does not require to have the analogies pointed out to him the same applies to the relation between old and modern english to trace the history of the sounds would be quite out of place in this book and postulates knowledge of the intermediate stages which the beginner can not have the notes consist chieﬂy of references to the grammar and are intended mainly those who study without teacher general rule such references are given where the passage itself is quoted in the grammar on the whole i not think the book could be made much easier without defeating its object thus instead of simply referring the student from stęnt to standan and thence to the grammar i might have saved him all this trouble by putting 3 sg pres of standan stand but the result would be in many cases that he would not look at the grammar at most undesirable result although i have given everything that i believe to be necessary every teacher may of course at his own discretion add such further illustrations linguistic historical antiquarian or otherwise he thinks likely to instruct or interest his pupils my thanks are due to professor skeat not only constant advice and encouragement in planning and carrying out this work but also help in correcting the proofs in conclusion i may be allowed to express hope that this little book may prove useful not only to young beginners but also to some of our professors of and examiners in the english language most of whom are now beginning to see the importance of sound elementary knowledge of knowledge which i believe
