to study the penitentiary system returning published book on the subject which was crowned by the french academy from private notes taken in america then wrote his masterpiece democracy in america which secured his election to the academy in 1841 spent some years in public life and then retired in order to travel and write the tyranny of the american majority 1 i hold it to be an impious and execrable maxim that politically speaking the people has right to whatever it pleases and yet i have asserted that all authority originates in the will of the majority am i then in contradiction with myself general law which bears the name of justice has been made and sanctioned not only by majority of this or that people but by majority of mankind the rights of every people are consequently conﬁned within the limits of what is just nation may be considered in the light of jury which is empowered to represent society at large and to apply the great and general law of justic ought such jury which represents society to have more power than the society in which the law it applies originates when i refuse to obey an unjust law i not contest the right which the majority has of commanding but i simply appeal from the sovereignty of the people to the sovereignty of mankind it has been asserted that people can never entirely outstep the boundaries of justice and of reason in those affairs which are more peculiarly its own and that consequently full power may fearlessly be given to the majority by which it is represented but this language is that of slave majority taken collectively may be regarded being whose opinions and most frequently whose interests are opposed to those of another being which is styled minority if it be admitted that man possessing absolute power may misuse that power by wronging his adversaries why shoul d majority not be liable to the same reproach men are not apt to change their charact ers by agglomerating nor does their patience in the presence of obstacles increase with the consciousness of their strength and these reasons i can never willingly invest any number of my fellow creatures with that unlimited authority which i should refuse to any one of them i not think that it is possible to combine several principles in the same government so at the same time to maintain freedom and really to oppose them to one another the form of government which is usually termed mixt has always appeared to to be mere chimera accurately speaking there is such thing mixt government with the meaning usually given to that word because in all communities some one principle of action may be discovered which preponderates over the others england in the last has been more especially cited an example of this form of government in point of fact an essentially aristocratic state altho it comprized very powerful 3 4 5 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https of democracy the laws and customs of the country were such that the aristocracy could not but preponderate in the end and subject the direction of public affairs to its own will the error arose from too much attention being paid to the actual struggle that was going on between the nobles and the people without considering the probable issue of the contest which was really the important point when community actually has mixt is to say when it is equally divided betw een two adverse must either pass through revolution or fall into complete dissolution i am therefore of opinion that some one social power must always be made to predominate over the others but i think that liberty is endangered when this power ﬁnds obstacle which can retard its course and force it to moderate its own vehemence unlimited power is in itself bad and dangerous thing human beings are not competent to exercise it with discretion god only can be omnipotent because his wisdom and his justice are always equal to his power but power on earth is so worthy of honor itself that i would consent to admit its uncontrolled and authority when i see that the right and the means of absolute command or of reverential obedience to the right which it represents are conferred on people or upon king upon an aristocracy or democracy monarchy or republic i recognize the germ of tyranny and i journey onward to land of more hopeful institutions in my opinion the main evil of the present democratic institutions of the united states does not arise is often asserted in europe from their weakness but from their irresistible strength i am not so much alarmed at the excessive liberty which reigns in that country at the very inadequate securities which exist against tyranny when an individual or party is wronged in the united states to whom can he apply redress if to public opinion public opinion constitutes the majority if to the legislature it represents the majority and implicitly obeys its instructions if to the executive power it is appointed by the majority and is passive tool in its hands the public troops consist of the majority under arms the jury is the majority invested with the right of hearing judicial cases and in certain cases even the judges are elected by the majority however iniquitous or absurd the evil of which you complain may be you must submit to it well you can if on the other hand legislative power could be so constituted to represent the majority without necessarily being the slave of its passions an executive so to retain certain degree of uncontrolled authority and judiciary so to remain independent of the other two powers government would be formed which would still be democratic without incurring any risk of tyranny i not say that there is frequent use of tyranny in america at the present day but i maintain that sure barrier is established against it and that the causes which mitigate the government are to be found in the circumstances and the manners of the country more than in its laws footnotes from chapter xv of democracy in america translated by henry reeve alfred musset born in 1810 died in 1857 educated at the college of

clothes were in disorder his cap from which hung beautiful scarlet feather was pulled down over his ears he was walking with long strides toward the banks of the schiavoni and his sword and cloak were dragging behind him while with somewhat disdainful foot he picked his way among the ﬁshermen lying asleep on the ground having arrived at the bridge of paille he stopt and looked around him the moon was setting behind the giudecca and the dawn was gilding the ducal palace from time to time thick smoke or brilliant light could be seen from some neighborin g palace planks stones enormous blocks of marble and debris of every kind obstructed the canal of the prisons recent ﬁre had just destroyed the home of patrician which lined its banks volley of sparks shot up from time to time and by this sinister light an armed soldier could be seen keeping watch in the midst of the ruins our young man however did not seem to be imprest either with this spectacle of destruction or with the beauty of the sky tinged with the rosy colors of the dawning day he looked some time at the horizon if to ease his tired eyes but the brightness of the dawn seemed to produce in him disagreeable effect he wrapt himself in his cloak and pursued his way at run he soon stopt again at the door of palace where he knocked valet holding torch in his hand admitted him immediately he entered he turned round and casting one more glance at the sky exclaimed by bacchus my carnival has cost dear this young man was called pomponio filippo vecellio he was the second son of titian youth full of spirit and imagination who had aroused in his father the most lofty expectations but whose passion cards kept him in continual dissipation it was only four years before that the great painter and his eldest son orazio had died almost at the same time and young pippo in those four years had already dissipated the best part of the immense fortune which the double heritage had given him instead of cultiv ating the talents which he possest by nature and sustaining the glory of his name he passed his days in sleeping and his nights in playin g at the house of certain countess orsini or at least countess who made profession of ruining the gilded youth of venice every night there assembled at her house large company composed of nobles and courtezans there one supped and played and one did not pay one supper it goes without saying that the dice helped to indemnify the mistress of the house meanwhile the sequins and the cyprian wine began to ﬂow freely loving glances were exchanged and the victims drunk with love and wine lost their money and their reason it is from this dangerous resort that we have seen the hero of this story emer ge he had met with more than one loss during the night besides having emptied his pockets at cards the only picture he had ever ﬁnished one that the connoisseurs had pronounced excellent had just been destroyed in ﬁre in the dolﬁno palace it was an historical subject treated with spirit and sureness of touch almost worthy of titian himself sold to rich senator this canvas had met with the same fate great number of other previous works of art the carelessness of valet had turned it to ashes but this pippo counted the least of his misfortunes he was only thinking of the unlucky star that had lately been following him with unusual insistence and of the throws of dice it had made him lose 9 10 11 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https entering his house he began by taking off the coverlet which lay on his table and counting the money left in his drawer then he was of nature naturally gay and optimistic after he had undrest he sat at the window in his night robe seeing that it was almost daylight he began to ponder whether he would close the shutters and get into bed or get up like everybody else it was long time since he had seen the sun in the east and he found the sky more beautiful than ever before deciding whether to wake up or go to sleep he took his chocolate on the balcony in an effort to ﬁght off his drowsiness the moment his eyes closed he would see table many trembling hands and pale faces and would hear again the sound of the cornets what fatal luck he murmured is it possible that one can lose with ﬁfteen and he saw his habitual opponent old vespiano memmo throwing eighteen and taking up the money piled on the table he promptly opened his eyelids to get rid of the bad dream and looked at the young girls passing on the quay he seemed to see in the distance masked woman and was astonished altho it was the time of carni val poor people not go masked and it was strange that at such an hour venetian lady should be out alone on foot he perceived however that what he had taken mask was the face of negress on getting nearer look at her he saw she was not badly formed she walked very quickly and puff of wind which forced her checkered skirt close to her limbs showed her to have graceful ﬁgure pippo leaned over the balcony and saw not without surprize that the negress knocked at his door the porter failed to open it what you want cried the young man is it with that your business lies brunette my name is vecellio and if they are going to keep you waiting i will come and let you in myself the negress lifted her head your name is pomponio vecellio yes or pippo whichever you like you are the son of titian at your service what can i to please you having cast on pippo rapid and curious glance the negress took few steps backward and skilfully threw up into the balcony little box rolled in paper and then promptly ﬂed turning round from time to time pippo picked up the box opened it and found pretty purse wrapt in cotton he rightly suspected that he might ﬁnd under the cotton note that would explain this adventure the note was found indeed but it was mysterious the rest it contained only these words not spend too readily what i enclose herein when you leave home charge with one piece of gold it is enough one day and if in the evening you have any of it left however little it may be you will ﬁnd some poor person who will thank you it the young man examined the box in hundred different ways scrutinized the purse looked once more on to the quay and at length realized that he had learned all he could of truth

was most melancholy all power was concentrated at rome and in the legions the most shameful and degrading scenes were daily enacted the roman aristocracy which had conquered the world and which alone of all the people had any voice in public business under the cæsars had abandoned itself to saturnalia of the most outrageous wickedness the human race ever witnessed cæsar and augustus in establishing the imperial power saw perfectly the necessities of the age the world was so low in its political relation s that other form of government was possible now that rome had conquered numberless provinces the ancient constitution which was based upon the existence of privileged patrician class kind of obstinate and malevolent tories could not continue but augustus had signally neglected every suggestion of true policy by leaving the future to chance destitute of any canon of hereditary succession of any settled rules concerning adoption and of any law regulating election cæsarism was like an enormous load on the deck of vessel without ballast the most terrible shocks were inevitable three times in century under caligula nero and domitian the greatest power that was

gover ned the most disgusting ignominies of the empire such the apotheosis of the emperors and their deiﬁcation during life came from the east and particularly from egypt which was at that period one of the most corrupt countries on the face of the earth however the veritable roman nature still survived and nobility of soul was far from extinct the lofty traditions of pride and virtue which were

more touching fate than that of the young and chaste octavia the daughter of claudius and wife of nero remaining pure in the midst of infamy and slain at years of age without having known single joy the epithets castissimo univiro 6 are not at all rare in the inscriptions some wives accompanied their husbands into exile and others shared their noble deaths the ancient roman simplicity was not lost the children were soberly and carefully brought up the most noble ladies worked with their own hands at woolen fabrics and the excesses of the toilet were almost unknown in the higher families the excellent statesmen who so to speak sprang from the earth under trajan were not improvised they had served in preceding reigns but they had enjoyed but little inﬂuence and had been cast into the

centuries later and strange to say under much more worthy monarchs in its political phase the situation was analogous to that of france which deprived by the revolution of any established rule the succession has yet passed through so many perilous changes without greatly injuring its internal organization or its national strength in its moral aspect the period under consideration may be compared to the eighteenth century an epoch entirely corrupt if we form our judgment from the memoirs manuscripts literature and anecdotes of the time but in which nevertheless some families maintained the greatest austerity of morals philosophy joined hands with the better families of rome and resisted nobly the stoic school produced the lofty characters of cremutius cordus thraseas arria helvidius priscus annæus cornutus and musonius rufus admirable masters of aristocratic virtue the rigidity and exaggeration of this school arose from the horrible cruelty of the cæsars the

liberty kingdoms almost independent existed in palestine syria asia minor lesser armenia and thrace under the protection of rome these kingdom s became factions after caligula only because the profound policy of augustus concerning them was diver ged from in succeeding reigns the numerous free cities were govern ed according to their own laws and had the legislative power and magistracy of autonomic states until the third century their municipal decree commenced with the formula the senate and people the theaters were not simply placed scenic amusement but were foci of opinion and

carnage the beneﬁts conferred by rome upon mankind were the theme of adulator y addresses everywhere to which however it would be unjust to deny some sincerity the doctrine of the peace of rome the idea of vast democracy organized under roman protection lay at the bottom of all political speculations greek rhetorician displays vast erudition in proving that rom an glory should be claimed by all the branches of the hellenic race common patrimony in regard to syria asia minor and egypt we may say that the roman conquest did not destroy any of their liberties those nations had either been already long dead to political life or had never enjoyed it finally in spite of the extortions of governors and of the violence which is inseparable from despotic sway the world had in many respects never been so well off an administration coming from remote center was so great an advantage that even the rapacious prætors of the latter days of the republic had failed to render it unpop ular the julian law had also narrowed down the scope of abuses and peculations the follies or cruelties of the emperor except under nero reached only the roman aristocracy and the immediate followers of the prince never had men who did not care to busy themselves about politics been able to live more at ease the ancient republics in which every one was compelled to take part in the factions were very uncomfortable places of residence there was continually going on some disor ganization or proscription but under the empire the time seemed made expressly great proselytism which should overrule both the quarrels of neighborhoods and the rivalry of dynasties attacks on liberty were much more frequently owing to the remnants of the provincial or communal authority than to the roman administration of this truth we have had and shall have many occasions to take note those of the conquered countries where political privileges had been unknown ages and which lost nothing but the right of destroying themselves by continual wars the empire was such an of prosperity and they had never before experienced and we may add without being paradoxical that it was also them an of liberty on the one hand freedom of commerce and industry of which the grecian state had conception became possible on the other hand the new régime could not but be favorable to freedom of thought this freedom is always greater under monarchy than under the rule of jealous and citizens and it was unknown in the ancient republics the greeks accomplished great things without it thanks to the incomparable force of their genius but we must not forget that athens had complete inquisition there was indeed under the empire more than one arbitrary decree against the philosophers but it was always called forth by their entering into political schemes we may search in vain the roman law before constantine single passage against freedom of thought and the history of the imperial government furnishes instance of

satire who is he and what is the value of this literature of which he is one of the princes at bottom like every literature it is deﬁn ition of man and to judge it we must compare it with man we can

got up every morning at the same time looked out of the window at the weather and then went and sat before the ﬁre in the hall here she would think of the happy years of paul childhood when he had worked in the kneeling side by side in the soft ground with aunt lison the two women rivals in their effort to amuse the child and seeing who could root up the young plants most skilfully so musing

again at last she could not write it any more she would muddle everything other words and exhaust herself almost to idiocy ever since her childhood just one habit had clung to of jumping up out of bed the moment she had drunk her morning coffee she was inordinately fond of that way of breakfasting and the privation would have been felt more than anything else each morning she would await rosalie arriv al with extraordinary impatience and soon the cup was put upon the table at her side she would sit up and empty it almost greedily and then throwing of f her robe she would begin to dress herself at once she thought she was directly pursued by obstinate misfortune against which she became fatalistic an oriental the habit of seeing her dreams fade away and destroy her hopes made her afraid to undertake anything and she waited whole days to accomplish the most simple affair convinced that she would always take the wrong way to it and that it would turn out badly she repeated continually i have never had any luck in my life then rosalie would cry supposin g you had had to work your were obliged to get up every morning at six and prepare your day doing s there are lots of people who are obliged to that and when such people become too old they die of poverty she had checked certain memorable days in her life and now and then she was able to remember episodes of an entire month bringing them up one by one grouping them together and connecting together all those little matters which had preceded or followed some important event she succeeded by sheer force of attention by force of memory and of concentrated will power in bringing back to mind almost completely her two ﬁrst years at peuples distant memories of her life came back to her with singular facility bringing kind of relief but the later years seemed to lose themselves in become mixt one with another and sometimes she would stay an indeﬁnite time her head bowed on one of the calendars her mind full of the past and yet not being able to remember whether it was in this or that calendar that such or such remembrance ought to be tabulated she placed them around the room like the pictures of the way of the tableaux of days that were more then she would abruptly set down her chair before one of them and there she would sit until night came staring at it immobile buried in her dreams of remembrance one morning rosalie came earlier than usual into her room and said setting down upon the table the bowl of coffee come now drink this up quickly denis is waiting us at the door we are going over to peuples i got some business over there jeanne thought that she was going to faint so deep was her emotion she drest herself frightened and tremulous at the mere idea of seeing again that dear house radiant sky spread out above over all the world and the horse in ﬁts and starts of liveliness sometimes broke into gallop when they entered into the commune of etouvent jeanne heart beat so fast that she could hardly breathe and when she saw from distance the brick pillars of the of her old home she exclaimed in low voice two or three times oh if something had happened to change her whole heart they left the wagon with the couillards then while rosalie and her son went off to attend to their business the caretakers offered to take jeanne over the château the present owners of it being away so they gave her the keys she set out alone and when she was fairly before the old manor by the seaside she stopt to look at it once again it had changed in nothing outside the large grayish building that day showed upon its old walls the smile of the brilliant sunshine all the shutters were closed bit of dead branch fell on her dress she raised her eyes it came from the she drew

seen set in place on the very day that julien had made his ﬁrst visit she reached the double doors of the vestibule of the house and she had great trouble to open them the heavy rusty key refused to turn in the lock at length the lock yielded with heavy grinding of its springs and the door little obstinate itself burst open with cloud of dust at once and almost running she went upstairs to her own room she could recognize it hung it was with light new paper but throwing open window she looked out and stood motionless stirred even to the depth of her being at the sight of all that landscape so much beloved the shrubs the the ﬂat reaches and the sea dotted with brown sails motionless in the distance then she began prowling about the great empty dwelling she even stopt to look at the discolorations on the walls spots familiar to her eyes once she stood before little hole crusht in the plaster by the baron who had often amused himself when he was young with making passages at arms cane in hand against the partition wall when he happened to be passing this spot she went to the it was somber behind the closed shutters some time she could not distinguish anything then her eyes became accustom ed to the darkness little by little she recognized the wide tapestries with their patterns of birds ﬂitting about two settees were set before the chimney if people had just quitted them and the very odor of the room an odor which it had always old vague sweet odor belonging to some old entered jeanne very being enwrapt her in souvenirs intoxicated her memory she remained gasping breathing in that breath of the past her eyes ﬁxt upon those two chairs suddenly she she had so often seen father and her mother sitting there warming their feet by the ﬁre she started back terriﬁed struck her back against the edge of the door caught at it to keep herself from falling but kept her eyes still ﬁxt upon the chairs the vision disappeared some moments she remained forgetful of everything then slowly she recovered her and would have ﬂed from the room fearful of losing her her glance fell by chance on the on which she was leaning and there before her eyes were the marks that had been made to keep track of poulet height he was growing up the little marks climbed the painted wood at irregular intervals ﬁgures traced with the penknife noted down the different ages with the month of the boy life some times the jottings were in the handwriting of the baron large hand sometimes they were in her own smaller hand sometimes in that of aunt lison little shaky it seemed to her that the child of other days was actually there before her with his blond hair pressing his little forehead against the wall so that his height could be measured the baron was crying jeanne he has grown whole centimeter in the last six weeks she began to kiss the piece of wood in frenzy of love but some one was calling her from outside it was rosalie voice madame jeanne madame jeanne we are waiting you to have luncheon she went out in trance she hardly understood anything that the other said to her she ate the things that they put on her plate she listened without knowing what she heard talking mechanically with the women who inquired about her health she let them embrace her and herself kissed the cheeks of fered to her and then got into the wagon again when she caught her last glimpse of the high roof of the château across the trees she felt terrible sinking in her heart it seemed to her in her innermost being that she had said farewell forever to her old home 73 74 75 the

compared painting and poetry with one another was man of reﬁned feeling who became aware of similar effect produced upon himself by both arts he felt both represent what is absent if it were present and appearanc if it were reality that both deceived and that the deception of both is pleasing second observer sought to penetrate below the surface of this pleasure and discovered that in both it ﬂowed from the same source beauty the idea of which we ﬁrst deduce from bodily objects possesses universal laws applicable to more things than one to actions and to thoughts well to forms third reﬂected upon the value and distribution of these universal laws and noticed that some are more predominant in painting others in poetry that thus in the latter case poetry will help to explain and illustrate painting in the former painting will the same poetry the ﬁrst was the amateur the second the philosopher the third the critic the ﬁrst two could not easily make wrong use of either their feelings or conclusions on the other hand the value of the critic observations mainly depends upon the correctness of their application to the individual case and since one clear critic there have always been ﬁfty ingenious ones it would have been wonder if this application had always been applied with all that caution which is required to hold the balance equally between the two arts if apelles and protogenes in their lost writings on painting afﬁrmed and illustrated its laws by the previously established rules of poetry we may feel sure that they did it with that moderation and accuracy with which we now see in the works of aristotl cicero horace and quintilian the principles and experience of painting applied to eloquence and poetry it is the privilege of the ancients never in any matter to too much or too little but in many points we moderns have imagined that we have advanced far beyond them because we have changed their narrow lanes into highways even tho the shorter and safer highways contract into footpaths they lead through deserts the dazzling antithesis of the greek voltaire painting is dumb poetry and poetry is speaking painting can never have been found in any didactic work it was an idea amongst others of simonides and the truth it contains is so evident that we feel compelled to overlook the indistinctness and error which accompany it 86 87 88 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https yet the ancients did not overlook them they conﬁned the expression of simonides to the effect of either art but at the same time forgot not to inculcate that notwithstanding the complete similarity of this effect the two were different both in the objects which they imitated and in their mode of imitation but just tho such difference existed many recent critics have drawn from this harmony of poetry and painting the most conclusions at one time they compress poetry into the narrower limits of painting at another they allow painting to occupy the whole wide sphere of poetry everything say they that the one is entitled to should be conceded to the other everything that pleases or displeases in the one is necessarily pleasing or displeasing in the other full of this idea they give utterance in the most conﬁdent tone to the most shallow decisions when criticizing the works of poet and painter upon the same subject they set down faults any diver gences they may observe laying the blame upon the one or the other accordingly they may have more taste poetry or painting indeed this false criticism has misled in some degree the professors of art it has produced the love of description in poetry and of allegory in painting while the critics strove to reduce poetry to speaking painting without properly knowing what it could and ought to paint and painting to dumb poem without having considered in what degree it could express general ideas without alienating itself from its destiny and degenerating into an arbitrary method of writing footnotes from the preface to the laocoön translated by beasley and helen zimmern an earlier translation of the laocoön was made by william ross in ii of suffering held in restraint 15 herr winckelmann has pronounced noble simplicity and quiet grandeur displayed in the posture less than in the expression to be the characteristic features common to all the greek masterpieces of painting and sculpture says he the depths of the sea always remain calm however much the surface may be raging so the expression in the ﬁgures of the greeks under every form of passion shows great and soul this spirit is portrayed in the countenance of laocoön and not in the countenance alone under the most violent suffering the pain discovers itself in every muscle and sinew of his body and the beholder while looking at the agonized contraction of the abdomen without viewing the face and the other parts believes that he almost feels the pain himself this pain expresses itself however without any violence both in the features and in the whole posture he raises terrible shriek such virgil makes his laocoön utter the opening of the mouth does not admit it it is rather an anxious and supprest sigh described by sadoleto the pain of body and grandeur of soul are it were weighed out and distributed with equal strength through the whole frame of the ﬁgure laocoön suffers but he suffers the philoctetes of sophocles his misery pierces us to the very soul but inspires us with wish that we could endure misery like that great man the expressing of so great soul is far higher than the painting of beautiful nature the artist must have felt within himself that strength of spirit which he imprinted upon his marble greece had philosophers and artists in one person and more than one 89 14 90 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https philosophy gave her hand to art and breathed into its ﬁgures more than ordinary souls the observation on which the foregoing remarks are founded that the pain in the face of laocoön does not show itself with that force which its intensity would have led us to expect is perfectly correct moreover it is indisputable that it is in this very point where the would have decided that the artist had fallen short of nature and had not reached the true pathos of pain that his wisdom is particularly conspicuous but i confess i differ from winckelmann to what is in his opinion the basis of this wisdom and to the universality of the rule which he deduces from it i acknowledge that i was startled ﬁrst by the glance of disapproval which he casts upon virgil and secondly by the comparison with philoctetes from this point then i shall set out and write down my thoughts they were developed in laocoön suffers sophocles philoctetes but how does the latter suffer it is curious that his sufferings should leave such different impression behind them the cries the shrieking the wild imprecations with which he ﬁlled the camp and interrupt ed all the sacriﬁces and holy rites resound less horribly through his desert island and were the cause of his being banished to it the same sounds of despondency sorrow and despair ﬁll the theater in the poet imitation it has been observed that the third act of this piece is shorter than the others from this it may be gathered say the critics that the ancients took little pains to preserve uniformity of length in the different acts i quite agree with them but i should rather ground my opinion upon another example than this the sorrowful exclamations and the moanings of which this act consists must have been pronounced with tensions and breakings off altogether different from those required in continuous speech and doubtless made this act last quite long in the representation the others it appears much shorter to the reader when seen on paper than it must have done to the audience in theater cry is the natural expression of bodil y pain homer wounded heroes frequently fall with cries to the ground he makes venus when merely scratched shriek aloud not that he may thereby paint the effeminacy of the goddess of pleasure but rather that he may give suffering nature her due even the iron mars when he feels the lance of diomedes shrieks so horribly that his cries are like those of ten thousand furious warriors and ﬁll both armies with horror tho homer in other respects raises his heroes above human nature they always remain faithful to it in matters connected with the feeling of pain and insult or its expression through cries tears or reproaches in their actions they are beings of higher order in their feelings true men i know that we more reﬁned europeans of wiser and later age know how to keep our mouths and eyes under closer restraint we are forbidden by courtesy and propriety to cry and weep and with us the active brave ry of the ﬁrst rough age of the world has been changed into passive yet even our own ancestors tho barbarians were greater in the latter than in the former to suppress all pain to meet the stroke of death with unﬂinching eye to die laughing under the bites of adders to lament neither their sins nor the loss of their dearest were the characteristics of the old heroic courage of the north palnatoki forbade his jomsbur gers either to fear or so much to mention the name of fear not so the greek he felt and feared he gave utterance to his pain and sorrow he was ashamed of human weaknesses only none of them must hold him back from the path of honor or impede him in the fulﬁlment of his duty what in the barbarian sprang from habit and ferocity arose from principle in the greek with him heroism was the spark concealed in ﬂint which so long external force awakens it sleeps in quiet nor robs the stone either of its clearness or its coldness with the barbarian it was bright consuming ﬂame which was ever roaring and devoured or at least blackened every other good quality thus when homer makes the trojans march to the combat with wild cries the greeks on the contrary in resolute silence the critics justly observe that the 91 92 93 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https intended to depict the one barbarians the other civilized people i wonder that they have not remarked similar contrast of character in another passage the hostile armies have made truce they are busied with burning their dead and these rites are accompanied on both sides with the warm ﬂow of tears but priam forbids the trojans to weep he forbade them to weep says dacier because he feared the effect would be too softening and that on the morrow they would go with less courage to the battle true but why i ask should priam only fear this result why does not agamemnon also lay the same prohibition on the greeks the poet has deeper meaning he wishes to teach us that the civilized greek could be brave at the same time that he wept while in the uncivilized trojan all human feelings were to be previously stiﬂed it is worth observing that among the few tragedies which have come down to us from antiquity two are found in which bodily pain constitutes not the lightest part of the misfortune which befalls the suffering philoctetes and the dying hercules sophocles paints the last also moaning and shrieking weeping and crying thanks to our polite neighbors those masters of propriety such ridiculous and intolerable characters moaning philoctetes or shrieking hercules will ever again appear upon the stage one of their latest poets has indeed ventured upon philoctetes but would he have dared to exhibit the true one even laocoön is found among the lost plays of sophocles would that fate had spared it to us the slight mention which some old grammarians have made of it affords us ground concluding how the poet had handled his subject but of this i feel certain that laocoön would not have been drawn more stoically than philoctetes and hercules all stoicism is undramatical and our sympathy is always proportioned to the suffering exprest by the object which interests us it is true if we see him bear his misery with great soul this grandeur of soul excites our admiration but admiration is only cold emotion and its inactive astonishment excludes every warmer passion well every distinct idea i now come to my inference if it be true that cry at the sensation of bodily pain particularly according to the old greek way of thinking is quite compatible with greatness of soul it can not have been the sake of expressing such greatness that the artist avoided imitating this shriek in marble another reason therefore must be found his here deviating from his rival the poet who

weather was favorable and everybody was in motion i with several of my relations and friends had been provided with good place in one of the upper stories of the römer itself where we might completely survey the whole we betook ourselves to the spot very early in the morning and from above in view contemplated the arrangeme nts which we had inspected more closely the day before there was the fountain with two large tubs on the left and right into which the on the post was to pour from its two beaks white wine on this side and red wine on that there gathered into heap lay the oats here stood the large wooden hut in which we had several days since seen the whole fat ox roasted and basted on huge spit before charcoal ﬁre all the avenues leading out from the römer and from other streets back to the röm er were secured on both sides by barriers and guards the great square was gradually ﬁlled and the waving and pressure grew every moment stronger and more in motion the multitude always if possible endeavored to reach the spot where some new scene arose and something particular was announced all this time there reigned tolerable stillness and when the were sounded all the people seemed struck with terror and amazement what ﬁrst attracted the attention of all who could overlook the square from above was the train in which the lords of aix and nurember g brought the to the cathedral these palladia had been assigned the ﬁrst place in the carriage and the deputies sat before them on the back seat with becoming reverence now the three electors betake themselves

pappenheim instantly mounts his horse he was very handsome slender gentleman whom the spanish costume the rich doublet the gold mantle the high feathered hat and the loose ﬂying hair became very well he puts himself in motion and amid the sound of all the bells the ambassadors follow him on horseback to the quarters of the emperor in still great er magniﬁcence than on the day of electio one would have liked to be there too indeed on this day it would have been altogether desirable to multiply one self howev er we told each other what was going on there now the emperor is putting on his domestic robes we said new dress and after the old carolingian pattern the hereditary ofﬁcers receive the insignia and with them get on horseback the emperor in his robes the roman king in the spanish habit immediately mount their steeds and while this is done the endless procession which precedes them has already announced them the eye was already wearied by the multitude of attendants and magistrates and by the nobility who in stately fashion were moving along but when the electoral envoys the hereditary ofﬁcers and at last under the cano py borne by twelve schöf fen and senators the emperor in romantic costume and to the left little behind him in the spanish dress his son slowly ﬂoated along on magniﬁcently adorned horses the eye was more sufﬁcient the sight one would have liked to detain the scene but moment by magic charm but the glory passed on without stopping and the space that was scarcely quitted was immediately ﬁlled again by the crowd which poured in like billows but now new pressure took place another approach from the market to the römer gate had to be opened and road of planks to be bridged over it on which the train returning from the cathedral was to walk

else to be present in the church the rest of us in the interim partook of frugal repast in this festal day we had to be contented with cold meat but on the other hand the best and oldest wine had been brought out of all the so that in this respect at least we celebrated the ancient festival in ancient style in the square the sight most worth seeing was now the bridge which had been ﬁnished and covered with orange and white cloth and we who had stared at the emperor ﬁrst in his carriage and then on horseback were now to admire him walking on foot singularly enough the last pleased us the most we thought that in this way he exhibited himself both in the most natural and in the most digniﬁed manner older persons who were present at the coronation of francis the first related that maria theresa beautiful beyond measure had looked on this solemnity from balcony window of the frauenstein house close to the römer her consort returned from the cathedral in his strange costume and seemed to her so to speak like ghost of charlemagne he had if in jest raised both his hands and shown her the imperial globe the scepter and the curious gloves at which she had broken out into immoderate laughter which served the great delight and ediﬁcation of the crowd which was thus honored with sight of the good and natural matrimonial understanding between the most exalted couple of christendom but when the empress to greet her consort waved her handkerchief and even shouted loud vivat to him the enthusiasm and exultation of the people was raised to the highest so that there was end to the cheers of joy 101 102 103 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https rejoicings which resounded from the now spread likewise over the great

at other times to be touched this was done to prevent the mischief inevitable with such rush of persons but in order to sacriﬁce in some degree to the genius of the mob persons expressly appointed went behind the procession loosened the cloth from the bridge wound it up like ﬂag and threw it into the air this gave rise to disaster but to laughable mishap the cloth unrolled itself in the air and it fell covered larger or smaller number of persons those now who took hold of the ends and drew them toward themselves pulled all those in the middle to the ground enveloped them and teased them till they tore or cut themselves through and everybody in his own way had borne off corner of the stuff made sacred by the footsteps of majesty it was precisely at the right time that i again took possession of my window the most remarkable part of all that was to be seen in public was just about to take place all the people had turned toward the römer and reiterated shout of vivat gave us to understand that the emperor and king in their vestments were showing themselves to the populace from the balcony of the great hall but they were not alone to serve spectacle since another strange spectacle occurred before their eyes first of all the handsome slender hereditary marshal ﬂung himself upon his steed he had laid aside his sword in his right hand he held silver vessel and tin spatula in his left he rode within the barriers to the great heap of oats sprang in ﬁlled the vessel to overﬂow smoothed it off and carried it back again with great dignity the imperial stable was now provided the hereditary chamberlain then rode likewise to the spot and brought back basin with ewer and towel but more entertaining the spectators was the hereditary carver who came to fetch piece of the roasted ox he also rode with silver dish through the barriers to the large wooden kitchen and came forth again with his portion covered that he might go back to the römer now it was the turn of the hereditary cupbearer who rode to the fountain and fetched wine thus now was the imperial table furnished and every eye waited upon the hereditary treasurer who was to throw about the money everybody knew now that the emperor and king would return from the cabinet whither they had retired from the balcony and feast in the great hall of the römer we had been able to admire the arrangements made it the day before and my most anxious wish was if possible to look in i repaired therefore by the usual path to the great staircase which stands directly opposite the door of the hall here i gazed at the distinguished personages who this day acted the servants of the head of the empire counts all splendidly drest passed carrying the dishes from the kitchen so that the contrast between their dignity and their occupation might well be bewildering to boy the crowd was not great but considering the little space sufﬁciently perceptible the was guarded while those who were authorized went frequently in and out i saw one of the palatine domestic ofﬁcials whom i asked whether he could not take in with him he did not deliberate long but gave one of the silver vessels he just then he could so much the more i was neatly clad and thus i reached the sanctuary the palatine buffet stood to the left directly by the door and with some steps i placed myself on the elevation of it behind the barriers at the other end of the hall immediately by the windows raised on the steps of the throne and under canopies sat the emperor and king in their robes but the crown and scepter lay some distance behind them on gold cushions the three spiritual electors their buffets behind them had taken their places on single elevations the elector of mentz opposite their majesties the

with tragic dignity let man venture to lay hand on shakespeare works thinking to improve anything essential he will be sure to punish himself the bad is radically odious and to endeavor in any manner to ennoble it is to violate the laws of propriety hence in my opinion dante and even tasso have been much more successful in their portraiture of demons than milton whether the age of shakespeare

without having foundation in human nature on this the poet builds he calls up from their hidde n abysses that dread of the unknown and presage of dark side of nature and world of spirits which philosophy now imagines it has altogether exploded in this manner he is in some degree both the portrayer and the philosopher of superstition that is not the philosopher who denies and turns it into ridicule but what is still more difﬁcult who distinctly exhibits its origin in apparently irrationa l and yet natural opinions but when he ventures to make arbitrary changes in these popular traditions he altogether forfeits his right to them and merely holds up his idle fancies to our ridicule shakespeare picture of the witches is truly magical in the short scenes where they enter he has created them peculiar language which altho composed of the usual elements still seems to be collection of formulæ of incantation the sound of the words the accumulation of rimes and the rhythm of the

wise those who desire that hell should sincerely and honestly give good advice these repulsive things from which the imagination shrinks are here emblems of the hostile powers which operate in nature and the repugnance of our senses is outweighed by the mental horror with one another the witches discourse like women of the very lowest class this was the class to which witches were ordinarily supposed to belong when however they address macbeth they assume loftier tone their predictions which they either themselves pronounce or allow their apparitions to deliver have all the obscur brevity the majestic solemnity of oracles we here see that the witches are merel y instruments they are governed by an invisible spirit or the operation of such great and dreadful events would be above their

the perpetrator must have been portrayed hardened villain shakesp eare wished to exhibit more sublime an ambitious but noble hero yielding to hellish temptation and in whom all the crimes to which in order to secure the fruits of his ﬁrst crime he is impelled by necessity can not altogether eradicate the stamp of native heroism he has therefore given threefold division to the guilt of that crime

civilization of mankind are connected with the ideas of races community of language and adherence to one original direction of the intellectual and moral faculties long attention was directed solely to the extremes in varieties of color and of form and to the vividness of the ﬁrst impression of the senses the observer was naturally disposed to regard races rather originally different species than

recent times by the rapid progress of geographical the analogies presented by the varieties in the species of many wild and domesticated the more correct observations collected regarding the limits of fecundi ty in hybrids the greater number of the contrasts which were formerly supposed to exist have disappeared before the laborious researches of tiedemann on the brain of negroes and of europeans

the races inhabiting the islan ds of the south indian and west australian archipelago and with the papuas and alfourous haroforas endamenes we see that black skin woolly hair and cast of countenance

families which are capable of the greatest distribution over the surface of the earth the different races of mankind are forms of one sole species by the union of two of whose members descendants are propagated they are not different species of genus since in that case their hybrid descendants would remain unfruitful but whether the human races have descended from several primitive races of men or from one alone is question that can not be determined from experience geographical investigations regarding the ancient seat the cradle of the human race are not devoid of mythical character we not know says wilhelm von humboldt in an unpublished work on the varieties of languages and nations either from history or from authentic tradition any period of time in which the human race has not been divided into social groups whether the gregarious condition was original or of subsequent occurrence we have historic evidence to show the separate mythical relations found to exist independently of one another in different parts of the earth appear to refute the ﬁrst hypothesis and concur in ascribing the generation of the whole human race to the union of one pair the general prevalence of this myth has caused it to be regarded traditionary record transmitted from primitive man to his descendants but this very circumstance seems rather to prove that it has historical foundation but has simply arisen from an identity in the mode of intellectual conception which has everywhere led man to adopt the same conclusion regarding identical phenomena in the same manner many myths have doubtless arisen not from any historical connection existing between them but rather from an identity in human thought and imagination another evidence in favor of the purely mythical nature of this belief is afforded by the fact that the ﬁrst origin of phenomenon which is wholly beyond the sphere of explained in perfect conformity with existing views being considered on the principle of the colonization of some desert island or remote mountainous valley at 132 133 134 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https period when mankind had already existed thousands of years it is in vain that we direct our thoughts to the solution of the great problem of the ﬁrst origin since man is too intimately associated with his own race and with the relations of time to conceive of the existence of an individual independently of preceding generation and age solution of those difﬁcult questions which can not be determined by inductive reasoning or by the belief in this presumed traditional condition be actually based on historical evidence or whether mank ind inhabited the earth in gregarious associations from the origin of the not

commonly designated by the somewhat indeﬁnite term races in the vegetable kingdom and in the natural history of birds and ﬁshes classiﬁcation into many small families is based on surer foundation than where large sections are separated into few but large divisions so it also appears to that in the determination of races preference should be given to the establishment of small families of nations whether we adopt the old classiﬁcation of my master blumenbach and admit ﬁve races the caucasian mongolian american ethiopian and malayan or that of prichard into seven races the iranian turanian american hottentots and bushmen negroes papuas and alfourous we fail to recognize any typical sharpness of deﬁnition or any general or principle in the division of these groups the extremes of form and color are certainly separated but without regard to the races which can not be included in any of these classes and which have been alternately termed scythian and allophyllic iranian is certainly less objectionable term the european nations than caucasian but it may be maintained generally that geographical denominations are very vague when used to express the points of departure of races more

creations of man and closely interwoven with the development of mind are independently of the national form which they exhibit of the greatest importance in the recognition of similarities or differences in races this importance is especially owing to the clue which community of descent affords in treading that mysterious labyrinth in which the connection of physical powers and intellectual forces manifests itself in thousand different forms the brilliant progress made within the last in germany in philosophical philology has greatly facilitated our investigations into the national character of languages and the inﬂuence exercised by descent but here in all domains of ideal speculation the dangers of deception are closely linked to the rich and certain proﬁt to be

more properly churches with lead the ceilings of the halls are of the same precious metal many of the apartments have small tables of pure gold of considerable thickness and the windows have also golden ornaments so vast indeed are the riches of the palace that it is impossible to convey an idea of them in this island there are pearls also in large quantities of red pink color round in shape and of great size equal in value to or even exceeding that of the white pearls it is customary with one part of the inhabitants to bury their dead and with another part to burn them the former have practise of putting one of these pearls into the mouth of the corpse there are also found there number of precious stones of so great celebrity was the wealth of this island that desire was excited in the breast of the grand khan kublai now reigning to make the conquest of it and to annex it to his dominions in order to effect this he ﬁtted out numerous ﬂeet and embarked large body of troops under the command of two of his principal ofﬁcers one of whom was named abbacatan and the other vonsancin the expedition sailed from the ports of tun and probably amoy and ningpo and crossing the intermediate sea reached the island in safety but in consequence of jealousy that arose between the two commanders one of whom treated the plans of the other with contempt and resisted the execution of his orders they were unable to gain possession of any city or fortiﬁed place with the exception of one only which was carried by assault the garrison having refused to surrender directions were given putting the whole to the sword and in obedience thereto the heads of all were cut off excepting of eight persons who by the efﬁcacy of diabolical charm consisting of jewel or amulet introduced

presently died it happened after some time that north wind began to blow with great force and the ships of the tatars which lay near the shore of the island were driven foul of each other it was determined therefore in council of the ofﬁcers on board that they ought to disengage themselves from the land and accordingly soon the troops were reembarked they stood out to sea the gale however increased to so violent degree that number of the vessels foundered the people belonging to them by ﬂoating on pieces of the wreck saved themselves upon an island lying about four miles from the coast of zipangu the other ships which not being so near to the land did not suffer from the storm and in which the two chiefs were embarked together with the principal ofﬁcers or those whose rank entitled them to command hundred thousan d or ten thousand men directed their course homeward and returned to the grand khan those of the tatars who remained upon the island where they were wrecked and who amounted to about thirty thousand men ﬁnding themselves left without shipping abandoned by their leaders and having neither arms nor provisions expected nothing less than to become captives or to perish especially the island afforded habitations where they could take shelter and refresh themselves soon the gale ceased and the sea became smooth and calm the people from the main island of zipangu came over with large force in numerous boats in order to make prisoners of these shipwrecked tatars and having landed proceeded in search of them but in straggling disorderly manner the tatars on their part acted with prudent circumspection and being concealed from view by some high land in the center of the island while the enemy were hurrying in pursuit of them by one road made circuit of

classics volume viii of 10 continental https confuted the errors of others in so far they related to riches thems elves we have to confute those on the subject of time cause of nobility in that part where it is deﬁned ancient riches and this is done in the part that begins nor will they admit that man lowly born noble can become and in the ﬁrst place this is refuted by an argument taken from the very people who are so mistaken then to put them to greater confusion this their argument is destroyed and this is done where it says and thus it comes from what i have said before finally it sums error being evident and it being therefore time to learn the this it does where it says because to the healthy mind etc i say then nor will they admit that man lowly born noble can become here we must observe that it is the opinion of these mistaken ones that man originally peasant can never be called nobleman and man who is the son of peasant can likewise never be called noble and here they contradict their own statement when they say that time is required nobility by putting in this word ancient riches because it is impossible by process of time to arrive at the generation of nobility by the reason of theirs here given which denies that man of low birth can become noble by anything he may or by any accident and denies the possibility of change from father to noble son if the son of peasant be still peasant his son also will be peasant and thus we can never ﬁnd point at which nobility can begin by process of time and if our opponent wishing to defend himself shall say that nobility begins at the moment when the low estate of our ancestors is forgotten i answer that this tells against himself because there must necessarily be change here from the low estate to the noble from one man to another from father to son which is contrary to what they assert and if our opponent defends himself pertinaciously saying that he maintain s that the change may take place when the low estate of one ancestors has fallen into oblivion then altho the text takes notice of this it is ﬁtting that the commentary should reply to it and therefore i answer thus that from what they say four great difﬁculties would follow so that theirs can not be good reason the ﬁrst is that the better human nature might be the more difﬁcult and the more tardy would be the generation of nobility which is great difﬁculty since the better thing is the more it is honored and the more good it causes and nobility would be commemorated among the good things and that this would be so is proved if rank or rather nobility which is understood to be the same thing is generated by oblivion then the sooner men are forgotten the quicker is their nobility generated so much the sooner would nobility come all therefore the sooner men were forgotten the sooner they would be ennobled and on the contrary the better the memory of them the more tardy would be their nobility the second difﬁculty is that in case except man could such distinction be made that is between noble and vile which is great difﬁculty in every kind of thing we see an appearance of nobility or of vileness whence we often call one horse noble and one vile or one falcon noble and one vile or one pearl noble and one vile and that this distinction could not be made is proved thus if the forgetting of ignoble ancestors is cause of nobility where the ancestors never were ignoble there could be oblivion since oblivion is the destruction of memory and in the said animals and plants and minerals degrees of higher and lower are not noted because they spring from one nature and are of equal condition and in their generation there can be nothing of nobility or the reverse seeing that both extremes must be regarded possession or privation possible to the same subject and therefore in them such distinction can exist and if our opponent were to say that in other things nobility is understood to be the goodness therefore but in man is understood the forgetfulness of his low estate one would like to answer not with words but with the knife to such stupidity would give goodness to the cause of nobility in other things but in man getfulness its origin 153 154 155 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https third difﬁculty is that those generated would often come before the generation which is quite impossible and this may be demonstrated thus let us suppose that gherardo cammino was grandson of the lowest peasant that ever drank of sile or cagnano and that his grandfather were not yet buried in oblivion who would dare to say that gherardo cammino was not noble and who would not agree with in saying that he was noble certainly none however presumptuous they may wish to be because he was noble and such will his memory ever be and if his ignoble ancestors had not been utterly forgotte n our opponent asserts and he had become noble and his nobility were evident we see it to be then it would have existed in him before its generation had existed and this is perfectly impossible the fourth difﬁculty is that such man this supposed ancestor would be considered noble being dead who was not noble when living and more impossible thing there could not be may be demonstrated thus let us suppose that in the age of dardanus there remained memory of his ancestors and let us suppose that in the age of laomedon this memory had died out and oblivion taken its place according to our opponent opinion laomedon was noble and dardanus ignoble during life should we to whom the memory of their ancestors i mean beyond dardanus has not come down should we say that dardanus while alive was common peasant and dead became noble and this is not contradicted by the story that he was the son of jupiter this is fable of which in philosophical discussion we should take heed and yet if our opponent should wish to fall back on the fable certainly that which is covered by the fable would upset all his ar guments and thus it is manifest that the argument of which who would make oblivion the cause of nobility is false and erroneous footnotes from book iv

appears to have been to produce sort of or commentary on universal knowledge ii of bea trice and her dea th 27 nine times now since my birth the heaven of light had turned almost to the same point in its own gyration when the glorious lady of my mind who was called beatrice by many who knew not why she was so called ﬁrst appeared before my eyes she had already been in this life so long that in its course the starry heaven had moved toward the region of the east one of the twelve parts of degree so that at about the beginning of her ninth year she appeared to and i near the end of my ninth year saw her she appeared to clothed in most noble color modest and becoming crimson and she was girt and adorned in such wise beﬁtted her very youthful age from that time forward love lorded it over my soul which had been so speedil y wedded to him and he began to exercise over such control and such lordship through the power which my imagination gave to him that it behooved to complete ly all his pleasure he commanded ofttimes that i should seek to see this youthful angel so that 156 26 157 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https in my boyhood often went seeking her and saw her of such noble and praiseworthy deportment that truly of her might be said that word of the poet homer she seems not the daughter of mortal man but of god and tho her image which stayed constantly with gave assurance to love to hold lordship over yet it was of such noble virtue that it never suffered love to rule without the faithful counsel of the reason in those matters in which it was useful to hear such counsel and since to dwell upon the passions and actions of such early youth seems like telling an idle tale i will leave them and passing over many things which might be drawn from the original where these lie hidden i will come to those words which are written in my memory under lar ger paragraphs when so many days had passed that nine years were exactly complete since the described apparition of this most gentle lady on the last of these days it happened that this admirable lady appeared to clothed in purest white between two gentle ladies who were of greater age and passing along street she turned her eyes toward that place where i stood very timidly and by her ineffable courtesy which is rewarded in the eternal world saluted with such virtue that it seemed to be then that i saw all the bounds of bliss and since it was the ﬁrst time that her words came to my ears i took in such sweetness that it were intoxicated i turned away from the folk and betaking myself to the solitude of my own chamber i sat myself down to think of this most courteous lady then it came to pass that walking on road alongside of which was ﬂowing very clear stream so great desire to say somewha t in verse came upon that i began to consider the method i should observe and i thought that to speak of her would not be becoming unless i were to speak to ladies in the second person and not to every lady but only to those who are gentle and are not wome n merely then i say that my tongue spoke if moved of its own accord and said ladies that have the intelligence of love these words i laid up in my mind with great joy thinking to take them my beginning wherefore then having returned to the city after some days of thought i began canzone with this beginning this most gentle lady came into such favor among the people that when she passed along the way persons ran to see her which gave wonderful joy and when she was near any one such modesty came into his heart that he dared not raise his eyes or return her salutation and of this many having experienced it could bear witness to whoso might not believe it she crowned and clothed with humility took her way showing pride in that which she saw and heard many said when she had passed this is not woman rather she is one of the most beautiful angels of heaven and others said she is marvel blest be the lord who can work thus admirably i say that she showed herself so gentle and so full of all pleasantness that those who looked on her comprehended in themselves pure and sweet delight such they could not after tell in words nor was there any who might look upon her but that at ﬁrst he needs must sigh these and more admirable things proceeded from her admirably and with power wherefore i thinking upon this desiring to resume the style of her praise resolved to say words in which i would set forth her admirable and excellent inﬂuences to the end that not only those who might actually behold her but also others should know of her whatever words could tell i was yet full of the design of this canzone and had completed one stanza thereof when the lord of justice called this most gentle one to glory under the banner of that holy queen mary whose name was ever spoken with greatest reverence by this blest beatrice on that day on which the year was complete since this lady was made one of the denizens of life eternal i was seated in place where having her in mind i was drawing an angel upon certain tablets and while i was drawing it i turned my eyes and saw at my side men to whom it was meet to honor they were looking on what i did and was afterward told they had been there already some time before i became aware of it when i saw them i rose and saluting them said another was just now with and on that account i was in thought and when they had gone away i returned to my work 158 159 160 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https that of drawing ﬁgures of angels and while doing this thought came to of saying words in rime if an anniversary poem of her and of address ing those persons who had come to after this two gentle ladies sent to ask to send them some of these rimed words of mine wherefore i thinking on their nobleness resolved to send to them and to make new thing which i would send to them with these in order that i might fulﬁl their prayers with the more honor and i devised then sonnet which relates my condition and i sent it to them after this wonderful vision appeared to in which i saw things which made resolve to speak more of the blest one until i could more worthily treat of her and to attain to this i study to the utmost of my power she truly knows so that if it shall please him through whom all things live that my life be prolonged some years i hope to say of her what was never said of any woman and then may it please him who is the lord of grace that my soul may go to behold the glory of its lady namely of that blest beatrice who in glory looks upon the face of him qui est per omnia sæcula benedictus who is blest forever footnotes from the new life

naples in 1330 returned to florence about 1341 where he lectured on dante several times sent abroad ambassador his chief work the decameron comprising one hundred stories published collectively in

in village not far from his palace and thinking he might live comfortably enough with her he determined without seeking any further to marry her the people all declared themsel ves pleased and promised to regard her in all things their mistress afterward they made preparations most noble feast and the like did the prince inviting all his relations and the great lords in all parts and provinces about him he had also most rich and costly robes made shaped by person that seemed to be of the same size with his intended spouse and provided girdle ring and ﬁne coronet with everything requisite bride and when the day appointed was come about the third hour he mounted his horse attended by all his friends and vassals and having everything in readiness he said my lords and gentlemen it is now time to go my new spouse so on they rode to the village and when he was come near the father house he saw her carrying some water from the well in great haste to go afterward with some of her acquaintances to see the new marchioness when he called her by her name which was 28 167 168 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https and inquired where her father was she modestly replied my gracious lord he is in the house he then alighted from his horse commanding them all to wait him and went alone into the cottage where he found the father who was called giannucolo and said to him honest man i am come to espouse thy daughter but would ﬁrst ask her some questions before thee he then inquired whether she would make it her study to please him and not be uneasy at any time whatever he should or say and whether she would always be obedient with more to that purpose to which she answered yes he then led her out by the hand and ordering the rich apparel to be brought whic h he had provided he had her clothed completely and coronet set upon her head all disordered her hair was after which every one being in amaze he said behold this is the person whom i intend my wife provided she will accept of her husband then turning toward her who stood quite abashed will you said he have your husband she replied yes if it so please your lordship well he replied and i take you my wife so he espoused her in that public manne r and mounting her on palfrey cond ucted her honorably to his palace celebrating the nuptials with much pomp and grandeur tho he had been married to the daughter of the king of france and the young bride showed apparently that with her garments she had changed both her mind and behavior she had most agreeable person and was so amiable and so withal that she seemed rather lord daughter than poor shepherd at which every one that knew her before was greatly surprized she was so obedient also to her husband and so obliging in all respects that he thought himself the happiest man in the world and to her subjects likewise so gracious and condescending that they all honored and loved her their own lives praying her health and prosperity and declaring contrary to their former opinion that gualtieri was the most prudent and prince in the whole world that one could have discerned such virtues under mean habit and country disguise but himself in very short time her discreet behavior and good works were the common subject of discourse not in that country alone but everywhere else and what had been objected to the prince with regard to his marrying her now took contrary turn they had not lived long together before she proved with child and at length brought forth daughter which he made great rejoicings but soon afterward new fancy came into his head and that was to make trial of her patience by long and intolerable sufferings so he began with harsh word s and an appearance of great her that his subjects were greatly displeased with her her mean parentage especially they saw she bore children and that they did nothing but murmur at the daughter already born which when she heard without changing countenance or her resolution in any respect she replied my lord pray dispose of you think most your honor and happiness i shall entirely acquiesce knowing myself to be meaner than the meanest of the people and that i was altogether unworthy of that dignity to which your favor was pleased to advance this was very agreeable to the prince seeing that she was in way elevated with the honor he had conferred upon her afterward having often told her in general terms that his subjects could not bear with the daughter that was born of her he sent one of his servants whom he had instructed what to who with very sorrowful countenance said to her madam i must either lose my own life or obey my lord commands now he has ordered to take your daughter without saying anything more she hearing these words and noting the fellow looks remembering also what she had heard before from her lord concluded that he had orders to destroy the child so she took it out of the cradle kissed it and gave it her blessing when without changing countenance tho her heart throbbed with maternal affection she tenderly laid it in the servant arms and said take it and what thy lord and mine has commanded but prithee leave it not to be devoured by the fowls or wild beasts unless that be his will taking the child he acquainted the prince with what she said who was greatly surprized at her constancy and he sent the same person with it to relation at bologna desiring her without revealing whose child it was to see it carefully brought up and educated afterward the 169 170 171 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https became with child second time and was delivered of son at which he was extremely pleased but not satisﬁed with what he had already done he began to grieve and persecute her still more saying one day to her seemingly much out of temper since thou hast brought this son i am able to live longer with my people they mutiny to that degree that poor shepherd grandson is to succeed and be their lord after that unless i would run the risk of being driven out of my dominions i must needs dispose of this child i did of the other and then send thee away in order to take wife more suitable to she heard this with great deal of resignation making only this reply my lord study only your own ease and happiness without the least care nothing is agreeable to but what is pleasing to yourself not many days after he sent the son in the same manner he had done the daughter and seeming also if he had procured him to be destroyed had him conveyed to bologna to be taken care of with the daughter this she bore with the same resolution before at which the prince wondered greatly declaring to himself that other woman was capable of doing the like and were it not that he had observed her extremely fond of her children while that was agreeable to him he should have thought it want of affection in her but he saw it was only her entire obedience and condesc ension the people imagining that the children were both put to death blamed him to the last degree thinking him the most cruel and worst of men and showing great compassion the lady who whenever she was in company with the ladies of her acquaintance and they condoled with her her loss would only say it was not my will but his who begot them but more years being now passed and he resolving to make the last trial of her patience declared before many people that he could longer bear to keep griselda his wife owning that he had done very foolishly and like young man in marrying her and that he meant to solicit the pope dispensation to take another and send her away which he was much blamed by many worthy persons but he said nothing in return only that it should be so she hearing this and expecting to go home to her father and possibly tend the cattle she had done before while she saw some other lady possest of him whom she dearly loved and honored was perhaps secretly grieved but she had withstood other strokes of fortune so she determined resolutely to now soon afterward gualtieri had counterfeit letters come to him from rome acquainting all his people that his holiness thereby dispensed with his marrying another and turning away griselda he then brought her before him and said woman by the pope leave i may dispose of thee and take another wife my ancestors then have been all sovereign princes of this country and thine only peasants i intend to keep thee longer but to send thee back to thy father cottage with the same fortune which thou broughtest and afterward to make choice of one more suitable in quality to myself it was with the utmost difﬁculty she could now refrain from tears and she replied my lord i was always sensible that my servile condition would way accord with your high rank and descent what i have been i own myself indebted to providence and you i considered it favor lent you are now pleased to demand it back i therefore willingly restore it behold the ring with which you espoused i deliver it you you bid take the dowry back which i brought you you will have need teller to count it nor i purse to put it in much less sumpter horse to carry it away so she left his palace in that manner and returned weeping to her father to the great grief of all who saw her the poor man never supposing that the prince would keep her so long his wife and expecting this thing to happen every day safely laid up the garments of which she had been despoiled the day he espoused her he now brought them to her and she put them on and went usual about her father little household affairs bearing this ﬁerce trial of adverse fortune with the greatest coura ge imaginable the prince then gave out that he was to espouse daughter of one of the counts of panago and seeming if he made great preparations his nuptials he sent griselda to come to him and said to her i am going to bring this lady home whom i have just married and intend to show her all possible respect at her ﬁrst coming thou knowest that i have woman with able to 172 173 174 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https out the rooms and many other things which are requisite on so solemn an occasion therefore thou art best acquainted with the state of the house i would have thee make such provision thou shalt judge proper and invite what ladies thou wilt even tho thou wert mistress of the house and when the marriage is ended get thee home to thy father again tho these words pierced like daggers to the heart of griselda who was unable to part with her love the prince so easily she had done with her great fortune yet she replied my lord i am ready to fulﬁl all your commands she then went in her coarse attire into the palace and with her own hands did she begin to sweep and set all the rooms to rights cleaning the stools and benches in the hall like the meanest servant and directing what was to be done in the kitchen never giving over till everything was in order and it ought to be after this was done she invited in the prince name all the ladies in the country to come to the feast and on the day appointed the marriage meanly clad she was she received them in the most genteel and cheerful manner imaginable now gualtieri who had his children carefully brought up at bologna the girl being about twelve years old and one of the prettiest creatures that ever was seen and the boy six had sent to his kinswoman there to desire she would bring them with an honorable retinue to saluzzo giving it out all the way she came that she was bringing the young lady to be married to him without letting any one know to the contrary accordingly they all three set forward attended by goodly train of gentry and after some days traveling reached saluzzo about dinner when they found the whole company assembled waiting to see their new lady the young lady was most graciously received by all the women present and being come into the hall where the tables were all covered griselda meanly drest she was went cheerfully to meet her saying your ladyship is most kindly welcome the ladies who had greatly importuned the prince tho to purpose to let griselda be in room by herself or else that she might have some of her own clothes and not appear before strangers in that manner were now seated and going to be served round while the young lady was universally admired and every one said that the prince had made good change but griselda in particular highly commended both her and her brother the marquis now thinking that he had seen enough with regard to his wife patience and perceiving that in all her trials she was still the same being persuaded likewise that this proceeded from want of understanding in her because he knew her to be singularly prudent he thought it time to take her from that anguish which he supposed she might conceal under her ﬁrm and constant deportment so making her come before all the company he said with smile what thinkest thou grisel of my bride my lord she replied i like her extremely well and if she be prudent she is fair you may be the happiest man in the world with her but i most humbly beg that you would not take those measures with this lady you did with your last wife because she is young and has been tenderly educated whereas the other was inured to hardships from child gualtieri perceiving that tho griselda thought that person was to be his wife she nevertheless answered him with great humility and sweetness of temper he made her sit down by him and said griselda it is now time you to reap the fruit of your long patience and that they who have reputed to be cruel unjust and monster in nature may know that what i have done has been all along with view to teach you how to behave wife to show them how to choose and keep wife and lastly to secure my own ease and quiet long we live together which i was apprehensive might have been endangered by my marrying therefore i had mind to prove you by harsh and injurious treatment and not being sensible that you have ever transgrest my will either in word or deed i now seem to have met with that happiness i desired i intend then to restore in one hour what i have taken away from you in many and to make you the sweetest recompense the many bitter pangs i have caused you to suffer accept therefore this young lady whom thou thought my spouse and her brother your children and mine they are the same whom you and many others believed that i had been the means of cruelly murdering and i am your husband who love and value you 175 176 177 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental

daughter was sitting quite astonished with these things and tenderly saluted both her and her brother undeceiving them and the whole company at this the women all arose overjoyed from the tables and taking griselda into the chamber they clothed her with her own noble apparel and marchioness resembling such one even in rags and brought her into the hall and being extremely rejoiced with her son and daughter and every one expressing the utmost satisfaction at what had come to pass the feasting was prolonged many days the marquis was adjudged very wise man tho abundantly too severe and the trial of his lady most intolerable but griselda she was beyond compare footnotes this the most famous of boccaccio stories is the last of those related on the tenth day lowndes manual mentions under

unquestionably very praiseworthy in princes to be faithful to their engagements but among those of the present day who have been distinguished great exploits few indeed have been remarkable this virtue or have scrupled to deceive others who may have relied on their good faith it should therefore be known that there are two ways of deciding any contest the one by laws the other by force the ﬁrst is peculiar to men the second to beasts but when laws are not sufﬁciently powerful it is necessary to recur to force prince ought therefore to 29 178 179 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https how to use both these descriptions of arms this doctrine is admirably illustrated to us by the ancient poets in the allegorical history of the education of achilles and many other princes of antiquity by the centaur chiron who under the double form of man and beast taught those who were destined to govern that it was their duty to use by turns the arms adapted to both these natures seeing that one without the other can not be of any durable advantage now prince must learn how to act the part of beast sometimes he should make the fox and the lion his patterns the ﬁrst can but feebly defend himself against the wolf and the latter readily falls into such snares are laid him from the fox therefore prince will learn dexterity in avoiding snares and from the lion how to employ his strength to keep the wolves in awe but they who entirely rely upon the lion strength will not always meet with success in other words prudent prince can not and ought not to keep his word except when he can it without injury to himself or when the circumstances under which he contracted the engagement still exist i should be cautious in inculcating such precept if all men were good but the generality of mankind are wicked and ever ready to break their words prince should not pique himself in keeping his more scrupulously especially it is always easy to justify breach of faith on his part i could give numerous proofs of this and show numberless engagements and treaties which have been violated by the treachery of princes and that those who enacted the part of the fox have always succeeded best in their affairs it is necessary however to disguise the appearance of craft and thoroughly to understand the art of feigning and dissembling men are generally so simple and so weak that he who wishes to deceive easily ﬁnds dupes one example taken from the history of our own times will be sufﬁcient pope alexander vi played during his whole life game of deception and notwithstanding his faithless conduct was extremely well known his artiﬁces always proved successful oaths and protestations cost him nothing never did prince so often break his word or pay less regard to his engagements this was because he so well understood this chapter in the art of government it is not necessary however prince to possess all the good qualities i have enumerated but it is indispensable that he should appear to have them i will even venture to afﬁrm that it is sometimes dangerous to use tho it is always useful to seem to possess them prince should earnestly endeavor to gain the reputation of kindness clemency piety justice and ﬁdelity to his engagements he ought to possess all these good qualities but still retain such power over himself to display their opposites whenever it may be expedient i maintain that prince and especially new prince can not with impunity exercise all the virtues because his own will often compel him to violate the laws of charity religion and humanity he should habituate himself to bend easily to the various circumstances which may from time to time surround him in word it will be useful to him to persevere in the path of rectitude while he feels inconvenience in doing so to know how to deviate from it when circumstances dictate such course he should make it rule above all things never to utter anything which does not breathe of kindness justice good faith and piety this last quality it is most important him to appear to possess men in general judge more from appearance than from reality all men have eyes but few have the gift of penetration every one sees your exterior but few can discern what you have in your heart and those few dare not oppose the voice of the multitude who have the majesty of their prince on their side now in forming judgment of the minds of men and more especially of princes we can not recur to any tribunal we must attend only to results let it then be the prince chief care to maintain his authority the means he employs be what they may will this purpose always appear honorable and meet applause the vulgar are ever caught by appearances and judge only by the event and the world is chieﬂy composed of such are called the vulgar the voice of the few is seldom or never heard or regarded footnotes 180 181 the project gutenberg

successful in casting my medusa i made model of my perseus in wax and ﬂattered myself that i should have the same success in casting the latter in bronze i had had with the former upon its appearing to such advantage and looking so beautiful in wax the duke 32 whether somebody else put it into his head or whether it was notion of his own he came to my house oftener than usual once took occasion to say to benvenuto this statue can not be cast in bronze it is not in the power of your art to compass it hearing him express himself in that manner i discovered great vexation and said my lord i know that your excellency places very little conﬁdence in and that you have but too good an opinion of those who speak ill of or else you not understand things of this nature scarce did he suffer to utter these words when he answered i profess to understand them and i understand them perfectly i replied you may understand them prince but not an artist if you had that skill in these matters which you think you have you would believe on account of that ﬁne bronze head which i cast your excellency and which was sent to the elbe also having restored the beautiful ﬁgure of ganymede work that gave inﬁnite trouble insomuch that it would have been easier to have made new one likewise having cast the medusa which stands here before your excellency performance of immense difﬁculty in which i have done what other man has done before in this most laborious the duke scarcely had patience to hear out but sometimes turned one way sometimes another and i was quite in despair when i recollected the circumstances in which i had lived in france at last he all of sudden said tell benvenuto how is it possible that this ﬁne head of medusa which perseus holds aloft in his hand should ever 30 182 183 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https out cleverly i immediately answered it is clear my lord that you are connoisseur in statuary your excellency boasts yourself if you had any skill in the art you would not be afraid of that ﬁne head not coming out but would express your apprehensions concerning that right foot which is at such distance below the duke addressing himself to some noblemen who were with him said i really believe it is practise of benvenuto to contradict and oppose everything he hears after i had made its coat of earth covered it well and bound it properly with irons i began by means of slow ﬁre to draw off the wax which melted away by many ventholes the more of these are made the better the molds are ﬁlled and when i had entirely stript off the wax i made sort of fence around my perseus that is round the mold above mentioned of bricks piling them one upon another and leavin g several vacuities the ﬁre to exhale at i next began gradually to put on the wood and kept constant ﬁre two days and two night s till the wax being quite off and the mold well baked i began to dig hole to bury my mold in and observed all those ﬁne methods of proceeding that are prescribed by our art when i had completely dug my hole i took my mold and by means of levers and strong cables directed it with care and suspended it cubit above the level of the furnace so that it hung exactly in the middle of the hole i then let it gently down to the very bottom of the furnace and placed it with all the care and exactness i possibly could after i had ﬁnished this part of my task i began to make covering of the very earth i had taken off and in proportion i raised the earth i made vents it which are sort of tubes of baked earth generally used conduits and other things of similar nature soon i saw that i had placed it properly and that this manner of covering it by putting on these small tubes in their proper places was likely to answer also that my journeymen thoroughly understood my plan which was very different from that of all other masters and i was sure that i could depend upon them i turned my thoughts to my furnace i had caused it to be ﬁlled with several pieces of brass and bronze and heaped them upon one another in the manner taught us by our art taking particular care to leave passage the ﬂames that the metal might the sooner assume its color and dissolve into ﬂuid thus i with great alacrity excited my men to lay on the pine wood which because of the oiliness of the resinous matter that oozes from the and that my furnace was admirably well made burne d at such rate that i was continually obliged to run to and fro which greatly fatigued i however bore the hardship but to add to my misfortune the shop took ﬁre and we were all very much afraid the roof would fall in and crush us from another quarter that is from the garden the sky poured in so much rain and wind that it cooled my furnace thus did i continue to struggle with these cross accidents several hours and exerted myself to such degree that my constitution tho robust could longer bear such severe hardship and i was suddenly attacked by most violent intermitting fever in short i was so ill that i found myself under necessity of lying down upon my bed my housekeeper whose name was mona fiora castel del rio was one of the most sensible and affectionate women in the world she rebuked giving way to vain fears and at the same time attended with the greatest kindness and care imaginable however seeing so very ill and terriﬁed to such degree she could not contain herself but shed ﬂood of tears which she endeavored to conceal from while we were both in this deep afﬂiction i perceived man enter the room who in his person appeared to be crooked and distorted great s and began to express himself in these terms with tone of voice dismal and melancholy those who exhort and pray with persons who are going to be executed alas poor benvenuto your work is spoiled and the misfortune admits of remedy sooner had i heard the words uttered by this messenger of evil but i cried out so loud that my voice might be heard to the skies and got out of bed i began immediately to dress and giving plenty of kicks and cuffs to the maidservants and the boy they 184 185 186 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https to help on with my clothes i complained bitterly in these terms you envious and treacherous wretches this is piece of villainy contrived on purpose but i swear by the living god that i will sift it to the bottom and before i die give such proofs who i am shall not fail to astonish the whole world having huddled on my clothes i went with mind boding evil to the shop where i found all those whom i had left so alert and in such high spirits standing in the utmost confusion and astonishment i thereupon addrest them thus listen all of you to what i am going to say and since you either would not or could not follow the method i pointed out obey now that i am present my work is before us and let none of you offer to oppose or contradict such cases this require activity and not counsel hereupon one alessandro lastricati had the assurance to say to look you benvenuto you have undertaken work which our art can not compass and which is not to be ef fected by human power hearing these words i turned round in such passion and seemed so bent on mischief that both he and all the rest unanimously cried out to give your orders and we will all second you in whatever you command we will assist you long we have breath in our bodies these kind and affectiona words they uttered i ﬁrmly believe in persuasion that i was on the point of expiring i went directly to examine the furnace and saw all the metal in it concreted i thereupon ordered two of the helpers to step over the way to capretta butcher load of young oak which had been above year drying and been of fered by maria ginevra wife to the said capretta upon his bringing the ﬁrst bundles of it i began to ﬁll the grate this sort of oak makes brisker ﬁre than any other wood whatever but the wood of elder and trees is used in casting artillery because it makes mild and gentle ﬁre soon the concreted metal felt the power of this violent ﬁre it began to brighten and glitter in another quarter i made them hurry the tubes with all possible expedition and sent some of them to the roof of the house to take care of the ﬁre which through the great violence of the wind had acquired new force and toward the garden i had caused some tables with pieces of tapestry and old clothes to be placed in order to shelter from the rain soon i had applied the proper remedy to each evil i with loud voice cried out to my men to bestir themselves and lend helping hand so that when they saw that the concreted metal began to melt again the whole body obeyed with such zeal and alacrity that every man did the work of three then i caused mass of pewter weighing about sixty pounds to be thrown upon the metal in the furnace which with the other helps the brisk wood ﬁre and stirring it sometimes with iron and sometimes with long poles soon became completely dissolved finding that contrary to the opinion of my ignorant assistants i had effected what seemed difﬁcult to raise the dead i recovered my vigor to such degree that i longer perceived whether i had any fever nor had i the least apprehension of death suddenly loud noise was heard and glittering of ﬁre ﬂashed before our eyes if it had been the darting of thunderbolt upon the appearance of this extraordinary phenomenon terror seized on all present and on none more than myself this tremendous noise being over we bega n to stare at each other and perceived that the cover of the furnace had burst and ﬂown of f so that the bronze began to run i immediately caused the mouths of my mold to be opened but ﬁnding that the metal did not run with its usual velocity and apprehending that the cause of it was that the fusibility of the metal was injured by the violence of the ﬁre i ordered all my dishes and porringers which were in number about two hundred to be placed one by one before my tubes and part of them to be thrown into the furnace upon which all present perceived that my bronze was completely dissolv ed and that my mold was ﬁlling they now with joy and alacrity assisted and obeyed i my part was sometimes in one place sometimes in another giving my directi ons and assisting my men before whom i offered up this prayer god i address myself to thee who of thy divine power didst rise from the dead and ascend in glory to heaven i acknowledge in gratitude this mercy that my mold has been ﬁlled i fall prostra before thee and with my whole heart return thanks to thy divine majesty my prayer being over i took plate of meat which stood 187 188 189 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https little bench and ate with great appetite i then drank with all my journeymen and assistants and went joyful and in good health to bed there were still two hours of night and i rested well if i had been troubled with manner of disorder my good housekeeper without my having given any orders had provided young capon my dinner when i arose which was not till about noon she accosted in high spirits and said merrily is this the man that thought himself dying it is my ﬁrm belief that the cuffs and kicks which you gave us last night when you were quite frantic and possest frightened away your fever which apprehending lest you should fall upon it in the same manner took to ﬂight so my whole poor family having got over such panics and hardships without delay procured earthen vessels to supply the place of the pewter dishes and porringers and we all dined together very cheerfully indeed i not remember having ever in my life eaten meal with greater satisfaction or with better appetite my mortal enemy pier francesco ricci the duke steward was very eager to know how the affair had turned out so that the two whom i suspected of being the cause of my metal concreting in the manner above related told that i was not man but rather downright devil i had compassed that which was not in the power of art to effect with many other surprizing things which would have been too much even the infernal powers they greatly exaggerated what had passed perhaps with view of excusing themselves the steward wrote to the duke who was then at pisa an account still more pompous and more replete with the marvelous than that which the workmen had given him having left my work to cool during two days after it was cast i began gradually to uncover it i ﬁrst of all found the medusa head which had come out admirably by the assistance of the vents i had observe d to the duke that the property of ﬁre was to ﬂy upward i proceeded to uncover the rest and found that the other head i mean that of perseus was likewise come out perfectl y well this occasioned still greater surprize because it is seen in the statue it is much lower than that of medusa the mouth of that ﬁgure being placed over the head and shoulders of perseus i found that where the head of perseus ends all the bronze was exhausted which i had in my furnace this surprized very much that there should not be anything over and above what is necessary in casting my astonishment indeed was raised to such degree that i looked upon it miracle immediately wrought by the almighty i went on uncovering it with great success and found every part turn out to admiration till i reached the foot of the right leg which supports the ﬁgure where i found the heel come out so proceeding to examine it and thinking that the whole was ﬁlled up in one respect i was glad in another sorry because i had told the duke it would not have that effect continuing however to uncover it i found that not only the toes were wanting but part of the foot itself so that there was almost deﬁcient this occasioned some new trouble but i was not displeased at it because i could thereby convince the duke that i understood my business thoroughly and tho there had come out great deal more of that foot than i thought there would the reason was that in consequence of the several accidents that had happened it was heated much more than it could have been in the regular course of especially the pewter plates had been thrown into the furnace thing

commensurate to and worthy of their labors and merits raphael was born at most renowned city of good friday of the year 1483 at three of the night his father was certain giovanni santi painter of great eminence in his art but man of sufﬁcient intelligence nevertheless and perfectly competent to direct his children into that good way which had not his misfortune been laid open to himself in his younger days and ﬁrst he knew how important it is that child should be nourished by the milk of its own mother and not by that of the hired nurse so he determined when his son raphael to whom he gave that name at his baptism being one of good augury was born to him that the mother 34 of the child he having indeed he never had herself be the nurse of the child giovanni further desired that in his tender years the boy should rather be brought up to the habits of his own family and beneath his paternal roof than be sent 32 192 193 194 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics

therefore before raphael tho still but child became valuable assistant to his father in the numerous works which the latter executed in the state of urbino at length this good and affectionate father knowing that his son would acquire but little of his art from himself resolved to place him with pietro perugino who according to what giovanni had been told was then considered to hold the ﬁrst place among the painters of the time wherefore proceeding to perugia that purpose and ﬁnding pietro to be absent from the city he occupied the end that he might await the return of the master with the less incon the execution of certain works the church of san francesco in that place but when pietro had returned to perugia giovanni who was person of very good manners and pleasing deportm ent soon formed an amicable acquaintanceship with him and when the proper opportunity arrived made known to him the desire he had conceived in the most suitable manner that he could devise thereupon pietro who was also exceedingly courteous well lover of ﬁne genius agreed to accept the care of raphael giovanni then returned to urbino and having taken the boy tho not without many tears from his mother who loved him tenderly he conducted him to perugia when pietro sooner beheld his manner of drawing and observed the pleasing deportment of the youth than he conceived that opinion of him which was in due time so amply conﬁrmed by the results produced in the after life of raphael but i have now discoursed respecting these questions of art at more length perhaps than was needful and will return to the life and death of raphael this master lived in the strictest intimacy with bernardo divizio cardinal of bibbiena who had many years importuned him to take wife of his selection nor had raphael directly refused compliance with the wishes of the cardinal but had put the matter off by saying that he would wait some three or four years longer the term which he had thus set approached before raphael had thought of it when he was reminded by the cardinal of his promise and being he ever was just and upright he would not depart from his word and therefore accepted niece of the cardinal himself his wife but this engagement was nevertheless very heavy restraint to him he put off the marriage from time to time insomuch that several months passed and the ceremony had not yet taken place 35 yet this was not done without very honorable motive raphael having been many years in the service of the count and being the creditor of leo x large sum of money had received an intimation to the effect that when the hall with which he was then occupied was completed the pontif f intended to reward him his labors well to honor to his talents by bestowing on him the red hat of which he meant to distribute considerable number many of them being designed persons whose merits were greatly inferior to those of raphael the painter meanwhile did not abandon the light attachment by which he was enchained and one day on returning to his house from one of these secret visits he was seized with violent fever 36 which being mistaken cold the physicians inconsiderately caused him to be bled whereby he found hims elf exhausted when he had rather required to be strengthened thereupon he made his will and good christian he sent the object of his attachment from the house but left her sufﬁcient provision wherewith she might live in decency having done so much he divided his property among his disciples giulio romano that is to say whom he always loved greatly and giovanni francesco with whom was joined certain priest of urbino who was his kinsman but whose name i not know he furthermore commanded that certain portion of his property should be employed in the restoration of one of the ancient tabernacles in santa maria ritonda 37 which he had selected his and which he had ordered that an altar with the ﬁgure of our lady in marble should be prepared all that he possest besides he bequeathed

embellished the world by his talents while on earth so is it to be believed that his soul is now adorning heaven after his death the body of raphael was placed at the upper end of the hall wherein he had last worked with the picture of the transﬁguration which he had executed cardinal ginlio medici at the head of the corpse he who regarding that living picture afterward turned to consider that dead body felt his heart bursting with grief he beheld them the loss of raphael caused the cardinal to command that this work should be placed on the high altar of san pietro montorio where it has ever since been held in the utmost veneration its own great value well the excellence of its author the remains of this divine artist received that honorable sepulture which the noble spirit whereby they had been informed had so well deserved nor was there any artist in rome who did not deeply bewail the loss sustained by the departure of the master or who failed to accompany his remains to their repose the death of raphael was in like manner deplored by all the papal court not only because he had formed part thereof since he had held the ofﬁce of chamberlain to the pontif f but also because leo x had esteemed him so highly that his loss occasi oned that sovereign the bitterest grief most happy and thrice blest spirit of whom all are proud to speak whose actions are celebrated with praise by all men and the least of whose works left behind thee is admired and prized when this noble artist died well might painting have departed also when he closed his eyes she too was left it were blind but now to us whose lot it is to come after him there remains to imitate the good or rather the excellent of which he has left us the example and our obligations to him and his great merits well deserve to retain the most grateful remembrance of him in our hearts while we ever maintain his memory in the highest honor with our lips to him of truth it is that we owe the possession of invention coloring and execution brought alike and altogether to that point of perfection which few could have dared to hope nor has any man ever aspired to pass before him and in addition to the beneﬁts which this great master conferred on art being he was its best friend we have the further obligation to him of having taught us by his life in what manner we should comport ourselves toward great men well toward those of lower degree and even toward the lowest nay there was among his many extraordinary gifts one of such value and importance that i can never sufﬁciently admire it and always think thereof with astonishment this was the power accorded to him by heaven of bringing all who approached his presence into harmony an effect inconceivably surprizing in our calling and contrary to the nature of our artists yet all i not say of the inferior grades only but even those who lay claim to be great personages and of this humor our art produces immense numb ers became of one mind once they

knew to certain extent the vicissitudes of my past life i replied that i would gladly settle there if the king would give suitable appointment but when i asked him to speak to the king he replied that that would more harm than good his majesty piques himself on knowing men better than any one else he likes to judge them himself sometimes he discovers merit when one else sees any and sometimes vice

to your credit i my lord write to king to whom i have introduction i could not think of it but you wish to speak to him you not certainly that is enough your letter need contain nothing but the

sentinel i went up short staircase and opening door found myself in guardian came up and offered to show the collection i did not come here to admire these works of art i said but to speak to the king who told he would be in the garden at this moment he is at his concert playing the ﬂute is his dessert after dinner and he treats himself to it every day did he ﬁx any hour yes four but he may have gotten he never gets he will be punctual and you had better wait in the garden i had not been there long when i saw him approaching the king followe d by his secretary and ﬁne spaniel soon he saw he pronounced my name at the same time taking of f his bad old hat he then asked in terrible voice what i wanted i stood looking at him in silence well ca you speak is it you who wrote to yes sire but now i ca remember what i had to say i did not think the majesty of king could so dazzle my senses i shall be better prepared in future my lord marshal ought to have warned ah he knows you does he come let us walk about what did you wish to say what you think of this garden he ordered to speak of his garden i should have said i knew nothing of gardens to any one else but if he chose to think connoisseur i must fain pretend to be one at the risk of exposing my ignorance i replied that it was superb but he said the gardens at versailles are far ﬁner i own it sire but that is because of the fountains true but it is not my fault there is water here i have spent more than three hundred thousand crowns but without success three hundred thousand crowns sire if your majesty spent that sum there should have been abundance of water ah ah i see you are hydraulic architect could i tell him he was mistaken i was afraid of displeasing him so i simply bent my head this could be taken yes or thank god he did not continue to talk on this subject or i should have been terribly put to it i did not know the very rudiments of hydraulics still walking up and down and turning his head right and

of subject and his sudden digressions i felt tho i had been called on to act in one of those improvised italian comedies in which if the actor stops short word the pit and the gallery hiss him mercilessly i immediately assumed the style of ﬁnancier and replied that i was acquainted with the theory of taxation that is what i want he replied the practise does not concern you there are three kinds of taxes taking into consideration their effects one is ruinous one is unfortunately necessary and the third is always excellent that is good go on the ruinous tax is the royal tax the necessary one is the military one and the excellent one is the popular tax i wanted to throw him of f his beat little i had not got up my subject the royal tax sire is the one which empties the purses of the subjects to swell the coffers of the sovereign and that is the ruinous one you say always sire it stops the circulation of money which is the soul of comm erce and the backbone of the state yet you consider the army tax necessary unfortunately necessary war is dire calamity perhaps and how about the popular tax it is always excellent what the king takes from his people with one hand he gives them back with the other turning it into useful channels protecting science and art and so contributing to the general social in fact the king adds to general happiness by employing the money drawn from the taxes his wisdom dictates there is good deal of truth in what you say doubt you know calsabigi i ought to know him sire we established the genoese lottery in paris together seven years ago and under what head would you class that tax if you admit it to be one it is one sire and not one of the least important it is good tax if the king spends the proﬁts in useful manner but supposing he loses one chance in ﬁfty sire is that the result of an exact calculation exact sire all political calculations they are often wrong they are never wrong sire if god remains neutral 204 205 the project

about the moral calculations but i not like your genoese lottery it seems to mere swindle and i would not have anything to with it even if i were certain to win always your majesty is right the public would never support lotteries were they not led away by false security then he tried one or two other points but i met him without ﬂinching suddenly he stopt short and looked over from head to foot you know that you are very handsome man is it possible sire that after long scientiﬁc dissertation your majesty can credit with merely the qualities which distinguish your majesty grenadiers the king smiled with kind malice then said it seems that lord keith knows you i will speak to him about you he then took off his hat again he was never chary of his bows and i making him profound reverence

village learned man and graduate of siguenza to which had been the better knight palmerin of england or amadis of gaul master nicholas the village barber however used to say that neither of them came up to the knight of phœbus and that if there was any could compare with him it was don galaor the brother of amadis of gaul because he had spirit that was equal to every occasion and was ﬁnikin knight nor lachrymose like his brother while in the matter of valor he was not whit behind him in short he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise and his days from dawn to dark poring over them and what with little sleep and much reading his brains got so dry that he lost his wits his fancy grew full of what he used to read about in his enchantments quarrels battles challenges wounds wooings loves agonies and all sorts of impossible nonsense and it so possest his mind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read of was true that to him history in the world had more reality in it he used to say the cid ruy diaz was very good knight but that he was not to be compared with the knight of the burning sword who with one cut in half two ﬁerce and monstrous giants he thought more of bernardo del carpio because at roncesvalles he slew roland in spite of enchantments availing himself of the artiﬁce of hercules when he strangled antæus the son of terra in his arms he approved highly of the giant morgante because altho of the giant breed which is always arrogant and he alone was affable and well bred but above all he admired reinaldos of montalban especially when he saw him sallying forth from his castle and robbing every one he met and when beyond the seas he stole that image of mohammed which history says was entirely of gold and to

scoured and polished it best he could but he perceived one great defect in it that it had closed helmet nothing but simple morion this deﬁciency however his ingenuity supplied he contrived kind of of pasteboard which ﬁtted on to the morion looked like whole one it is true that in order to see if it was strong and ﬁt to stand cut he drew his sword and gave it couple of slashes the ﬁrst of which undid in an instant what had taken him week to the ease with which he had knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat and to guard against that danger he set to work again ﬁxing bars of iron on the

his hack which with more quartos than real and more blemishes than the steed of gonela that tantum pellis et ossa fuit surpassed in his eyes the bucephalus of alexander or the babieca of the cid four days were spent in thinking what name to give him because he said to himself it was not right that horse belonging to knight so famous and one with such merits of his own should be without some distinctive name and he strove to adapt it so to indicate what he had been before belonging to and what he then was it was only reasonable that his master taking new character he should take new name

in this state strove by all the means in their power to cheer him up the bachelor bidding him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life which he himself he said had already composed an eclogue that would take the shine out of all sannazaro 48 had ever written and had bought with his own money two famous dogs to guard the ﬂock one called barcino and the other butron which herdsman of

published after his death the emperor new clothes 49 many years ago there was an emperor who was so excessively fond of new clothes that he spent all his money in dress he did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers nor did he care to go either to the theat er or the chase except the opportunities then afforded him displaying his new clothes he had different suit each hour of the day and of any other king or emperor one is accustomed to say he is sitting in council it was always said of him the emperor is sitting in his wardrobe time passed away merrily in the large town which was his capital strangers arrived every day at the court one day two rogues calling themselves weavers made their appearance they gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns the clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to every one who was unﬁt the ofﬁce he held or who was extraordinarily simple in character 230 47 48 231 232 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https these must indeed be splendid clothes thought the emperor had i such suit i might at once ﬁnd out what men in my realm are unﬁt their ofﬁce and also be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish this stuff must be woven immediately and he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly so the two pretended weavers set up two looms and affected to work very busily tho in reality they did nothing at all they asked the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread put both into their own knapsacks and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until late at night i should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth said the emperor to himself after some little time had elapsed he was however rather embarrassed when he remembered that simpleton or one unﬁt his ofﬁce would be unable to see the manufacture to be sure he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person but yet he would prefer sending somebody else to bring him intelligence about the weavers and their work before he troubled himself in the affair all the people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to possess and all were anxious to learn how wise or how ignorant their neighbors might prove to be i will send my faithful old minister to the weavers said the emperor at last after some deliberation he will be best able to see how the cloth looks he is man of sense and one can be more suitable his ofﬁce than he is so the honest old minister went into the hall where the knaves were working with all their might at their empty looms what can be the meaning of this though t the old man opening his eyes very wide i can not discover the least bit of thread on the looms however he did not express his thoughts aloud the impostors requested him very courteously to be so good to come nearer their looms and then asked him whether the design pleased him and whether the colors were not very beautiful at same time pointing to the empty frames the poor old minister looked and looked he could not discover anything on the looms very good reason there was nothing there what thought he again is it possible that i am simpleton i have never thought so myself and at any rate if i am so one must know it can it be that i am unﬁt my ofﬁce that must not be said either i will never confess that i could not see the stuf well sir minister said one of the knaves still pretending to work you not say whether the stuf f pleases you oh it is admirable replied the old minister looking at the loom through his spectacles this pattern and the i will tell the emperor without delay how very beautiful i think them we shall be much obliged to you said the impostors and then they named the different colors and described the patterns of the pretended stuff the old minister listened attentively to their words in order that he might repeat them to the emperor and then the knaves asked more silk and gold saying that it was necessary to complete what they had begun however they put all that was given them into their knapsacks and continued to work with much apparent diligence before at their empty looms the emperor now sent another ofﬁcer of his court to see how the men were getting on and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready it was just the same with this gentleman with the minister he surveyed the looms on all sides but could see nothing at all but the empty frames does not the stuff appear beautiful to you it did to my lord the minister asked the impostors of the emperor second ambassador at the same time making the same gestures before and talking of the design and colors which were not there 233 234 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https i certainly am not stupid thought the messenger it must be that i am not ﬁt my good proﬁtable ofﬁce that is very odd however one shall know anything about it and accordingly he praised the stuff he could not see and declared that he was delighted with both colors and patterns indeed please your imperial majesty said he to his sovereign when he returned the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magniﬁcent the whole city was talking of the splen did cloth which the emperor had ordered to be woven at his own expense and now the emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture while it was still on the loom accompanied by select number of ofﬁcers of the court among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth he went to the crafty impostors who soon they were aware of the emperor approach went on work ing more diligently than ever altho they still did not pass single thread through the looms is not the work absolutely magniﬁcen t said the two ofﬁcers of the crown already mentioned if your majesty will only be pleased to look at it what splendid design what glorious colors and at the same time they pointed to the empty frames they imagined that every one but themselves could see this exquisite piece of workmanship how is this said the emperor to himself i can see nothing this is indeed terrible affair am i simpleton or am i unﬁt to be an emperor that would be the worst thing that could happen oh the cloth is charming said he aloud it has my entire approbation and he smiled most graciously and looked closely at the empty looms on account would he say that he could not see what two of the ofﬁcers of his court had praised so much all his retinue now strained their eyes hoping to discover something on the looms but they could see more than the others nevertheless they all exclaimed oh how beautiful and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material the approaching procession magniﬁcent charming excellent resounded on all sides and every one was uncommonly gay the emperor shared in the general satisfaction and presented the impostors with the ribbon of an order of knighthood to be worn in their buttonholes and the title of gentlemen weavers the rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place and had sixteen lights burning so that every one might see how anxious they were to ﬁnish the emperor new suit they pretended to roll the cloth off the looms cut the air with their scissors and sewed with needles without any thread in them see cried they at last the emperor new clothes are ready and now the emperor with all the grandees of his court came to the weavers and the rogues raised their arms if in the act of holding something up saying here are your majesty

translation of the pretenders by william archer 250 251 51 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https leo tolst oy born in 1828 educated at the university of kazan served in the army and commander of battery in the crimea in 1855 being present at the storming of sebastopol sent special courier to petersbur g lived on his estate after the liberation of the serfs working with the peasants and devoting himself to literary work published war and peace in anna karenina in sebastopol in childhood boyhood and youth and the kreutzer sonata in 1890 and war in shakespeare not grea t genius 52 i remember the astonishment i felt when i ﬁrst read shakespeare i expected to receive powerful esthetic pleasure but having read one after the other works regarded his best king lear romeo and juliet hamlet and macbeth not only did i feel delight but i felt an irresistible repulsion and tedium and doubted to whet her i was senseless in feeling works regarded the summit of perfection by the whole of the civilized world to be trivial and positively bad or whether the signiﬁcance which this civilized world attributes to the works of shakespeare was itself senseless my consternation was increased by the fact that i always keenly felt the beauties of poetry in every form then why should artistic works recognized by the whole world those of works of only fail to please but be disagreeable to long time i could not believe in myself and during ﬁfty years in order to test myself i several times recommenced reading shakespeare in every possible form in russian in english in german and in schlegel translation i was advised several times i read the dramas and the comedies and historical plays and i invariably underwent the same feelings repulsion weariness and bewilderment at the present time being desirous once more to test myself i have an old man of again read the whole of shakespeare including the historical plays the henrys troilus and cressida the tempest cymbeline and i have felt with even greater force the same time however not of bewilderment but of ﬁrm indubitable conviction that the unquestionable glory of great genius which shakespeare enjoys and which compels writers of our time to imitate him and readers and spectators to discover in him distorting their esthetic and ethical great evil is every untruth altho i know that the majority of people so ﬁrmly believe in the greatness of shakespeare that in reading this judgment of mine they will not admit even the possibility of its justice and will not give it the slightest attention nevertheless i will endeavor well i can to show why i believe that shakespeare can not be recognized either great genius or even an average author however hopeless it may seem i will endeavor to demonstrate in the selected drama king lear those faults equally characteristic also of all the other tragedies and comedies of shakespeare on account of which he not only is not representing model of dramatic art but does not satisfy the most elementary demands of art recognized by all dramatic art according to the laws established by those very critics who extol shakespeare demands that the persons represented in the play should be in consequence of actions proper to their characters and owing to natural course of events placed in positions requiring them to struggle with the surrounding world to which they ﬁnd themselves in opposition and in this struggle should display their inherent qualities 252 253 254 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume viii of 10 continental https king lear the persons represented are indeed placed externally in opposition to the outward world and they struggle with it but their strife does not ﬂow from the natural course of events nor from their own characters but is quite arbitrarily established by the author and therefore can not produce on the reader the illusion which represents the essential condition of art lear has necessity or motive his abdication also having lived all his life with his daughters has reason to believe the words of the two elders and not the truthful statement of the youngest yet upon this is built the whole tragedy of his position similarly unnatural is the subordinate action the relation of gloucester to his sons the positions of gloucester and edgar ﬂow from the circumstance that gloucester just like lear immediately believes the coarsest untruth and does not even endeavor to inquire of his injured son whether what he is accused of be true but at once curses and banishes him the fact that lear relations with his daughters are the same those of gloucester to his sons makes one feel yet more strongly that in both cases the relations are quite arbitrary and not ﬂow from the characters nor the natural course of events equally unnatural and obviously invented is the fact that all through the tragedy lear does not recognize his old courtier kent and therefore the relations between lear and kent fail to excite the sympathy of the reader or spectator the same in yet greater degree holds true of the position of edgar who unrecognized by any one leads his blind father and persuades him that he has leapt off cliff when in reality gloucester jumps on level ground these positions into which the characters are placed quite arbitrarily are so unnatural that the reader or spectator is unable not only to sympathize with their sufferings but even to be interested in what he reads or sees this in the ﬁrst place secondly in this in the other dram of shakespeare all the characters live think speak and act quite unconformably with the given time and place the action of king lear takes place 800 years and yet the characters are placed in conditions possible only in the middle ages participatin g in the drama are kings dukes armies and illegitimate children and gentlemen courtiers doctors farmers ofﬁcers soldiers and knights with vizors etc it is possible that such anachronisms with which shakespeare dramas abound did not injure the possibility of illusion in the sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth but in our time it is longer possible to follow with interest the development of events which one knows could not take place in the conditions which the author describes in detail the artiﬁciality of the positions not ﬂowing from the natural course of events or from the nature of the characters and their want of conformity with time and space is further increased by those coarse embellishments which are continually added by shakespeare and intended to appear particularly touching the extraordinary storm during which king lear roams about the heath or the grass which some reason he puts on his ophelia in hamlet edgar attire or the fool speeches or the appearance of the helmeted horseman these effects not only fail to enhance the impression but produce an opposite effect man sieht die absicht und man wird verstimmt goethe says it often happens that even during these obviously intentional efforts after effect instance the dragging out by the legs of half dozen corpses with which all shakespeare tragedies terminate instead of feeling fear and pity one is tempted rather to laugh footnotes from critical essay on shakespeare published in end of volume viii 255
