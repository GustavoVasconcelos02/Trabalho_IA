disappointments will be on the right side of the account we shall see more than we have anticipated rather than less and so our pleasures will it were come to us double i recall example the heightened interest with which i beheld my ﬁrst boston standing on the back of one of the seats in the garden steadying himself with oscillations of his tail conveniently long he peeped curiously down into geranium bed within the leafy seclusion of which he presently disappeared he was nothing but if i had seen him in the country i should have passed him by without second glance but here at the base of the everett statue he looked somehow like bird of another feather since then it is true i have learned that his occasional presence with us in the season of the migration is not matter astonishment at that time however i was happily more ignorant and therefore i say my pleasure was twofold pleasure that is of the bird society and of the surprise there are plenty of people i am aware who assert that there are longer any native birds in our city grounds at the most only few robins formerly things were different they have heard but now the abominable english sparrows monopolize every nook and corner these wise persons speak with an air of positiveness and doubtless ought to know whereof they afﬁrm hath not bostonian eyes and doth he not cross the common every day but it is proverbially hard to prove negative and some of us with thought of being cynical have ceased to put unqualiﬁed trust in other people eyesight since we have found our own to fall little short of absolute infallibility my own vision by the way is reasonably good if i may say so at any rate i am not yet here have i been perambulating the public garden an indeﬁnite period without seeing the ﬁrst trace of or shrew i should have been in excellent company had i begun long ago to maintain that such animals exist within our precincts but the other day butcher made us ﬂying call and almost the ﬁrst thing he did was to catch one of these same furry dainties and spit it upon thorn where anon i found him devouring it i would not appear to boast but really when i saw what collurio had done it did not so much occur to to quarrel with him because he had discovered in half an hour what i had overlooked ten years on the contrary i hastened to pay him lt compliment upon his indisputable sagacity and keenness natural historian measure of magnanimity easily enough afforded since however the shrike might excel at one point there could be question on the whole of my immeasurable superiority and i cherish the hope that my fellow townsmen who they insist never themselves see any birds whatever in the garden and common their attention being taken up with matters more important may be disposed to exercise similar forbearance toward when i modestly profess that within the last seven or eight years i have watched there some thousands of specimens representing not far from seventy species of course the principal part of all the birds to be found in such place are transient visitors merely in the long spring and autumn journeys it will all the time be happening that more or less of the travelers

one of the ﬁrst things to strike the observer is the uniformity with which such pilgrims arrive during the night he goes his rounds late in the afternoon and there is sign of anything unusual but the next morning the grounds are populous ﬁnches warblers and what not and they come in the dark so also they go away again with rare exceptions you may follow them up never so closely and they will nothing more than ﬂy from tree to tree or out of one clump of shrubbery into another once in great while under some special provocation they threaten longer ﬂight but on getting high enough to see the unbroken array of roofs on every side they speed ily grow confused and after few shiftings of their course dive hurriedly into the nearest tree it was mistake their stopping here in the ﬁrst place but once here there is nothing it save to put up with the discomforts of the situation till after sunset then please heaven they will be of f praying never to ﬁnd themselves again in such babel that most of our smaller birds migrate by night is by this time too well established to need corroboration but if the student wishes to assure himself of the fact at ﬁrst hand he may easily it by one or two

myself have often listening to the chips of warblers or the tseeps of sparrows these little wanderers hour after hour pass through the darkness over the city why the birds follow this plan what advantages they gain or what perils they avoid by making their ﬂight nocturnal is question with which our inquisitive friend will perhaps ﬁnd greater difﬁculty i should be glad one to hear his explanation rule our visitors tarry with us two or three days at least i have noticed that to be true in many cases where their numbers or size or rarity made it possible to be reasonably certain when the arrival and departure took place and in so very limited ﬁeld it is of course comparatively easy to keep track of the same individual during his stay and so to speak become acquainted with him i remember with interest several such acquaintanceships one of these was with woodpecker the ﬁrst i had ever seen he made his appearance one morning in october along with company of chickadees and other birds and at once took up his quarter s on near the ether monument i watched his movements some time and at noon happening to be in the same place again found him still there and there he remained four days i went to look at him several times daily and almost always found him either on the maple or on tulip tree few yards distant without question the sweetness of maple sap was known to sphyr opicus varius long before our human ancestors discovered it and this particular bird to judge from his actions must have been genuine connoisseur at all events he seemed to recognize our boston tree of sort not to be met with every day although to my less critical sense it was nothing but an ordinary specimen of the common acer dasycarpum he was extremely industrious is the custom of his family and paid attention to the children playing about or to the men who sat under his tree with the back of their seat resting against the trunk the children noise he likely enough enjoyed it he is noisy fellow himself and famous drummer an aged clergyman in washington told accents half pathetic half at certain time of the year he could scarcely read his bible on sunday mornings because of the racket which this woodpecker made hammering on the tin roof overhead another of my acquaintances was of very different type female maryland throat this lovely creature most exquisite dainty bit of bird ﬂesh was in the garden all by herself on the 6th of october when the great majority of her relatives must have been already well on their way toward the sunny south she appeared to be perfectly contented

fowls of the air passenger even worse belated than this warbler was chipping sparrow that i found hopping about the edge of the beacon street mall on the 6th of december seven or eight weeks after all chippers were supposed to be south of mason and dixon line some accident had detained him doubtless but he showed signs of worry or haste i walked round him scrutinizing every feather lest he should be some tree sparrow traveling in disguise there is not much to attract birds to the common in the winter since we offer them neither evergreens shelter nor weed patches granary i said to one of the gardeners that i thought it pity on this account that some of the plants especially the zinnias and marigolds were not left to go to seed little untidiness in so good cause could hardly be taken amiss by even the most fastidious taxpayer he replied that it would be of use we had any birds now and we should have any so long the english sparrows were here to drive them away but it would be of use notwithstanding and certainly it would afford pleasure to many people to see ﬂocks of goldﬁn ches poll linnets tree sparrows and possibly of the beautiful snow buntings feeding in the garden in midwinter even things are however the cold season is sure to bring us few butcher these come on business and are now welcomed public benefactors though formerly our municipal authorities thought it their duty to shoot them they travel singly rule and sometimes the same bird will be here several weeks together then you will have trouble about ﬁnding here and there in the hawthorn trees pleasing evidences of his activity and address collurio is brought up to be in love with his work in his mother goose it is written and however long he may live he never forgets his early training his days the poet says are bound each to each by natural piety happy lot wherein duty and conscience go ever hand in hand whose possessor in appearance the shrike resembles the indeed policeman whom i found staring at one would have it that he was you see he is and he been singing too i had nothing to say against the singing since the shrike will often twitter by the half hour in the very coldest weather but further discussion conce rning the bird identity was soon rendered needless while we were talking along came sparrow and dropped carelessly into hawthorn bush right under the shrike perch the latter was all attention instantly and after waiting till the sparrow had moved little out of the thick of the branches down he pounced he missed his aim or the sparrow was too quick him and although he made second swoop and followed that by hot chase he speedily came back without his prey this little exertion however seemed to have provoked his appetite instead of resuming his perch he went into the hawthorn and began to feed upon the carcass of bird which it seemed he had previously laid up in store he was soon frightened off few momen ts by the approach of third man and the police man improved the opportunity to visit the bush and bring away his breakfast when the fellow returned and found his table empty he did not manifest the slightest disappointment the shrike never does he is fatalist i think but in order to see what he would the policeman tossed the body to him it lodged on one of the outer twigs and immediately the shrike came it at the same time spread ing his beautifully bordered tail and screaming loudly whether these demonstrations were pg 10 pg 1 1 fe ﬁ fo farrow i smell the blood of an english sparrow love is an unerring light and joy its own security pg 12 pg 13 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https to express delight or anger or contempt i could not judge but he seized the body carried it back to its old place drove it again upon the thorn and proceeded to devour it more voraciously than ever scattering the feathers about in lively way he tore it to pieces the third man who had never before seen such thing stepped up within reach of the bush and eyed the performance at his leisure the shrike not deigning to mind him in the least few mornings later the same bird gave another and more amusing exhibition of his nonchalance he was singing from the top of our one small and i had stopped near the bridge to look and listen when milkma n entered at the commonwealth avenue gate both hands full of cans and without noticing the shrike walked straight under the tree just then however he heard the notes overhead and looking up saw the bird if not knowing what to make of the creature assurance he stared at him moment and then putting down his load he seized the trunk with both hands and gave it good shake but the bird only took fresh hold and when the man let go and stepped back to look up there he sat to all appearance unconcerned if nothing had happened not to be so easily beaten the man grasped the trunk again and shook it harder than before and this time collurio seemed to think the joke had been carried far enough he took wing and ﬂew to another part of the garden the bravado of the butcher is great but it is not unlimited i saw him one day shufﬂin g along branch in very nervous unshrikely fashion and was at loss to account his unusual demeanor till i caught sight of ing hawk sweeping over the tree every creature matter how brave has some other creature to be afraid of otherwise how would the world get on the advent of spring is usually announced during the ﬁrst week of march sometimes by the robins sometimes by the bluebirds the latter it should be remarked are an exception to the rule that our spring and autumn callers arrive and depart in the night my impression is that their migrations are ordinarily accomplished by daylight at all events i have often seen them enter the common alight few minutes and then start off again while i have never known them to settle down visit of two or three days in the manner of most other species this last peculiarity may be owing to the fact that the european sparrows treat them with even more than their customary measure of incivility till the poor wayfarers have literally rest the soles of their feet they breed by choice in just such miniature our city fathers have provided so plentifully their foreign protégés and probably the latter being aware of this feel it necessary to discourage at the outset any idea which these american interlopers may have begun to entertain of settling in boston the summer the robins may be said to be abundant with us more than half the year but they are especially numerous month or two early in the season i have counted more than thirty feeding at once in the lower half of the parade ground and at nightfall have seen forty at roost in one tree with half many more in the tree adjoining they grow extremely noisy about sunset ﬁlling the air with songs cackles and screams till even the most stolid citizen pauses moment to look up at the authors of so much clamor by the middle of march the song sparrows begin to appear and month after this they furnish delightful music daily i have heard them caroling with all cheerfulness in the midst of driving the dear little optimists they never doubt that the sun is on their side of necessity they go elsewh ere to ﬁnd nests themselves where they may lay their young they build on the ground and lawn which is mowed every two or three days would be quite out of the question at the best public park is not favorable spot in which to study bird music species that spend the summer here like the robin the warbling vireo the vireo the chipper the goldﬁnch and the baltimore oriole of course sing freely but the much larger number which merely drop in upon us by the way are busy feeding during their brief sojourn and besides are kept in state of greater or less excitement by the frequent approach of nevertheless i once heard bobolink sing in our garden the only one i ever saw there and once brown thrush although neither was sufﬁciently at home to himself justice the peabody song of the sparrow s is to be pg 14 pg 15 pg 16 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https occasionally during both migrations it is the more welcome in such place because to my ears at least it is one of the wildest of all bird notes it is among the last to be heard at night in the white mountain woods well one of the last to die away beneath you you climb the higher peaks on the crawford bridle path instance i remember that the song of this bird and that of the thrush 1 were heard all along the ridge from mount clinton to mount washington the ﬁnest bird concert i ever attended in boston was given on monument hill by great chorus of sparrows one morning in april high wind had been blowing during the night and the moment i entered the common i discovered that there had been an extraordinary arrival of birds of various species the parade ground was full of while the hill was covered with of them i thought and many of them in full song it was royal concert but the audience i am sorry to say was small it is unfor tunate in some aspects of the case that birds have never learned that matinée ought to begin at two in the afternoon these sparrows please by their lordly treatment of their european cousins one in particular who was holding his ground against three of the britishers moved almost to the point of giving him three cheers of late few crow blackbirds have taken to building their nests in one corner of our domain and they attract at least their full share of attention they strut about the lawns in their glossy clerical suits one of the gardeners tells that they sometime s kill the sparrows i hope they the crow blackbird attempts at song are ludicrous in the extreme every note is cracked and is accompanied by ridiculous caudal gesture but he is ranked among the oscines and seems to know it and after all it is only the common fault of singers not to be able to detect their own want of tunefulness i was once crossing the common in the middle of the day when i was suddenly arrested by the call of cuckoo at the same instant two men passed and i heard one say to the other hear that cuckoo you know what it means well i know what it means it means that it going to rain it did rain although not number of days i believe but probably the cuckoo has adopted the modern method of predicting the weather some time in advance not very long afterwards i again heard this same note on the common but it was several years before i was able to put the cuckoo into my boston list bird actually seen indeed it is not so very easy to see him anywhere he makes practice of robbing the nests of smaller birds and is always skulking about from one tree to another though he were afraid of being discovered doubt he is what wordsworth wrote of the european species allowance being made proper degree of poetic license is equally applicable to ours when i did ﬁnally get sight of the fellow it was on this wise i entered the garden one morning in september goldﬁnch was calling so persistently and with such anxious emphasis from the large sophora tree that i turned my steps that way to ascertain what could be the trouble i took the voice young bird but found instead male adult who was twitching his tail nervously and scolding at cuckoo perched near at hand in his usual sneaking attitude the goldﬁnch called and called till my patience was nearly spent small birds know better than to attack big one so long the latter is at rest then at last the cuckoo started off the ﬁnch after him and few minutes later i saw the same ﬂight and chase repeated seve ral other goldﬁnches were ﬂying about in the neighborhood but only this one was in the least excited doubt less he had special reasons of his own dreading the presence of this cowardly foe one of our regular visitors twice year is the brown creeper he is so small and silent and withal his color is so like that of the bark to which he clings that i suspect he is seldom noticed even by persons who pass within few feet of him but he is not too pg 17 pg 18 pg 19 bird but an invisible thing voice mystery pg 20 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https to be hectored by the sparrows and i have before now been amused at the encounter the sparrow catches sight of the creeper and at once bears down upon him when the creeper darts to the other side of the tree and alights again little further up the sparrow is after him but he comes dashing round the trunk he always seems to expect to ﬁnd the creeper perched upon some twig any other bird would be and it is only after little reconnoitring that he again discovers him clinging to the vertical bole then he makes another onset with similar result and these manoeœuvres are repeated till the creeper becomes disgusted and takes to another tree the thrushes and the hermits may be looked every spring and autumn and i have known forty or ﬁfty of the former to be present at once the hermits most often travel singly or in pairs though small ﬂock is not so very uncomm on both species preserve absolute silence while here i have watched hundreds of them without hearing so much an alarm note they are far from being pugnacious but their sense of personal dignity is large and once in while when the sparrows pester them beyond endurance they assume the offensive with much spirit there are none of our feathered guests whom i am gladder to see the sight of them inevitably ﬁlls with remembrances of happy vacation seasons among the hills of new hampshire if only they would sing on the common they in those northern woods the whole city would come out to hear them during every migration large numbers of warblers visit us i have noted the crowned thrush the water the creeper the maryland the blue the green the blue the the summer the the canada ﬂycatcher and the redstart doubt the list is far from complete of course i have not used either glass or gun and without one or other of these aids the observer must be content to let many of these small birds pass unidentiﬁed the two kinglets give us call occasionally and in the late summer and early autumn the birds spend several weeks about our ﬂower it would be hard the latter to ﬁnd more agreeable in the whole course of their southward journey what could they ask better than beds of tuberoses japanese lilies nicotiana against the use of which they manifest not the slightest scruple petunias and the like having in mind the duke of argyll assertion that bird can ever ﬂy backwards 2 i have more than once watched these at their work on purpose to see whether they would respect the noble scotchman dictum i am compelled to report that they appeared never to have heard of his theory at any rate they very plainly did ﬂy tail foremost and that not only in dropping from blossom which case the seeming ﬂight might have been the duke maintains an optical illusion merely even while backing out of the ﬂower in an upward direction they are commendably catholic in their tastes i saw one exploring the disk of sunﬂower in company with splendid monarch butte rﬂy possibly he knew that the sunﬂower was just then in fashion only few minutes earlier the same another like chased an english sparrow out of the garden across arlington street and up to the very roof of house to the great delight of at least one patriotic yankee at another time i saw one of these tiny beauties making his morning toilet in very pretty fashion leaning forward and brushing ﬁrst one cheek and then the other against the wet rose leaf on which he was perched the only swallows on my list are the barn swallows and the the former they go hawking about the crowded streets must often send the thoughts of rich city merchants back to the big barns of their grandfathers far off in country places of course we have the chimney swifts also near relatives of the birds but they are not swallows speaking of the swallows i am reminded of hawk that came to boston one morning fully determined not to go away without taste of the famous imported sparrows it is nothing unusual hawks to be seen ﬂying over the city but i had never before known pg 21 pg 22 pg 23 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https actually to make the public garden his this bird perched while on the arlington street fence within few feet of passing carriage next he was on the ground peering into bed of rhododendrons then long time he sat still in tree while numbers of men walked back and forth underneath between whiles he sailed about on the watch his prey on one of these last occasions little company of swallows came along and one of them immediately went out of his way to swoop down upon the hawk and deal him dab then he rejoined his companions i heard him give little chuckle though he said there did you see peck at him you think i am afraid of such fellow that you to speak in thoreau manner i rejoiced in the incident fresh illustration of the ascendency of spirit over matter one is always glad to ﬁnd familiar bird playing new rôle and especially in such spot the common where at the best one can hope to see so very little it may be assumed therefore that i felt peculiarly grateful to nuthatch when i discovered him bopping about on the monument hill piece of humility such i had never before detected any nuthatch in the practice of indeed this fellow looked so unlike himself moving brisk ly through the grass with long awkward leaps that at ﬁrst sight i failed to recognize him he was occupied with turning over the dry leaves one after another cocoons or things of that sort i suppose twice he found what he was in search of but instead of handling the leaf on the ground he ﬂew with it to the trunk of an elm wedged it into crevice of the bark and proceeded to hammer it sharply with his beak great is the power of habit it not any bird should ﬁnd it easiest to such work while clinging to perpendicula r surface yes but how does it look to dog i wonder that men can walk better on their hind legs than on all fours everything is mirac le from somebody point of view the sparrows were inclined to make game of my obliging little performer but he would have none of their insolence and repelled every appro ach in dashing style in exactly three weeks from this time and on the same hillside i came upon another nuthatch similarly employed but before this one had turned up leaf to his mind the sparrows became literally too many him and he took ﬂight my small disappointment it would be unfair not to name others of my city guests even though i have nothing in particular to record concerning them the wilson thrush and the nuthatch i have seen once or twice each the chew ink is more constant in his visits is also the woodpecker our famili ar little downy woodpecker on the other hand has thus far kept out of my catalogue other bird absence has surprised so much and it is the more remarkable because the comparatively rare species is to be met with nearly every season cedar show themselves irregularly one march morning when the ground was covered with snow ﬂock of perhaps hundred collected in one of the taller maples in the garden till the tree looked from distanc like an autumn hickory its leaﬂess branches still thickly dotted with nuts four days afterward what seemed to be the same company made their appearance in the common of the ﬂycatchers i have noted the kingbird the least ﬂycatcher and the phœbe the two former stay to breed twice in the fall i have found kingﬁsher about the frog pond once the fellow sprung his watchman rattle he was perhaps my most unexpected caller and minute or so i was not entirely sure whether indeed i was in boston or not the blue jay and the crow know too much to be caught in such place although one may often enough see the latter passing overhead every now and then in the traveling season stray sandpiper or two will be observed teetering round the edge of the mon and garden ponds and one day when the latter was drained i saw quite ﬂock of some one of the smaller species feeding over its bottom very picturesque they were feeding and ﬂying in close order besides these must be mentioned the vireo the winged bunting the swamp sparrow the ﬁeld sparrow the purple ﬁnch the linnet the savanna sparrow the tree sparrow the whose celebrated tumbling trick may often be witnessed by evening strollers in the garden the woodcock i found the body of one which had evidently met its death against the electric wire and among the best of all the chickadees who sometimes make the whole autumn cheerful with pg 24 pg 25 pg 26 pg 27 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https presence but about whom i say nothing here because i have said so much elsewhere of fugitive i recall only in the garden one of these feeding tamely in the path i suspected an english robin but he was not in full plumage and my conjecture may have been incorrect another was diminutive ﬁnch dressed in suit of red blue and green he sat in bush saying to feline admirer who was making love to him earnestly the others were cardinal grosbeak and paroquet the and the grosbeak might possibly have been wild had the question been one of latitude simply but their demeanor satisﬁed to the contrary the former awkward attempt at alighting on the tip of seemed evidence enough that he had not been long at large the paroquet was splendid creature with brilliant orange throat darkly spotted he ﬂew from tree to tree chattering gayly and had really pretty song evidently he was in the best of spirits notwithstanding the rather obtrusive attentions of crowd of house sparrows who appeared to look upon such wearer of the green badly out of place in this new england of theirs but all his vivacity i feared he would not be long in coming to grief if he escaped other perils the cold weather must soon overtake him it was now the middle of september and his last state would be worse than his ﬁrst he had better have kept his cage unless indeed he was one of the nobler spirits that prefer death to slavery of all the birds thus far named very few seemed to attract the attention of anybody except myself but there remains one other whom i have reserved the last not because he was in himself the noblest or the most interesting though he was perhaps the biggest but because unlike the rest he did succeed in winning the notice of the multitude in fact my one owl to speak theatrically made decided hit single afternoon he may be said to have been famous at all events notorious if any fashioned reader be disposed to insist upon this all but obsolete distinction his triumph such it was had already begun when i ﬁrst discovered him he was then perched well up in an elm while mob of perhaps forty men and boys were pelting him with sticks and stones even in the dim light of cloudy november afternoon he seemed quite bewildered and helpless making attempt to escape although the missiles were ﬂying past him on all sides the most he did was to shift his perch when he was hit which to be sure happened pretty often once he was struck so hard that he came tumbling toward the ground and i began to think it was all over with him but when about down he recovered himself and by dint of painful ﬂappings succeeded in alighting just out of the reach of the crowd at once there were loud cries kill him kill him and while the scamps were debating what to next he regained his breath and ﬂew up into the tree again high before then the stoning began anew my part i pitied the fellow sincerely and wished him well out of the hands of his tormentors but i found myself laughing with the rest to see him turn his head and stare with his big vacant eyes after stone which had just whizzed by his ear everybody that came along stopped few minutes to witness the sport and beacon street ﬁlled up with carriages till it looked if some holiday procession were halted in front of the state house i left the crowd still at their work and must them the justice to say that some of them were excellent marksmen an old negro who stood near was bewailing the law against shooting else he said he would go home and get his gun he described with appropriate gestures how very easily he could fetch the bird down perhaps he afterwards plucked up courage to violate the statute at any rate the next morning newspapers reported that an owl had been shot the day

leaﬂess tree there he sits facing the sun like genuine worshiper and singing though he would pour out his very soul what is he thinking about what spirit possesses him it is easy to ask questions until the simplest matter comes to seem what at bottom it really is thing altogether mysterious but if our robin could understand us he would likely enough reply why you talk in this way if it were something requiring explanation that bird should sing you seem to have forgotten that everybody sings or almost everybody think of the insects bees and the crickets and the locusts to say nothing of your intimate friends the mosquitoes think too of the frogs and the hylas if these blooded creatures after sleeping all winter in the mud 3 are free to make so much use of their voices surely bird of

darwinism need not frighten us it will us harm to remember now and then the hole of the pit whence we were digged and besides far any relationship between us and the birds is concerned it is doubtful whether we are the party to complain but avoiding genealogies and contentions and taking up the question with which we began we may safely say that birds sing sometimes to gratify an innate love sweet sounds sometimes to win mate or to tell their love to mate already won sometimes practice with view to and sometimes better reason than the poet i but sing because i must in general they sing joy and their joy of course has various causes one thing they are very sensitive to the weather with them with us sunlight and genial warmth go to produce serenity bright summer day late in october or even in november will set the smaller birds to singing and the grouse to drumming i heard robin venturing little song on the 25th of last december but that aught i know was christmas carol matter what the season you will not hear great deal of bird music during high wind and if you are caught in the woods by sudden shower in may or june and are not too much taken up with thoughts of your own condition

freely when the sky is overcast but their highest joys are by means dependent upon the moods of the weather comfortable state of mind is not to be contemned but beings who are capable of deep and passionate affection recognize difference between comfort and ecstasy and the peculiar glory of birds is just here in the fervor of their love it would be commonplace to call them models of conjugal and parental faithfulness with few exceptions and these it is pleasure to add not singers the very least of them is literally faithful unto death here and there in the notes of some collector we are told of difﬁculty he has had in securing coveted specimen the tiny creature whose mate had been already collected would persist in hovering so closely about the invad er head that it was impossible to shoot him without spoiling him the cabinet by blowing him to pieces need there be any mystery about the singing of such lover is it surprising if at times he is so enraptured that he can longer sit tamely on the branch but must dart into the air and go circling round and round caroling he ﬂies so far song is the voice of emotion it will of necessity vary with the emotion and every one who has ears must have heard once in while bird music of quite unusual fervor example i have often seen the least ﬂycatcher very body surely when he was almost beside himself ﬂying in circle and repeating breathlessly his emphatic chebec and once i found wood pewee in somewhat similar mood he was more quiet than the least ﬂycatcher but he too sang on the wing and i have never heard notes which seemed more expressive of happiness many of them were entirely new and strange although the familiar pewee was introduced among the rest i listened i felt it to be an occasion thankfulness that the delighted creature had never studied anatomy and did not know that the structure of his throat made it improper him to sing in this connection also i recall cardinal grosbeak whom i heard several years ago on the bank of the potomac river an old soldier had taken to visit the great falls and we were clambering over the rocks this grosbeak began to sing and soon without any hint from and without knowing who the invisible musician was my companion remarked upon the unco mmon beauty of the song the cardinal is always great singer having voice which european writers say is almost equal to the nightingale but in this case the more stirring martial quality of the strain had given place to an exquisite mellowness if it were what i have doubt it was song of love every kind of bird has notes of its own so that thoroughly practiced ear would be able to discriminate the different species with nearly much certainty profes sor baird would feel after an examination of the anatomy and plumage still this strong speciﬁc resemblance is far from being dead uniformity aside from the fact already mentioned that the characteristic strain is sometimes given with extraordinary sweetness and emphasis there are often to be detected variations of more formal character this is noticeably true of robins it may almost be said that two of them sing alike while now and then their vagaries are conspicuous enough to attract general attention one who was my neighbor last year interjected into his song series of four or ﬁve most exact imitations of the peep of chicken when i ﬁrst heard this performance i was in company with two friends both of whom noticed and laughed at it and some days afterwards i visited the spot again and found the bird still rehearsing the same ridiculous medley i conjectured that he had been brought up near and moreover had been so unfortunate to lose his fathe r before his notes had become thoroughly ﬁxed and then being compelled to ﬁnish his musical education by himself had taken fancy to practice these chicken calls this guess may not have been correct all i can afﬁrm is that he sang exactly he might have been expected to on that supposition but certainly the resemblance seemed too close to be accidental pg 36 pg 37 pg 38 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https variations of the wood thrush are fully striking those of the robin and sometimes it is impossible not to feel that the artist is making deliberate effort to something out of the ordinary course something better than he has ever done before now and then he prefaces his proper song with many disconnected extremely staccato notes following each other at very distant and unexpected intervals of pitch it is this i conclude which is meant by some writer who it is i can not now remember when he criticises the wood thrush spending too much time in tuning his instrument but the fault is the critic i think to my ear these preliminaries sound rather like the recitative which goes before the grand aria still another musician who delights to take liberties with his score is the towhee bunting or chewink indeed he carries the matter so far that sometimes it seems almost if he suspected the proximity of some ornithologist and were determined if possible to make fool of him and my part being neither self conceited nor an ornithologist i am willing to confess that i have once or twice been so badly deceived that now the mere sight of this pipilo is so to speak means of grace to one more of these innovators these heretics they are most likely called by their more conservative brethren is the ﬁeld sparrow better known spizella pusilla his usual song consists of simple line of notes beginning leisurely but growing shorter and more rapid to the close the voice is so smooth and sweet and the acceleration so well managed that although the whole is commonly strict monotone the effect is not in the least monotonous this song i once heard rendered in reverse order with result so strange that i did not suspect the identity of the author till i had crept up within sight of him another of these sparrows who has passed the last two seasons in my neighborhood habitually doubles the measure going through it in the usual way and then just you expect him to conclude catching it up again capo but birds like these are quite outdone by such species the song sparrow the vireo and the western of which we may say that each individual bird has whole repertory of songs at his command the song sparrow who is the best known of the three will repeat one melody perhaps dozen times then change it second and in turn leave that third if he were singing hymns of twelve or ﬁfteen stanzas each and set each hymn to its appropriate tune it is something well worth listen ing to common though it is and may easily suggest number of questions about the origin and meaning of bird music the vireo is singer of astonishing spirit and his sudden changes from one theme to another are sometimes almost startling he is skillful ventriloquist also and i remember one in particular who outwitted completely he was rehearsing known strain but at the end there came up from the bushes underneath querulous call at ﬁrst i took it granted that some other bird was in the underbrush but the note was repeated too many times and came in too exactly on the beat i have personal acquaintance with the western but less than six of his songs have been printed in musical notation and these are said to be by means all 4 others of our birds have similar gifts though others so far i know are quite so versatile these three several of the warblers example have attained to more than one set song notwithstanding the deserv edly small reputation of this misnamed family i have myself heard the thrush the green warbler the blue the and the sing two melodies each while the blue has at least three and this of course without making anything of slight variations such all birds are more or less accustomed to indulge in the best of the three songs of the blue i have never heard except on one occasion but then it was repeated half an hour under my very eyes it bore resemblance to the common dsee dsee dsee of the species and would appear to be seldom used not only have i never heard it since but none of the writers seem ever to pg 39 pg 40 pg 41 pg 42 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https heard it at all however i still keep careful description of it which i took down on the spot and which i expect some future to verify but the most celebrated of the warblers in this regard is the thrush otherwise called the and the wood wagtail his ordinary effort is one of the noisiest least melodious and most incessant sounds to be heard in our woods his song is another matter that he takes to the air usually starting from although i have seen him rise from the ground whence after preliminary chip chip he lets fall hurried ﬂood of notes in the midst of which can usually be distinguished his familiar weechee weechee weechee it is nothing wonderful that he should sing on the wing many other birds the same and very much better than he but he is singular in that he strictly reserves his aerial music late in the afternoon i have heard it early three but never before that and it is most common about sunset writers speak of it limited to the season of courtship but i have heard it almost daily till near the end of july and once my special beneﬁt perhaps it was given in the ﬁrst day of september but who taught the little creature to this sing one song in the forenoon perched upon twig and to keep another afternoon singing that invariably on the wing and what difference is there between the two in the mind of the singer 5 it is an indiscretion ever to say of bird that he has only such and such notes you may have been his friend years but the next time you go into the woods he will likely enough put you to shame by singing something not so much hinted at in your description i thought i knew the song of the warbler having listened to it many times slight and rather characterless thing nowise remarkable but coming down mount willard one day in june i heard warbler song which brought to sudden halt it was new and beautiful beautiful it seemed at the moment than any warbler song i had ever heard what could it be little patient waiting while the and mosquitoes came upon to eat up my ﬂesh and the wonderful stranger appeared in full view old acquaintance the warbler with all this strong tendency on the part of birds to vary their music how is it that there is still such degree of uniformity so that we have said every species may be recognized by its notes why does every vireo sing in one way and every vireo in another who teaches the young chipper to trill and the young linnet to warble in short how birds come by their music is it all matter of instinct inherited habit or they learn it the answer appears to be that birds sing children talk by simple imitation nobody imagi nes that the infant is born with language printed upon his brain the father and mother may never have known word of any tongue except the english but if the child is brought up to hear only chinese he will infallibly speak that and nothing else and careful experiments have shown the same to be true of birds 6 taken from the nest just after they leave the shell they invariably sing not their own natural song but the song of their foster provided of course that this is not anything beyond their physical capacity the notorious house sparrow our english sparrow in his wild or state never makes music al sound but if he is taken in hand early enough he may be taught to sing so it is said nearly well the canary bechstein relates that paris clergyman had two of these sparrows whom he had trained to speak and among other things to recite several of the shorter commandments and the narrative goes on to say that it was sometimes very comical when the pair were disputing over their food to hear one gravely admonish the other thou shalt not steal it would be interesting to know why creatures thus gifted not sing of their own motion with their amiability and sweet peaceableness they ought to be caroling the whole year round this question of the transmission of songs from one generation to another is of course part of the general subject of animal intelligence subject much discussed in these days on account of its bearing upon the mode rn doctrine concerning the relation of man to the inferior orders pg 43 pg 44 pg 45 pg 46 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https have nothing to with such theme but it may not be out of place to suggest to preachers and moralists that here is striking and unhackneyed illustration of the force of early training birds sing by imitation it is true but rule they imitate only the notes which they hear during the ﬁrst few weeks after they are hatched one of barrington linnets example after being educated under titlark was put into room with two birds of his own species where he heard them sing freely every day three months he made attempt to learn anything from them however but kept on practicing what the titlark had taught him quite unconscious of anything singular or unpatriotic in such course this law that impressions received during the immaturity of the powers become the unalterable habit of the after life is perhaps the most momentous of all the laws in whose power we ﬁnd ourselves sometimes we are tempted to call it cruel but if it were annulled this would be strange world what we should have among the birds there would be more telling them by their notes thrushes and jays wrens and chickadees ﬁnches and warblers all would be singing one grand medley between these two opposing tendencies one urging to variation the other to permanence nature herself is half radical half conservative the language of birds has grown from rude beginnings to its present beautiful diversity and whoever lives century of millenniums hence will listen to music such we in this day can only dream of inappreciably but ceaselessly the work goes on here and there is born master feathered genius and every generation makes its own addition to the glorious inheritance it may be doubted whether there is any real connection between moral character and the possession of wings nevertheless there has long been popular feeling that some such congruity does exist and certainly it seems unreasonable to suppose that creatures who are able to soar at will into the heavens should be without other equally angelic attributes but be that it may our friends the birds undeniably set us good example in several respects to mention only one how becoming is their observance of morning and evening song in spite of their industrious spirit and few of us labor more hours daily neither their ﬁrst nor their last thoughts are given to the question what shall we eat and what shall we drink possibly their habit of saluting the rising and setting sun may be thought to favor the theory that the worship of the god of day was the original religion i know nothing about that but it would be sad change if the birds declining from their present beautiful custom were to sleep and work work and sleep with holy hour between is too much the case with the being who according to his own pharisaic notion is the only religious animal in the season however the woods are by means silent even at noonday many species such the vireos and warblers who get their living amid the foliage of trees sing they work while the thrushes and others who keep business and pleasure more distinct are often too happy to go many hours together without hymn i have even seen robins singing without quitting the turf but that is rather unusual somehow birds have come to feel that they must get away from the ground when the lyrical mood is upon them this may be thing of sentiment is not language full of uncomplimentary allusions to earth and earthliness but more likely it is prudential the gift of song is doubt dangerous blessing to creatures who have so many enemies and we can readily believe that they have found it safer to be up where they can look about them while thus publishing their whereabouts very interesting exception to this rule is the savanna sparrow who sings habitually from the ground but even he shares the common feeling and stretches himself to his full height with an earnestness which is almost laughable in view of the result his notes are hardly louder than cricket chirp probably he has fallen into this lowly habit from living in meadows and salt marshes where bushes and trees are not readily to be come at and it is worth noticing that in the case of the skylark and the blackbird the same conditions have led to result precisely opposite the sparrow we may presume was originally of humble disposition and when nothing better offered itself easily grew accustomed to standing upon stone or little lump of pg 47 pg 48 pg 49 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https and this practice long persisted in naturally had the effect to lessen the loudness of his voice the skylark on the other hand when he did not readily ﬁnd said to himself never mind i have pair of wings and so the lark is famous while the sparrow remains un and is even mistaken grasshopper how true it is that the very things which dishearten one nature and break it down only help another to ﬁnd out what it was made if you would foretell the development either of bird or of man it is not enough to know his environment you must know also what there is in him we have possibly made too much of the savanna sparrow innocent eccentricity he ﬁlls his place and ﬁlls it well and who knows but that he may yet outshine the skylark there is promise i believe those who humble themselves but what shall be said of species which not even try to sing and that notwithstanding they have all the structural peculiarities of singing birds and must almost certainly have come from ancestors who were singers we have already mentioned the house sparrow whose defect is the more mysterious on account of his belonging to so highly musical family but he was never accused of not being noisy enough while we have one bird who though he is classed with the oscines passes his life in almost unbroken silence of course i refer to the waxwing or cedar whose faint sibilant whisper can scarcely be thought to contradict the foregoing description by what strange freak he has lapsed into this ghostly habit nobody knows i make account of the insinuation that he gave up music because it hindered his success in he likes cherries it is true and who can blame him but he would need to work hard to steal more than does that indefatigable songster the robin i feel sure he has some better reason than this his quakerish conduct but however he came by his stillness it is likely that by this time he plumes himself upon it silence is golden he thinks the supreme result of the highest æsthetic culture those loud creatures the thrushes and ﬁnches what vulga r set they are to be sure the more the pity certainly if he does not reason in some such way bird nature is not so human we have given it credit being besides the waxwi ng has an uncommon appreciation of the decorous at least we must think so if we are able to credit story of nuttall he declares that boston gentleman whose name he gives saw one of company of these birds capture an insect and offer it to his neighbor he however delicately declined the dainty bit and it was offered to the next who in turn was equally polite and the morsel actually passed back and forth along the line till ﬁnally one of the ﬂock was persuaded to eat it i have never seen anything equal to this but one day happening to stop under low cedar i discovered right over my head waxwing nest with the mother sitting upon it while her mate was perched beside her on the branch he was barely out of my reach but he did not move muscle and although he uttered sound his behavior said plainly possible what you expect to here you see i am standing guard over this nest i should be ashamed not to be able to add that i respected his dignity and courage and left him and his castle unmolested observations so discursive these can hardly be ﬁnished they must break off abruptly or else go on forever let us make an end therefore with expressing our hope that the cedar already so handsome and chivalrous will yet take to himself song one sweet and original worthy to go with his soft satin coat his ornaments of and his magniﬁcent let him that and he shall always be made welcome yes even though he come in force and in f t n t s there is society among the birds and the robin is not aware that his own remote ancestors

than intruders not the woods belong to those who live in them while nobody remembers the meteorologist who nevertheless smiles in his sleeve at all these notions and says to himself that he knows the truth of the matter so is it with everything and with all the rest so is it with the birds the interest they excite is of all grades from that which looks upon them items of millinery up to that of the makers of ornithological systems who ransack the world specimens and who have doubt that the chief end of bird is to be named and catalogued more synonyms the better somewhere between these two extremes comes the person whose interest in birds is friendly rather than scientiﬁc who has little taste shooting and an aversion from dissecting who delights in the living creatures themselves and counts bird in the bush worth two in the hand such person if he is intelligent makes good use of the best works on ornithology he would not know how to get along without them but he studies most the birds themselves and after while he begins to associate them on plan of his own not that he distrust s the approximate correctness of the received classiﬁcation or ceases to ﬁnd it of daily service

of grouping our friends according to height or complexion or any other physical peculiarity but it is not proposed in this paper to attempt new classiﬁcation of any sort even the most unscientiﬁc and fanciful all i am to is to set down at random few studies in such method i have indicated in short few studies in the temperaments of birds nor in making this attempt am i unmindful how elusive of analysis traits of character are and how diverse is the impression which the same personality produces upon different observers in matters of this kind every judgment is largely question of emphasis and proportion and moreover what we ﬁnd in our friends depends in great part on what we have in ourselves this i not forget and therefore i foresee that others will discover in the birds of whom i write many things that i miss and perhaps will miss some things which i have treated patent or even conspicuous it remains only each to testify what he has seen and at the end to confess that soul even the soul of bird is after all mystery let our ﬁrst example then be the common titmouse or chickadee he is par excellence the bird of the merry heart there is notion current to be sure that all birds are merry but that is one of those opinions which man who begins to observe himself soon ﬁnds it necessary to give up with many birds life is hard struggle enemies are numerous and the food supply is too often scanty of some species it is probable that very few die in their beds but the chickadee seems to be exempt from all forebodings his coat is thick his heart is brave and whatever may happen something will be found to eat take thought the morrow is his creed which he accepts not substance of doctrine but literally matter how bitter the wind or how deep the snow you will never ﬁnd the chickadee the saying is under the weather it is this perennial good humor i suppose which makes other birds so fond of his companionship and their example might well be heeded by persons who suffer from ﬁts of depression such unfortunates could hardly better than to court the society of the joyous tit his whistles and chirps his graceful feats of climbing and hanging and withal his engaging familiarity of course such his could not consist with suspiciousness would most likely send them home in more christian mood the time will come we may hope when doctors will prescribe instead of to illustrate the chickadee trustfulness i may mention that friend of mine captured one in and carrying him into the house let him loose in the the little stranger was at home immediately and seeing the window full of plants proceeded to go over them carefully picking off the lice with which such gardens are always more or less infested little later he was taken into my friend lap and soon he climbed up to his shoulder where after hopping about few minutes on his he selected comfortable roosting place tucked his head under his wing and went to sleep and slept on undist urbed while carried from one room to another probably the chickadee nature is not of the deepest i have never seen him when his joy rose to ecstasy still his feelings are not shallow and the faithfulness of the pair to each other and to their offspring is of the highest order the female has sometimes to be taken off the nest and even to be held in the hand before the eggs can be examined our american goldﬁnch is one of the loveliest of birds with his elegant plumage his rhythmical undulatory ﬂight his beautiful song and his more beautiful soul he ought to be one of the best beloved if not one of the most famous but he has never yet had half his deserts he is like the chickadee and yet different he is not so extremely conﬁding nor should i call him merry but he is always cheerful in spite of his plaintive note from which he gets one of his names and always amiable so far i know he never utters harsh sound even the young ones asking food use only smooth musical tones during the pairing season his delight often becomes rapturous to see him then hovering and singing better still to see the devoted pair hovering together billing and singing enough to even cynic good the happy lovers they have never read it in book but it is written on their hearts pg 58 pg 59 pg 60 pg 61 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https goldﬁnch has the advantage of the titmouse in several respects but he lacks that sprightliness that exceeding which is the chickadee most endearing characteristic the sake of strong contrast we may look next at the brown thrush known to farmers the and to ornithologists harpor hynchus rufus staid and solemn puritan whose creed is the preacher v anity of vanities all is vanity frivolity and him after his brief annual period of intensely passionate song he does penance the remainder of the year about on the ground or near it silent and gloomy he seems ever on the watch against an enemy and unfortunately his comfort he has nothing of the reckless bandit spirit such the jay possesses which goes to make moderate degree of danger almost pastime not that he is without courage when his nest is in question he will take great risks but in general his manner is dispirited sicklied with the pale cast of thought evidently he feels and it would not be surprising if he sometimes raised the question is life worth living it is the worst feature of his case that his melancholy is not of the sort which softens and reﬁnes the nature there is suggestion of saintliness about it in fact i am convinced that this thrush has constitutional taint of vulgarity his stealthy underhand manner is one mark of this and the same thing comes out again in his music full of passion his singing is and we have hardly anything to compare with it in this regard yet the listener can not help smiling now and then the very ﬁnest passage is followed so suddenly by some uncouth guttural note or by some whimsical drop from the top to the bottom of the scale in neighborly association with the brown thrush is the towhee bunting or chewink the two choose the same places their summer homes and unless i am deceived they often migrate in company but though they are so much together and in certai n of their ways very much alike their habits of mind are widely dissimilar the towhee is of peculiarly even disposition i have seldom heard him scold or use any note less natured and musical than his pleasant cherawink i have never detected him in quarrel such nearly all birds are once in while guilty of ungracious it may seem to mention the fact nor have i ever seen him hopping nervously about and twitching his tail is the manner of most species when instance their nests are approached nothing seems to annoy him at the same time he is not full of continual merriment like the chickadee nor occasionally in rapture like the goldﬁnch life with him is pitched in low key comfortable rather than cheerful and never jubilant and yet all the towhee careless demeanor you soon begin to suspect him of being deep he appears not to mind you he keeps on scratching among the dry leaves if he had thought of being driven away by your presence but in minute or two you look that way again and he is not there if you pass near his nest he makes not tenth part of the ado which brown thrush would make in the same circumstances but partly this reason you will ﬁnd half dozen nests of the thrush sooner than one of his with all his simplicity and frankness which puts him in happy contrast with the thrush he knows well anybody how to keep his own counsel i have seen him with his mate two or three days together about the ﬂower in the boston public garden and so far appeared they were feeding unconcernedly though they had been on their own native heath amid the and huckleberry bushes but after their departure it was remembered that they had not once been heard to utter sound if be four ﬁfths of good manners our pipilo may certainly pass gentleman we have now named four birds the chickadee the goldﬁnch the brown thrush and the towhee so diverse in plumage that eye could fail to discriminate them at the gentle law that each should be the other heaven and harmony the heavy and the weary weight of all this unintelligible world pg 62 pg 63 pg 64 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https but the four differ more truly in bodily shape and dress than they in that inscrutable something which we call temperament disposition if the soul of each were separated from the body and made to stand out in sight those of us who have really known the birds in the ﬂesh would have difﬁculty in saying this is the titmouse and this the towhee it would be with them we hope it will be with our friends in the next world whom we shall recognize there because we knew them here that is we knew them and not merely the bodies they lived in this kind of familiarity with birds has necessary connection with ornithology personal intimacy and knowledge of anatomy are still two different things we have all heard ours is an age of science but thank fortune matters have not yet gone so far that man must take course in anthropology before he can love his neighbor it is truth only too patent that taste and conscience are sometimes at odds one man wears his faults so gracefully that we can hardly help falling in love with them while another alas makes even virtue itself repulsive i am moved to this commonplace reﬂection by thinking of the blue jay bird of doubtful character but one whom nevertheless it is impossible not to feel sort of affection and even of respect he is quite suspicious the brown thrush and his instinct an invisible perch is perhaps unerring the cuckoo and yet even when he takes to hiding his manner is not without dash of boldness he has most irascible temper also but unlike the thrasher he does not allow his to degenerate into chronic sulkiness instead he ﬂies into furious passion and is done with it some say that on such occasions he swears and i have myself seen him when it was plain that nothing except natural impossibility kept him from tearing his hair his larynx would make him singer and his mental capacity is far above the average but he has perverted his gifts till his music is nothing but noise and his talent nothing but smartness like process of depravation the world has before now witnessed in political life when man of brilliant natural endowments has yielded to low ambitions and stooped to unworthy means till what was meant to be statesman turns put to be demagogue but perhaps we wrong our handsome friend fallen angel though he be to speak thus of him most likely he would resent the comparison and i not press it we must admit that juven ile sportsmen have persecuted him unduly and when creature can not show himself without being shot at he may be pardo ned little misanthropy christians we are how many of us could stand such test in these circumstances it is point in the jay favor that he still has what is rare with birds sense of humor albeit it is humor of rather grim sort sort which expends itself in practical jokes and uncivil epithets he has discovered the secret that the expression of unadulterated derision there is nothing like the short sound of prolonged into drawl yăh yăh he cries and sometimes you enter the woods you may hear him shouting so to be heard half mile here comes fool with gun look out him it is natural to think of the shrike in connection with the jay but the two have points of unlikeness less than of resemblanc the shrike is taciturn bird if he were politician he would rely chieﬂy on what is known the still hunt although he too can scream loudly enough on occasion his most salient trait is his impudence but even that is of negative type who are you he says that i should be at the trouble to insult you he has made study of the value of silence an indication of contem pt and is almost human in his ability to stare straight by person whose presence it suits him to ignore his imperturbability is wonderful watch him closely you please you will never discover what he is thinking about undertake instance now that the fellow is singing from the top of small tree only few rods from where you are standing undertake to settle the long dispute whether his notes are designed to decoy small birds within his reach those whistles and twitters them so miscellaneous so different from anything which would be expected from bird of his size and general disposition so very like the notes of sparrows they must be imitative you begin to feel quite sure of it but just at this point the sounds cease and you look up to discover that collurio has fallen to preening his feathers in the most listless manner imaginable look at he says i act like one on the watch his prey indeed sir i wish the innocent pg 65 pg 66 pg 67 pg 68 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https harm and besides if you must know it i ate an excellent two hours ago while laggards like you were still abed in the winter which is the only season when i have been able to observe him the shrike is to the last degree unsocial and i have known him to stay month in one spot all by himself spending good part of every day perched upon telegraph wire he ought not to be very happy with such disposition one would think but he seems to be well contented and sometimes his spirits are fairly exuberant perhaps the phrase is he enjoys himself in which case he certainly has the advantage of most of us indeed we are easily pleased at any rate he is philosopher enough to appreciate the value of having few wants and i am not sure but that he anticipated the vaunted discovery of teufelsdröckh that the fraction of life may be increased by lessening the denominator but even the stoical shrike is not without his epicurean weakness when he has killed sparrow he eats the brains ﬁrst after that if he is still hungry he devours the coarser and less savory parts in this however he only shares the universal inconsistency there are never many stoics in the world epictetus declared with an oath that he should be glad to see one 7 to take everything equally good to know difference between bitter and sweet penury and plenty slander and praise is great attainment nirvana to which few can hope to arrive some wise man has said and the remark has more meaning than may at once appear that dying is usually one of the last things which men in this world against the foil of the butcher stolidity we may set the inquisitive garrulous temperament of the vireo and the chat the vireo is hardly larger than the goldﬁnch but let him be in one of his conversational moods and he will ﬁll smilax thicket with noise enough two or three meanwhile he keeps his eye upon you and seems to be inviting your attention to his loquacious abilities the chat is perhaps even more voluble staccato whistles and snarls follow each other at most extraordinary intervals of pitch and the attempt at showing off is sometimes unmistakable occasionally he takes to the air and ﬂies from one tree to another teetering his body and jerking his tail in an indescribable fashion and chattering all the while his inner consciousness at such moment would be worth perusing possibly he has some feeling the grotesque but i suspect not probably what we laugh at the antics of clown is all sober earnest to him at best it is very little we can know about what is passing in bird mind we label him with two or three sesquipedalia verba give his territorial range describe his notes and his habits of nidiﬁcation and fancy we have rendered an account of the bird but how should we like to be inventoried in such style his name was john smith he lived in boston in brick house he had baritone voice but was not good singer all true enough but you call that man biography the four birds last spoken of are all wanting in reﬁnement the jay and the shrike are wild and rough not to say barbarous while the vireo and the chat have the character which commonly goes by the name of oddity all four are interesting their strong individuality and their picturesqueness but it is pleasure to turn from them to creatures like our four common new england hylocichlæ or small thrushes these are the real patricians with their modest but rich dress and their digniﬁed quiet demeanor they stand the true aristocratic spirit like all genuine aristocrats they carry an air of distinction of which one who approaches them can long remain unconscio us when you go into their haunts they not appear so much frightened offended why you intrude they seem to say these are our woods and they bow you out with all ceremony their songs are in keeping with this character leisurely unambit ious and brief but in beauty of voice and in high musical quality excelling all other music of the woods however i would not exaggerate and i have not found even these thrushes perfect the hermit who is my favorite of the four has habit of slowly raising and depressing his tail when his mind is trick of which it is likely he is unconscious but which to say the least is not mark of good breeding and the wilson while every note of his song breathes of spirituality has nevertheless most vulgar alarm call petulant nasal yeork i not know anything so grave against the pg 69 pg 70 pg 71 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https thrush or the swainson although when i have fooled the former with decoy whistles i have found him more inquisitive than seemed altogether becoming to bird of his quality but character without ﬂaw is hardly to be insisted on by sons of adam and after all deductions are made the claim of the hylocichlæ to noble blood can never be seriously disputed i have spoken of the four together but each is clearly distinguished from all the others and this i believe to be true of mental traits it is of details of plumage and song doubt in general they are much alike we may say that they have the same qualities but close acquaintance will reveal that the qualities have been mixed in different proportions so that the total result in each case is personalit y strictly unique and what is true of the hylocichlæ is true of every bird that ﬂies anatomy and dress and even voice aside who does not feel the dissimilarity between the and the robin and still more the difference amounting to contrast between the and the bluebird distinctions of color and form are what ﬁrst strike the eye but on better acquaintance these are felt to be superﬁcial and comparatively unimpor tant the difference is not one of outside appearance it is his gentle manner and not his azure coat which makes the bluebird and the would be in matter what garb so long he retained his obtrusive and his prying body spirit all of which being interpreted comes it may be to more than this fine feathers make ﬁne birds even in families containing many closely allied species i believe that every species has its own proper character which sufﬁcient intercourse would enable us to make due report of nobody ever saw manifesting the spirit of chipper and i trust it will not be in my day that any of our american sparrows are found emulating the virtues of their obstreperous immigrant cousin of course it is true of birds of men that some have much more individuality than others but know any bird or any man well enough and he will prove to be himself and nobody else to know the ten thousand birds of the world well enough to see how in bodily structure habit of life and mental characteristics every one is different from every other is the long and delightful task which is set before the ornithologist but this is not all the ornithology of the future must be ready to give an answer to the further question how these diver gences of anatomy and temperament originated how came the chickadee by his endless fund of happy spirits whence did the towh ee derive his equanimity and the brown thrush his saturnine temper the waxwing and the vireo have the same vocal organs why should the ﬁrst nothing but whisper while the second is so loud and voluble why is one bird belligerent and another peace able one barbarous and another civilized one grave and another gay who can tell we can make here and there plausible conjecture we know that the behavior of the blue jay varies greatly in different parts of the country in consequence of the different treatment which he receives we judge that the chickadee from the peculiarity of his feeding habits is more certain than most birds are of ﬁnding meal whenever he is hungry and that we are assured from experience goes long way toward making body contented we think it likely that the brown thrush is at some special disadvantage in this respect or has some peculiar enemies warring upon him in which case it is more than we might expect that he should be pessimist and with all our ignorance we are yet sure that everything has cause and we would fain hold by the brave word of emerson undoub tedly we have questions to ask which are unanswerable f t n t s this does not harmonize exactly with statement which emerson makes somewhere to the effect that all the stoics were stoics indeed but epictetus had never lived

to the white mountains and the and the in turn assured that the crawford house which i named my destination was not yet open they spoke too in the tone which men use when they mention something which but uncommon stupidity you would have known beforehand the kindly sarcasm missed its mark however i was aware that the hotel was not yet ready the general public but i said to myself that once at least i was not to be included in that unfashionably promiscuous company the vulgar crowd must wait of course the present the mountains in reporters language were on private view and despite the ignorance of railway ofﬁcials i was one of the elect in plainer phrase i had in my pocket letter from the manager of the famous inn before mentioned in which he promised to what he could my entertainment even though he was not yet he said keeping hotel possibly i made too much of small matter but it pleased to feel that this visit of mine was to be of peculiarly intimate character indeed if mount washington himself had bidden to private audience compelled to wait three or four hours in north conway i improved the oppo rtunity to stroll once more down into the lovely saco meadows whose green felicity was just now at its height here perched upon in the shadow of an elm i gazed at the mount washington range while the bobolinks and savanna sparrows made music on every side the song of the bobolinks dropped from above and the microphonic tune of the sparrows came up from the grass and earth keeping holiday together almost i could have believed myself in eden but alas even the birds themselves were long since shut out of that garden of innocence and i started back toward the village crow went hurrying past with kingbird in hot pursuit the latter was more fortunate than usual or more plucky actually alighting on the crow back and riding some distance i could not distinguish his motions was too far away that i wished him joy of his victory and grace to improve it to the full it is scandalous that bird of the crow cloth should be thief and so although i reckon him among my friends truth because i so am always able to take it patiently when i see him chastised his fault imperfect we all know each other to be it is comfort to feel that few of us are so altogether bad not to take more or less pleasure in seeing neighbor character improved under course of moderately painful discipline at bartlett word came that the passenger car would go further but that freight train would soon start on which if i chose i could continue my journey accordingly i rode up through the notch on platform car mode of conveyance which i can heartily and in all good conscience recommend there is crowd of exclaiming tourists the train of necessity moves slowly and the open platform offers obstruction to the view time i had seat which after little two strangers ventured to occupy with it an ill wind that blows nobody good and there happened to be on the car one piece of baggage cofﬁn inclosed in pine box our sitting upon it could not harm either it or us nor did we wean any disrespect to the man whoever he might be whose body was to be buried in it judging the dead charitably in duty bound i had doubt he would have been glad if he could have seen his narrow house put to such use so we made ourselves comfortable with it until at an invisible station it was taken

could look down upon the jagged rocks eighty feet below us one of the trio suddenly had an errand into the aforesaid leaving the platform to the other stranger and all in all the ride through the notch had never before been so enjoyable i thought and late in the evening i found myself once again at the crawford house and in one of the best rooms s well enough i might be being the only guest in the house the next morning before it was really light i was lying awake looking at mount webster while through the open window came the loud cheery song of the throated sparrows the hospitable creatures seemed to be inviting to come at once into their woods but i knew only too well that if the invitation were accepted they would every one of them take to hiding like bashful children the is one of the birds whom i cherish special liking on my ﬁrst trip to the mountains i jumped off the train moment at bartlett and had hardly touched the ground before i heard his familiar call here then was peabody at home season after season he had camped near in massachusetts and many time i had been gladdened by his lively serenade now he greeted from his own native woods so far my observations have gone he is common throughout the mountain region and that in spite of the standard which puts him down patronizing the glen house almost exclusively he knows the routes too well to need any guide however and may be excused his ignorance of the ofﬁcial programme it is wonderful how shy he is more wonderful because during his migrations his manner is so very different then even in city park you may watch him at your leisure while his loud clear whistle is often to be heard rising above din of and heavy wagons but here in his summer quarters you will listen to his song hundred times before you once catch glimpse of the singer at ﬁrst thought it seems strange that bird should be most at home when he is away from home but in the one case he has nothing but his own safety to consult while in the other he is thinkin g of those whose lives are more to him than his own and whose he is every moment on the alert to conceal in massachusetts we not expect to ﬁnd sparrows in deep woods they belong in ﬁelds and pastures in roadside thickets or by and old bordered with barberry bushes and alders but these are children of the wilderness it is one charm of their music that it always comes or seems to come from such distance from far up the or from the inaccessible depths of some ravine i shall not soon forget its wild beauty it rose out of the spruce forests below while i was enjoying an evening promenade all by myself over the long ﬂat summit of moosilauke from his habit of singing late at night this sparrow is in some places known the nightingale his more common name is the peabody bird while jefferson man who was driving over the cherry mountain road called him the peverly bird and told the following story farmer named peverly was walking about his ﬁelds one spring morning trying to make up his mind whether the time had come to put in his wheat the question was important and he was still in deep quandary when bird spoke up out of the wood and said sow wheat peverly peverly peverly wheat peverly peverly peverly that settled the matter the wheat was sown and in the fall most abundant harvest was gathered and ever since then this little feathered oracle has been known the peverly bird we have improved on the custom of the ancients they examined bird entrails we listen to his song who says the yankee is not wiser than the greek but i was lying abed in the crawford house when the voice of zonotrichia albicollis sent my thoughts thus astray from moosila uke to delphi that day and the two following were passed in roaming about the woods near the hotel the pretty painted trillium was in blossom was also the dark purple species and the showed its broad white cymes in all directions here and there was the modest little spring beauty claytonia pg 81 pg 82 pg 83 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https and not far from the elephant head i discovered my ﬁrst and only patch of dicentra with its delicate dissected leaves and its oddly shaped petals of white and pale yellow the false mitrewort tiarella cordifolia was in ﬂower likewise and the spur which is cut off mount willard by the railroad was all aglow with rhodora perfect ﬂower on the monochromatic plan now so much in vogue along the edge of the rocks on the summit of mount willard great profusion of the common saxif rage was waving in the fresh breeze on the lower parts of the mountains the foliage was already well out while the upper parts were of ﬁne purplish tint which at ﬁrst i was unable to account but which i soon discovered to be due to the fact that the trees at that height were still only in bud notable feature of the white mountain forests is the absence of oaks and hickories these tough hard woods would seem to have been created on purpose to stand against wind and cold but the hills are covered with the fragile poplars and birches and spruces with never an oak or hickory among them i suspect indeed that it is the very softness of the former which gives them their advantage this i suppose is correlated with rapid growth and where the summer is very short speed may count more than ﬁrmness of texture especiall y during the ﬁrst one or two years of the plant life trees like men lose in one way what they gain in another or in other words they have the defects of their qualities probably paul confession when i am weak then am i strong is after all only the personal statement of general law true of poplar of christian we all believe we not that the world is universe governed throughout by one mind so that whatever holds in one part is good everywhere but it was june and the birds who were singing from daylight till dark would have the most of my attention it was pleasant to ﬁnd here two comparatively rare warblers of whom i had before had only casual glimpses mourning warbler and the breasted the former was singing his loud but commonplace ditty within few rods of the piazza on one side of the house while his congener the maryland was to be heard on the other side along with the dendrœca striata the yellow and the canadian ﬂycatcher the mourning warbler song i heard it was like this whit whit whit wit wit the ﬁrst three notes were deliberate and loud on one key and without accent the last two were pitched little lower and were shorter with the accent on the ﬁrst of the pair they were thinner in tone than the opening triplet is meant to be indicated by the difference of spelling 8 others of the family were the thrush the water the the blackburnian with his characteristic zillup zillup zillup the green the blue the last with his loud coarse kree kree kree the redstart and the elegant blue altogether they were gor geous company but the chief singers were the thrushes and the winter wrens i should be glad to know on just what principle the and their near relatives the hermits distribute themselves throughout the mountain region each species seems to have its own sections to which it returns year after year and the being is well known the more northern species of the two naturally prefers the more elevated situations i have found the latter abundant near the proﬁle house and three seasons it has had exclusive possession of the white mountain notch far at least i have been able to discover 9 the hermits on the other hand frequent such places north conway gorham jefferson bethlehem and the vicinity of the flume only once have i found the two species in the same neigh borhood that was near the breezy point house on the side of mount moosilauke but this place is so peculiarly romantic with its noble amphitheatre of hills that i could not wonder neither species was willing to yield the ground entirely to the other and even here it was to be noticed that the hermits were in or pg 84 ten thousand saw i at glance tossing their heads in sprightly dance pg 85 pg 86 pg 87 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https the sugar while the swain sons were in the forest far off in an opposite direction 10 it is these birds if any whose music reaches the ears of the ordinary mounta in tourist every man who is known among his acquaintances to have little knowledge of such things is approached now and then with the question what bird was it that i heard singing up in the mountains i did see him he was always ever so far off but his voice was wonderful so sweet and clear and loud rule it may safely be taken granted that such interrogator ies refer either to the swainson thrush or to the hermit the inquirer is very likely disposed to be incredulous when he is told that there are birds in his own woods whose voice is so like that of his admired new hampshire songster that if he were to hear the two together he would not at ﬁrst be able to tell the one from the other he has never heard them he protests which is true enough he never goes into the woods of his own town or if by chance he does he leaves his ears behind him in the shop his case is not peculiar men and women gaze enraptured at new hampshire sunsets how glorious they are to be sure what pity the sun does not sometimes set in massachusetts musician the is certainly inferior to the hermit and according to my taste he is surpassed also by the wood thrush and the wilson but he is magniﬁcent singer all that and when he is heard in the absence of the others it is often hard to believe that any one of them could better good idea of the rhythm and length of his song may be gained by pronouncing somewhat rapidly the words i love i love i love you or it sometimes runs i love i love i love you truly how literal this translation is i am not scholar enough to determine but without question it gives the sense substantially the winter wrens were less numerous than the thrushes i think but like them they sang at all hours of the day and seemed to be well distributed throughout the woods we can hardly help asking how it is that two birds so very closely related the house wren and the winter wren should have been chosen haunts so extremely diverse one preferring in thickly settled villages the other keeping strictly to the wildest of all wild places but whatever the explanation we need not wish the fact itself different comparatively few ever hear the winter wren song to be sure you will hardly get it from hotel piazza but it is not the less enjoyed on that account there is such thing bird making himself too common and probably it is true even of the great prima donna that it is not those who live in the house with her who ﬁnd most pleasure in her music moreover there is much in time and circumstance you hear song in the village street and pass along unmoved but stand in the silence of the forest with your feet in bed of creeping snowberry and oxalis and the same song goes to your very soul the great distinction of the winter wren melody is its marked rhythm and accent which give it martial character note tumbles over note in the true wren manner and the strain comes to an end so suddenly that the ﬁrst few times you are likely to think that the bird has been interrupted in the middle is long note much like one of the canary the odd little creature does not get far away from the ground i have never seen him sing from living tree or bush but always from stump or log or from the root or branch of an overturned tree something at least of nearly his own color 11 the song is intrinsically one of the most beautiful and in my ears it has the further merit of being forever associated with reminiscences of ramblings among the white hills how well i remember an early morning hour at proﬁle lake when it came again and again across the water from the woods on mount cannon under the great stone face whichever way i walked i was sure of the society of the they hopped familiarly across the railroad track in front of the crawford house and on the summit of mount washington were scurrying about among

two out dropped at my feet and ran across the road trailing her wings i looked under the bank her nest but to my surprise could ﬁnd nothing of it so i made sure of knowing the place again and continued my tramp returning two hours later i sat down upon the same bowlder and watched the bird to appear before but she had gathered courage from my former failure so it seemed i waited in vain till i rapped upon the ground over her head then she scrambled out and limped away repeating her innocent but hackneyed ruse this time i was resolved not to be bafﬂed the nest was there and i would ﬁnd it so down on my knees i got and scrutinized the whole place most carefully but though i had marked the precise spot there was sign of nest i was about giving over the search ignominiously when i descried slight opening between the overhanging roof of the bank and layer of earth which some roots held in place close under it into this slit i inserted my ﬁngers and there entirely out of sight was the nest full of eggs man could ever have found it had the bird been brave and wise enough to keep her seat however i had before this noticed that the while often extremely clever in choosing building site is seldom very skillful in keeping secret i saw him one day standing on the side of the same mount willard road 12 gesticu lating and scolding with all his might much to say please stop here go straight along i beg of you our nest is right under this bank and one glance under the bank showed that i had not misinterpreted his demonstrations all that i not feel like taking lofty tone in passing judgment upon junco he is not the only one whose wisdom is mixed with foolishness there is at least one other person of whom the same is true person of whom i have nevertheless very good opinion and with whom i am or ought to be better acquainted than i am with any animal that wears feathers the prettiest nest i ever saw was built beside the crawford bridle path on mount clinton just before the path comes out of the woods at the top it was lined with species of polytrichum of bright orange color and with its four or ﬁve white eggs made so attractive picture that i was constrained to pause moment to look at it even though i had three miles of steep rough footpath to descend with shower threatening to overtake before i could reach the bottom i wondered whether the architects really possessed an eye color or had only stumbled upon this elegant bit of decoration on the whole it seemed more charitable to conclude the former and not only more charitable but more scientiﬁc well if i under stand the matter aright darwin and his followers have settled upon the opinion that birds display an unmistakable fondness bright tints that indeed the males of many species wear brilliant plumage other reason than that their mates prefer them in that dress moreover if bird in new south wales adorns her bower with shells and other ornaments why may not our little northern darling beautify her nest with such humbler materials her surroundings offer on reﬂection i am more and more convinced that the birds knew what they were doing probably the female the moment she discovered the moss called to her mate oh look how lovely my dear let line our nest with it this artistic structure was found on the anniversary of the battle of bunker hill day which i had been celebrating best i could by climbing the highest hill in new england plunging into the woods within ﬁfty yards of the crawford house i had gone up and up and on and on through magniﬁcent forest and then over more magniﬁcent rocky heights until i stood at last on the platform of the hotel at the summit true the path which i had never traveled before was wet and slippery with stretches of ice and snow here and there but the shifting view was so grand the atmosphere so bracing and the solitude so impressive that i enjoyed every step till it came to clamberin g up the mount washington cone over

by boy with is not in any strict sense paradisiacal and yet who knows the heart of bird child possibly or poet certainly not philosopher and happiness too that something of which the scientiﬁc mind can render us quite adequate description or is it rather wayward mysterious thing coming often when least expected and going away again when by all tokens it ought to remain how is it with ourselves we wait to weigh all the good and evil of our state to take an accurate account of it pro and con before we allow ourselves to be glad or sorry not many of us i think mortuary tables may demonstrate that half the children born in this country fail to reach the age of twenty years but what then our expectation of life is not based upon statistics the tables may be correct aught we know but they deal with men in general and on the average they have message you and individually and it seems not unlikely that birds may be equally illogical always expecting to live and not die and often giving themselves up to impulses of gladness without stopping to inquire whether on grounds of absolute reason these impulses are to be justiﬁed let us hope so at all events till somebody proves the contrary but even looking at the subject little more philosophically we may be thankful to say the joy of life is not dependent upon comfort nor yet upon safety the essential matter is that the heart be engaged then though we be toiling up the matterhorn or swept along in the rush of bayonet charge we may still ﬁnd existence not only endurable but in the highest degree exhilarating on the other hand if there is longer anything we care if enthusiasm is dead and hope also then though we have all that money can buy suicide is perhaps the only ﬁtting action that is left us unless perchance we are still able to pass the time in writing treatises to prove that everybody else ought to be unhappy ourselves birds have many enemies and their full share of privation but i not believe that they often suffer from ennui having neither storehouse nor barn 15 they are never in want of something to from sunrise till noon there is the getting of breakfast then from noon till sunset the getting of dinner and without any trouble of cookery or dishes kind of perpetual picnic what could be simpler or more delightful carried on in this way eating is longer the coarse and sensual thing we make it with our set and elaborate preparations country children know that there are two ways to go berrying according to the ﬁrst of these you stroll into the pasture in the cool of the day and at your leisure pick many you choose of the ripest and largest of the berries putting every one into your mouth this is agreeable according to the second you carry basket which you are expected to bring home again well ﬁlled and this tastes will differ but following the good old rule judging in such cases i must believe that most unsophisticated persons prefer the other the process certainly agrees best with our idea of life in eden and what is more to the purpose now it is the one which the birds still keeping the garden instead of tilling the ground continue to follow that this unworldliness of the birds has any religious or theological signiﬁcance i not myself suppose still anybody may see there are certain very plain scripture texts on their side indeed if birds were only acute theologians they would unquestionably proceed to turn these texts since they ﬁnd it so easy to obey them into the basis of system of truth other parts of the bible must be interpr eted to be sure so the theory pg 106 pg 107 pg 108 pg 109 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https run but these statements mean just what they say and whoever meddles with them is carnally minded and rationalist somebody will object perhaps that with our talk about perpetual picnic we are making bird life one cloudless holiday contradicting what we have before admitted about struggle existence and leaving out of sight altogether the seasons of scarcity the storms and the biting cold but we intend such foolish recantation these hardships are real enough and serious enough what we maintain is that evils of this kind are not necessarily inconsistent with enjoyment and may even give to life an additional zest it is matter of observation that the people who have nothing to except to live well the common sarcasm has it are not always the most cheerful while there are certain diseases like pessimism and the gout which seem appointed to wait on luxury and idleness though nature were determined to have the scales kept somewhat even and surely this divine law of compensation has not left the innocent birds unprovided innocent birds of whom it was said your heaven ly father feedeth them how must the devoted pair exult when in spite of owls and hawks squirrels and weasels small boys and oölogists they have ﬁnally reared brood of offspring the long uncertainty and the thousand perils only intensify the joy in truth so far this world is concerned the highest bliss is never to be had without antecedent sorrow and even of heaven itself we may not scruple to say that if there are painters there they probably feel obliged to put some shadows into their pictures but of course and this is what we have been coming to through this long introduction course our friends of the air are happiest in the season of mating happiest and therefore most attractive to us who ﬁnd our pleasure in studying them in spring of all times of the year it seems pity that everybody should not turn ornithologist all mankind love lover and the world in consequence has given itself up to reading not knowing unfortunately how much better that rôle is taken by the birds than by the common run of heroes people whose notions of the subject are derived from attending to the antics of our imported sparrows have idea how delicate and beautiful thing real feathered courtship is to tell the truth these forei gners have associated too long and too intimately with men and have fallen far away from their primal innocence there is need to describe their actions the vociferous and most unmannerly importunity of the suitor and the correspondingly spiteful rejection of his overtures by the little vixen on whom his affections are the moment placed we have all seen to our hearts discontent the sparrow will not have been brought over the sea nothing however if his bad behavior serves to heighten our appreciation of our own native songsters with their perfect virtues and manners the heart

and you will begin to feel quite new respect him how gently he approaches his beloved how carefully he avoids ever coming disrespectfully near screaming dancing about melodramatic gesticulation if she moves from one side of the tree to the other or to the tree adjoining he follows in silence yet every movement is petition an assurance that his heart is hers and ever must be the action is extremely simple there is nothing of which to make an eloquent description but i should pity the man who could witness it with indifference not that the robin suit is always carried on in the same way he is much too versatile that on one occasion at least i saw him holding himself absolutely motionless in horizontal posture staring at his sweetheart if he would charm her with his gaze and emitting all the while subdued hissing sound the signiﬁcance of this conduct i not profess to have understood it ended with his suddenly darting at the female who took wing and was pursued not improbably the robin

very similar to this of the robin standing on the dead branch of tree with his crown feathers erect his bill set wide open and his whole body looking rigid death his mate i perceived the next moment was not far away on the same limb if he was attempting fascination he had gone very clumsily about it i thought unless his mate idea of beauty was totally different from mine i could hardly keep from laughing at his absurd appearance it did not occur to till afterwards that he had perhaps heard of othello method and was at that moment acting out story how much depends upon the point of view here was i ready to laugh while poor desdemona only thought was pitiful was wondrous pitiful dear sympathetic soul let us hope that she was never called to play out the tragedy two things are very noticeable during the pairing season scarcity of females and their indifference every one of them seems to have at least two admirers dangling after her 16 while she is almost sure to carry herself if wedding were the last thing she would ever consent to think of and that not because of bashfulness but from downright aversion the observer begins to suspect that the fair creatures have really entered into some sort of league and that there are not to be any nests this year nor any young birds but by and by he discovers that somehow he can not surmise how must have been when his eyes were turned the other way scene is entirely changed the maidens are all wedded and even now the nests are being got ready i watched trio of in clump of alder bushes by the roadside two males almost matter of course paying attentions to one female both suitors were evidently in earnest each hoped to carry off the prize and perhaps felt that he should be miserable forever if he were disappointed and yet on their part everything was being done decently and in order so far i saw there was disposition to quarrel only let the dear creature choose one of them and the other would take his broken heart away so always at modest remove they followed her about from bush to bush entreating her in most loving and persuasive tones to listen to their suit but she all this time answered every approach with snarl she would never have anything to with either of them she disliked them both and only wished they would leave her to herself this lasted long i stayed to watch still i had little doubt she fully intended to accept one of them and had even made up her mind already which it should be she knew enough i felt sure to calculate the value of proper maidenly reluctance how could her mate be expected to rate her at her worth if she allowed herself to be won too easily besides she could afford not to be in haste seeing she had choice of two what comfortably simple affair the matrimonial question is with the feminine her wooers are all of equally good family and all equally rich there is literall y nothing her to but to look into her own heart and choose temptation has she to sell herself the sake of fashionable name or ﬁne house or in order to gratify the prejudice of father or mother marriage settlement she knows neither the name nor the thing in fact marriage in her thought is simple union of hearts with taint of anything mercantile about it happy she perhaps imagines that human marriages are of the same ideal sort i have spoken of the affectionate language of these dusky lovers but it was noticeable that they did not sing although to have fulﬁlled the common idea of such an affair they pg 1 13 of most disastrous chances of moving accidents by ﬂood and ﬁeld of hair scapes i

and each trying his best to outsing the other possibly there had already been such tournament before my arrival or aught i know this particular female may have given out that she had ear music in point of fact however there was nothing peculiar in their conduct doubt in the earlier stages of bird attachment he is likely to express his passion musically but later he is not content to warble from there are things to be said which can not appropriately be spoken at long range and unless my study of novels has been to little purpose all this agrees well with the practices of human gallants not these begin by singing under the lady window or by sending verses to her and are not such proceedings intended to prepare the way speedily possible others of more satisfying though it may be of less romantic nature bearing this in mind we may be able to account in part at least the inexperienced observer disappointment when fresh from the perusal of example the thirteenth chapter of darwin

while feminine auditor sits in full view preparing to render her verdict and reward the successful competitor with her own precious self this would be pretty picture unfortunately it is looked in vain the two or three singers may be found likely enough but the female if she be indeed within hearing is modestly hidden away somewhere in the bushes and our student is none the wiser let him watch long he please he will hardly see the prize awarded nevertheless he need not grudge the time thus employed not at any rate if he be sensitive to music it will be found that birds have at least one attribute of genius they can their best only on great occasions our brown thrush insta nce is magniﬁcent singer albeit he is not of the best school being too sensational to suit the most exacting taste his song is grand improvisation good deal jumbled to be sure and without any recognizable form or theme and yet like liszt rhapsody it perfectly answers its purpose is it gives the performer full scope to show what he can with his instrument you may laugh little if you like at an occasional grotesque or overwrought passage but unless you are well used to it you will surely be astonished such power and range of voice such startling transitions such endless variety and withal such boundless enthusiasm and almost incredible endurance regarded pure mu sic one strain of the hermit thrush is to my mind worth the whole of it just single movement of beethoven is better than world of liszt transcriptions but in its own way it is unsurpassable still though this is meagre and quite unexaggerated account of the ordinary song of the brown thrush i have discovered that even he can be himself one morning in early may i came upon three birds of this species all singing at once in kind of jealous frenzy they sang they continually shifted from tree to tree and one in particular the one nearest to where i stood could hardly be quiet moment once he sang with full power while on the ground or close to it he was just then behind low bush after which he mounted to the very tip of tall pine which bent beneath his weight in the midst of the one of the trio suddenly sounded the

turned to come away the contest all at once ceased and the silence of the woods or what seemed like silence was really impressive the chewinks and ﬁeld sparrows were singing but it was like the music

victory the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https is curious how deeply we are sometim es affected by very triﬂing occurrence i have remembered many times slight scene in which three purple ﬁnches were the actors of the two males one was in full adult plumage of bright crimson while the other still wore his youthful suit of brown first the older bird suspended himself in mid air and sang most beautifully dropping he conc luded to perch beside the female then the younger candidate who was already sitting near by took his turn singing nearly or quite well his rival but without quitting the branch though his wings quivered i saw more yet i say i have often since thought of the three birds and wondered whether the bright feathers and the ﬂying song carried the day against the younger suitor i fear they did sometimes too i have queried whether young birds who none the less are of age to marry can be so very meek or so very dull never to rebel against the fashion that only the old fellows shall dress handsomely and i have tried in vain to imagine the mutterings deep and loud which such law would excite in certain other quarters it pains to say it but i suspect that taxation without representation would seem small injustice in comparison like these linnets in the exceptional interest they excited were two large seabirds who suddenly appeared circling about over the woods i was taking solitary walk on sunday morning in april one of them was closely pursuing the other not though he were trying to overtake her but rather though he were determined to keep her company they swept now this way now that lost to sight and now reappearing and once they passed straight over my head so that i heard the whistling of their wings then they were off and i saw them more they came from far and by night they were perhaps hundred leagues away but i followed them with my blessing and to this day i feel toward them little i suppose we all toward certain few strangers whom we have met here and there in our journeyings and chatted with an hour or two we had never seen them before if we learned their names we have long ago forgotten them but somehow the persons themselves keep place in our memory and even in our af fection since we can not ask birds an explanation of their conduct we have nothing it but to steal their secrets far possible by patient and stealthy watching in this way i hope sooner or later to ﬁnd out what the woodpecker means by the shout with which he makes the ﬁelds reëcho in the spring especially in the latter half of april i have doubt it has something to with the process of mating but it puzzles to guess just what the message can be which requires to be published so loudly such stentorian cry you wonder where the bird ﬁnds breath such an effort and think he must be very ungentle lover surely but withhold your judgment few days till you see him and his mate gamboling about the branches of some old tree calling in soft affectionate tones then you will confess that whatever failings the may have he is not to be charged with insensibility the fact is that our has genius noise when he is very happy he drums sometimes indeed he marvels how birds who have this resource are able to get through the world at all nor ought we to think it strange if in his he ﬁnds great use this his crowning accomplishment true we have nowhere read of human lover serenading his mistress with drum but we must remember what creatures of convention men are and that there is inherent reason why drum should not serve well ﬂute such purpose pg 120 pg 121 i crossed moor with name of its own and certain use in the world doubt yet hand breadth of it shines alone the blank miles round about there i picked up on the heather and there i put inside my breast moulted feather an well i get the rest pg 122 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https saw two of these ﬂickers clinging to the trunk of tree which by the way is tree after the woodpecker own heart one was perhaps ﬁfteen feet above the other and before each was strip of loose bark sort of natural first the lower one beat his music out rather softly then he ceased and held his head back to listen the other answered him and so the dialogue went on evidently they were already mated and were now renewing their mutual vows birds to their praise be it spoke n believe in courtship after marriage the day happened to be sunday and it did occur to that possibly this was the woodpeckers ritual kind of high church service with antiphonal choirs but i dismissed the thought on the whole the shouting seems more likely to be diagnostic and in spite of his wings i have set the ﬂicker down almost certainly an methodist speaking of courtship after marriage i am reminded of spotted sandpiper whose capers i amused myself with watching one day last june on the shore of saco lake i caught sight of him he was straightening himself up with pretty air at the same time spreading his tail and calling tweet tweet tweet 18 afterwards he got upon log where with head erect and wings thrown forward and down ward he ran yard or two calling before this trick seemed especially to please him and was several times repeated he ran rapidly and with comical prancing movement but nothing he did was half so laughable the behavior of his mate who all this while dressed her feathers without once deigning to look at her spouse performance undoubtedly they had been married several weeks and she was by this time well used to his nonsense it must be devoted husband i fancy who continues to offer attentions when they are received in such spirit walking log is somewhat common practice with birds i once detected our little thrush showing off in this way to his mate who stood on the ground close at hand in his case the head was lowered instead of raised and the general effect was heightened by his curiously precise gait which even on ordinary occasions is enough to provoke smile not improbably every species of birds has its own code of etiquette unwritten of course but carefully handed down from father to son and faithfully observed nor is it cause wonder if in our ignorant eyes some of these society manners look little ridiculous even the usages of fashionable human circles have not always escaped the laughter of the profane i was standing on the edge of small thicket observing pair of cuckoos they made break fast out of nest of tent caterpillars it was feast rather than common meal the caterpillars were plentiful and i judged just at their best being about half grown when couple of scarlet tanagers appeared upon the scene the female presently selected ﬁne strip of cedar bark and started off with it sounding call to her handsome husband who at once followed in her wake i thought what brute to leave his wife to build the house but he plainly enough felt that in escorting her back and forth he was doing all that ought to be expected of any tanager and the lady herself if one might infer anything from her tone and demeanor was of the same opinion i mention this triﬂing occurrence not to put any slight upon pyranga rubra who am i that i should accuse so gentle and well dressed bird of bad manners but merely an example of the way in which feathered politeness varies in fact it seems not unlikely that the male tanager may abstain on principle from taking any active part in constructing the nest lest his ﬁery color should betray its whereabouts his kindness and loyalty i only wish i could feel sure of one half the human husbands whom i meet all thoughts all passions all delights whatever stirs this mortal frame all are but ministers of love and feed his sacred ﬂame pg 123 pg 124 pg 125 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https would be very ungallant of however to leave my readers to understand that the female bird is always so unsympathetic most of the descriptions thus far given would appear to indicate in my memory are several scenes any one of which if i could put it on paper i saw it would sufﬁce to correct such an erroneous impression in one of these the parties were pair of chipping sparrows never was man so churlish that his heart would not have been touched with the vision of their gentle but rapturous delight they chased each other gayly from branch to branch and from tree to tree they ﬂew with that delicate affected movement of the wings which birds are accustomed to use at such times and which perhaps bears the same relation to their ordinary ﬂight that dancing does to the walk of men and women the two seemed equally enchanted and both sang little they knew of the struggle existence and the survival of the ﬁttest adam and eve in paradise were never more happy few weeks later taking an evening walk i was stopped by the sight of pair of cedar birds on stone wall they had chosen convenient ﬂat stone and were hopp ing about upon it pausing every moment or two to put their little bills together what loving ecstasy possessed them sometimes one sometimes the other sounded faint lisping note and motioned another kiss but there is setting forth the ineffable grace and sweetness of their chaste behavior i looked and looked till passing carriage frightened them away they were only common cedar if i were to see them again i should not know them but if my pen were equal to my wish they should be made immortal f t n t s wallace natural selection the shrike lays up grasshoppers and sparrows and the california

robin who was standing on the lawn absolutely motionless and every few seconds making faint hissing noise so much engaged was he that even when dog ran near him he only started slightly and on the instant resumed his like attitude wondering what this could mean and not knowing how else to satisfy my curiosity i bethought myself of man whose letters about birds i had now and then noticed in the daily press so looking up his name in the city directory and ﬁnding that he lived at such number beacon street i wrote him note of inquiry he must have been amused he read it i remember giving him the title of esquire and speaking of his communications to the newspape rs the ground of my application to him such is fame he likely enough said to himself here is man with eyes in his head man moreover who has probably been at school in his time most of his words are spelled correctly yet he knows my name only he has seen it signed once in while to few lines in newspaper thoughts like these however did not prevent his replying to the note my valued favor with all politeness although he confessed himself unable to answer my question and by the time i had occasion to trouble him again i had learned that he was to be addressed doctor and furthermore was an ornithologist of reputation being in fact one of the three of the most important work so far issued on the birds of north america certainly i was and am grateful to him he is now dead his generous treatment of my ignorance but even warmer is my feeling toward that city thrush who all uncon scious of what he was doing started that day on line of study which has been ever since continual delight most gladly would i him any kindness in my power but i have little doubt that long ere this he too has gone the way of all the earth to what he was thinking about on that memorable may morning i am much in the dark ever but there is law against bird behaving mysteriously i suppose most of us i am sure often things which are inexplicable to ourselves and once in very great while perhaps it would puzzle even our neighbors to render complete account of our motives whatever the robin meant however and doubt there was some good reason his conduct he had given my curiosity the needed jog now at last i would what i had often dreamed of doing something about the birds of my own region and be able to recognize at least the more common ones when i saw them the interest of the study proved to be the greater my ignorance which to speak within bounds was nothing short of wonderful perhaps i might appropriately use more fashionable word and call it phenomenal all my life long i had had kind of passion being and to tell the truth i had been so often seen wandering by myself in or sitting idly about on stone walls in lonesome pastures that some of my philistine townsmen had most likely come to look upon better than vagabond yet i was not vagabond all that i liked work perhaps well the generality of people but i was unfortunate in this respect while i enjoyed work i hated to be in the house and on the other hand while i enjoyed being i hated all manner of employment i was not lazy but i let us call it the true aboriginal temperament though i fear that this distinction will be found too subtile even the unless along with their education they have certain sympathetic bias which after all is the main thing to be depended on in such nice psychological discriminations with all my rovings in wood and ﬁeld however i knew nothing of any air study study was thing of books at schoo l we were never taught

the when birds and plants were though they were not i can not recollect that any one of my teachers ever called my attention to natural object it seems incredible but so far my memory serves i was never in the habit of observing the return of the birds in the spring or their departure in the autumn except to be sure that the ﬂight of the ducks and geese was always pleasant excitement more especially because there were several lakes invari ably spoken of ponds in our vicinity on the borders of which the village gunners built booths in the season but now i have said my ignorance was converted all at once into kind of blessing sooner had i begun to read bird books and consult cabinet of mounted specimens than every turn became full of all manner of delightful surprises could it be that what i now beheld with so much wonder was only the same had been going on year after year in these my own familiar lanes and woods truly the human eye is nothing more than window of use unless the man looks out of it some of the experiences of that period seem ludicrous enough in the retrospect only two or three days after my eyes were ﬁrst opened i was out with friend in search of ﬂowers i was piloting him to favorite station viola pubescens when i saw most elegant little creature mainly black and white but with brilliant orange markings he was darting hither and thither among the branches of some low trees while i stared at him in amazement calling on my comrade who was ignorant myself but less excited to behold the prodigy half trembling lest the bird should prove to be some strag gler from the tropics the like of which would not be found in the cabinet before mentioned i went thither that very evening alas my silly fears there stood the little beauty exact counterpart labeled setophaga ruticilla the american redstart bird which the manual assured was very common in my neighborhood but it was not my eyes only that were opened my ears also were touched it was if all the birds had heretofore been silent and now under some sudden impulse had broken out in universal concert what glorious chorus it was and every voice stranger week or more i was puzzled by song which i heard without fail whenever i went into the woods but the author of which i could never set eyes on song so exceptionally loud and shrill and marked by such vehement crescendo that even to my ears it stood out from the general medl ey thing by itself many times i struck into the woods in the direction whence it came but without getting so much ﬂying glimpse of the musician very mysterious surely finally by accident i believe i caught the fellow in the very act of singing he stood on dead and few minutes later he was on the ground walking about not hopping with the primmest possible gait small bird with an orange crown and speckled breast then i knew him the thrush but it was not some time after this that i heard his famous evening song and it was longer still before i found his curious roofed nest happy those early days those days of childish innocence i was man grown every bird seemed newly created and even the redstart and the wood wagtail were like rarities from the ends of the earth verily my case was like unto adam when every fowl of the air was brought before him name one evening on my way back to the city after an afternoon ramble i stopped just at dusk in grove of hemlocks and soon out of the overhead came song brief strain of about six notes in musical but rather rough voice and in exquisite accord with the quiet solemnity of the hour again and again the sounds fell on my ear and often i endeavored to obtain view of the singer but he was in the thick of the upper branches and i looked him in vain how delicious the music was perfect lullaby drowsy and restful like the benediction of the wood on the spirit of tired i blessed the unknown songster in return and even now i have feeling that the peculiar enjoyment which the song of the green warbler never fails to afford may perhaps be due in some measure to its association with that twilight hour pg 135 pg 136 pg 137 pg 138 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https this same hemlock grove i was in the habit in those days of going now and then to listen to the evening hymn of the veery or wilson thrush here if nowhere else might be heard music ﬁt to be called sacred nor did it seem disadvantage but rather the contrary when sometimes happened i was compelled to take my seat in the edge of the wood and wait quietly in the gathering darkness vespers to begin the veery mood is not so lofty the hermit nor is his music to be compared brilliancy and fullness with that of the wood thrush but more than any other know n to the veery has if i may say so the accent of sanctity nothing is here of consciousness nothing of earthly pride or passion if we chance to overhear it and laud the singer that is our affair worshiper that he is he has never dreamed of winning praise himself by the excellent manner in which he praises his creator absence of thrift which is very becoming in thrushes though i suppose it is hardly to be looked in human choirs and yet all the unstudied ease and simplicity of the veery strain he is great master of technique in his own artless way he does what i have never heard any other bird attempt he gives to his melody all the force of harmony how this unique and curious effect this vocal violinist might term it is produced is not certainly known but it would seem that it must be by an arpeggio struck with such consummate quickness and precision that the ear is unable to follow it and is conscious of nothing but the resultant chord at any rate the thing itself is indisputable and has often been commented on moreover this is only half the veery technical proﬁciency once in while at least he will favor you with delightful feat of ventriloquism beginning to sing in single voice usual and anon without any noticeable increase in the loudness of the tones diffusing the music throughout the wood if there were bird in every tree all singing together in the strictest time i am not sure that all members of the species possess this power and i have never seen the performance alluded to in print but i have heard it when the illusion was complete and the ef fect most beautiful music so devout and unostentatious the veery does not appeal to the hurried or the preoccupied if you would enjoy it you must bring an ear to hear i have sometimes pleased myself with imagining resemblance between it and the poetry of geor ge herbert uncared by the world but both on that very account prized all the more dearly by the few in every generation whose spirits are in tune with theirs this bird is one of group of small thrushes called the hylocichlæ of which group we have ﬁve representatives in the atlantic states the wood thrush the wilson or tawny thrush the hermit the or swainson and the or alice thrush to the unpracticed eye the ﬁve all look alike all of them too have the same glorious voice so that the young student is pretty sure to ﬁnd it matter of some difﬁculty to tell them apart yet there are differences of coloration which may be trusted constant and to which after while the eye becomes habituated and at the same time each species has song and otes peculiar to itself one can not help wishing indeed that he might hear the ﬁve singi ng by turns in the same wood then he could ﬁx the distinguishing peculiarities of the different songs in his mind so never to confuse them again but this is more than can be hoped the listener must be content with hearing two or at the most three of the species singing together and trust his memory to make the necessary comparison the song of the wood thrush is perhaps the most easily set apart from the rest because of its greater compass of voice and bravery of execution the wilson song you hear it by itself seems so perfectly characteristic that you fancy you can never mistake any other it and yet if you are in northern new england only week afterwards you may possibly hear swainson especially if he happens to be one of the best singers of his species and more especially still if he happens to be at just the right distance away who you will say at ﬁrst thought is surely wilson the difﬁculty of distingui shing the voices is naturally

willing to learn the same lesson over and over letting patience have her perfect work that the ﬁve songs are really distinguishable is well illustrated by the fact which i have before mentioned that the presence of the alice thrush in new england during the breeding season was announced probable by myself simply on the strength of song which i had heard in the white mountains and which i believed must be his notw ithstanding i was entirely unacquainted with it and though all our books afﬁrmed that the alice thrush was not summer resident of any part of the united states it is worth remarking also in this conn ection that the hylocichlæ differ more decidedly in their notes of alarm than in their songs the wood thrush call is extremely sharp and brusque and is usually ﬁred off in little volley that of the wilson is sort of whine or snarl in distressing contrast with his song the hermit is quick sotto voce sometimes almost inaudible chuck the swainson is mellow whistle while that of the alice is something between the swainson and the wilson so gentle and reﬁned the former nor so outrageously vulgar the latter in what is here said about discriminating species it must be understood that i am not speaking of such identiﬁcation will answer strictly scientiﬁc purpose that the bird must be shot to the maiden this decree will doubt sound cruel men who pass laws of that sort may call themselves ornithologists if they will her part she calls them butchers we might turn on our fair accuser it is true with some inquiry about the two or three which adorn her bonnet but that would be only giving one more proof of our heartlessness and besides unless man is downright angry he can scarcely feel that he has really cleared himself when he has done nothing more than to point the ﬁnger and say you another however i am not set the defence of ornithologists they are abundantly able to take care of themselves without the help of any outsider i only declare that even to my unprofessional eye this rule of theirs seems wise and necessary they know if their critics not how easy it is to be deceived how many times things have been seen and minutely described which was afterwards established could not by any possibility have been visible moreover regret it we may it is clear that in this world nobody can escape giving and taking more or less pain we of the sterne r sex are accustomed to think that even our censors are not entirely innocent in this regard albeit myself i am bound to believe that generally they are not to blame the tortures they inﬂict upon us granting the righteousness of the scien tist caution however we may still ﬁnd less rigorous code sufﬁcient our own though i hope not unscientiﬁc purpose it is certain that great enjoyment of bird study is possible some of us if we are never to be allowed to call our gentle friends by name until in every case we have gone through the formality of examination practically and ends we may know robin or redstart or even hermit thrush when we see him without ﬁrst turning the bird into specimen probably there are none of our birds which afford more surprise and pleasure to novice than the family of warblers ornithologist has related how one day he wandered into the forest in an idle mood and accidentally catching gleam of bright color overhead raised his gun and brought the bird to his feet and how excited and charmed he was with the wondrous beauty of his little trophy were there other birds in the woods lovely this he would see himself and that was the beginning of what bids fair to prove enthusiasm warblers are credited to new england but it would be safe to say that not more than three of them are known to the average how should he know them indeed they not come about the ﬂower like the humming nor pg 142 whose light blue eyes are tender over drowning ﬂies pg 143 pg 144 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https the lawn like the robin neither can they be hunted with dog like the grouse and the woodcock hence all their gorgeous apparel they are mainly left to students and collectors of our common species the most beautiful are perhaps the blue the blue the blackburnian the the canada ﬂyca tcher and the redstart with the the green the prairie warbler the summer and the maryland coming not far behind but all of them are beautiful and they possess besides the charm of great diversity of plumage and habits while some of them have the further merit by means inconsiderable of being rare it was bright day when the blue warbler settled in my neighborhood on my morning walk i detected new song and following it up found new bird result which is far from being thing of course the spring migr ation was at its height and at ﬁrst i expected to have the pleasure of my new friend society only day or two so i made the most of it but it turned out that he and his companion had come to spend the summer and before very long i discovered their nest this was still unﬁnished when i came upon it but i knew pretty well whose it was having several times noticed the birds about the spot and few days afterwards the female bravely sat still while i bent over her admiring her courage and her handsome dress i paid my respects to the little mother almost daily but jealously guarded her secret sharing it only with woman whom i took with on one of my visits but alas one day i called only to ﬁnd the nest empty whether the villain who pillaged it traveled on two legs or on four i never knew possibly he dropped out of the air but i wished him good whoever he was next year the birds appeared again and more than one pair of them but nest could i ﬁnd though i often looked it and children say in their games was sometimes very warm is there any lover of birds in whose mind certain birds and certain places are not indissolubly joined most of us i am sure could go over the list and name the exact spots where we ﬁrst saw this one where we ﬁrst heard that one sing and where we found our ﬁrst nest of the other there is piece of swampy woodland in jefferson new hampshire midway between the hotels and the railway station which will always be associated with the song of the winter wren i had been making an attempt to explore the wood with view to its botanical treasures but the mosquitoes had rallied with such spirit that i was glad to beat retreat to the road just then an unseen bird broke out into song and by the time he had ﬁnished i was saying to myself winter wren now if i could only see him in the act and so be sure of the correctness of my guess i worked to that end cautiously possible but all to purpose and ﬁnally i started abruptly toward the spot whence the sound had come expecting to see the bird ﬂy but apparently there was bird there and i stood still in little perplexity then all at once the wren appeared hopping about among the dead branches within few yards of my feet and peering at the intruder with evident curiosity and the next mome nt he was joined by hermit thrush equally inquisitive both were silent dead men but plainly had doubt whatever that they were in their own domain and that it belonged to the other party to move away i presumed that the thrush at least had nest not far off but after little search the mosquitoes were still active i concluded not to intrude further on his domestic privacy i had heard the wren famous song and it had not been praised but then came the inevitable second thought had i really heard it true the music possessed the wren characteristics and winter wren was in the brush but what proof had i that the bird and the song belonged together i must see him in the act of singing but this i found was more easily said than done in jefferson in gorham in the franconia notch in short wherever i went there was difﬁculty about hearing the music and little about seeing the wren but it was provoking that eye and ear could never be brought to bear witness to the same bird however this difﬁculty was not insuperable and after it was once overcome i was in the habit of witnessing the whole performance almost often i wished of similar interest to is turn in an old massachusetts road over which boy and man i have traveled hundreds of times one of those delightful half road and half pg 145 pg 146 pg 147 pg 148 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https where the grass grows between the and the while bushes usurp what ought to be the sidewalk here one morning in the time when every day was disclosing two or three new species my delight i stopped to listen to some bird of quite unsuspected identity who was calling and singing and scolding in the indian brier thicket making in truth prodigious racket i twisted and turned and was not little astonished when at last i detected the author of all this outcry from study of the manual i set him down probably the vireo conjecture whic h further investigation conﬁrmed this vireo is the very prince of loud and sarcastic is well called the politician though it is disappointment to learn that the title was given him not his eloquence but on account of his habit of putting pieces of newspaper into his nest while i stood peering into the thicket man whom i knew came along the road and caught thus disreputably employed without doubt he thought lazy or possibly being more charitable he said to himself poor fellow he losing his mind take gun on your shoulder and go wandering about the woods all day long and you will be looked upon with respect matter though you kill nothing bigger than chipmunk or stand by the hour at the end of catching nothing but and your neighbors will think ill of you but to be seen staring at bird ﬁve minutes together or picking roadside weeds it is fortunate there are asylums the crazy not unlikely the malady will grow upon him and who knows how soon he may become dangerous some thing must be wrong about that to which we are unaccustomed blowing out the brains of rabbits and squirrels is an innocent and delightful pastime everybody knows and the delectable excitement of pulling grown ﬁshes out of the pond to perish miserably on the bank that too is recreation easily enough appreciated but what shall be said of enjoying birds without killing them or of taking pleasure in plants which so far we know can not suffer even if we kill them of my many pleasant associations of birds with places one of the pleasantest is connected with the woodpecker this showy bird has good many years been very rare in massachusetts and therefore when during the freshness of my ornithological researches i went to washington month visit it was one of the things which i had especially in mind to make his acquaintance but i looked him without success till at the end of fortnight i made pilgrimage to mount vernon here after visiting the grave and going over the house every visitor does i sauntered about the grounds thinking of the great man who used to the same so many years before but all the while keeping my eyes open the present feathered inhabitants of the sacred spot soon bird dashed by and struck against the trunk of an adjacent tree and glancing up quickly i beheld my sought woodpecker how appropriately patriotic he looked at the home of washington wearing the nation al colors white and blue after this he became abundant about the capital so that i saw him often and took much pleasure in his frolicsome ways and some years later he suddenly appeared in force in the vicinity of boston where he remained through the winter months to my thought none the less he will always suggest mount vernon indeed although he is certainly rather jovial and even giddy he is to the bird of washington much more truly than is the solemn eagle who commonly bears that name to go away from home even if the journey be longer than from massachusetts to the district of columbia is sure to prove an event of small interest to young naturalist and this visit of mine to the national capital was exception on the afternoon of my arrival walking up seventh street i heard series of loud clear monotonous whistles which i had then leisure to investigate but the author of which i promised myself the satisfaction of meeting at another time in fact i think it was at least fortnight before i learned that these whistles came from the tufted titmouse i had been seeing him almost daily but till then he had never chanced to use that particular note while under my eye pg 149 pg 150 pg 151 pg 152 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https was certain tract of country woodland and pasture over which i roamed good many times and which is still clearly mapped out in my memory here i found my ﬁrst carolina or mocking wren who ran in at one side of woodpile and came out at the other i drew near and who day or two afterwards sang so loudly from an oak tree that i ransacked it with my eye in search of some large bird and was confounded when ﬁnally i discovered who the musician really was here every day were to be heard the glorious song of the cardinal grosbeak the effort of the gnatcatcher and the rigmarole of the chat on wooded hillside where grew profusion of trailing arbutus pink azalea and violets the rowdyish ﬂycatchers were screaming in the in this same grove i twice saw the rare woodpecker who on both occasions after rapping smartly with his beak turned his head and laid his ear against the trunk evidently listening to see whether his alarm had set any grub near by in an under growth i fell in with few warblers they seemed of peculiarly unsuspicious turn of mind and certainly wore the quaintest of i must mention also scarlet tanager who all aﬁre he was one day alighted in bush of ﬂowering dogwood which was completely covered with its large white blossoms probably he had idea how well his perch became him perhaps i ought to be ashamed to confess it but though i went several times into the galleries of our honorable senate and house of representatives and heard speeches by some celebrated men including at least half dozen candidates the presidency yet after all the congressmen in feathers interested most i thought indeed that the chat might well enough have been elected to the lower house his volubility and waggish manners would have made him quite at home in that assembly while his waistcoat would have given him an agreeable conspicuity but to be sure he would have needed to learn the use of tobacco well all this was only few years ago but the men whose eloquence then drew the crowd to the capitol are many of them heard there longer some are dead some have retired to private life but the birds never die every spring they come trooping back their session the still ﬂoats majestically over the city the chat still practices his lofty tumbling in the suburban pastures snarling and scolding at all comers the ﬂowing potomac still yields blameless sport to the and the kingﬁsher the orchard oriole continues to whistle in front of the agricultural department and the crow blackbird to parade back and forth over the smithsonian lawns presidents and senators may come and go be praised and viliﬁed and then in turn forgotten but the birds are subject to such mutations it is foolish thought but sometimes their happy carelessness seems the better part minor songsters minor songsters among those of us who are in the habit of attending to there can hardly be anybody i think who has not

associations we heard the singer ﬁrst in some uncommonly romantic spot or when we were in mood of unusual sensibility and in greater or less degree the charm of that hour is always renewed us with the repetition of the song or if may be who will assert the contrary that there is some occult relation between the bird mind and our own or once more something may be due to the natura l pleasure which amiable people take and all lovers of birds may be supposed priori to belong to that class in paying peculiar honor to merit which the world at large less discriminating than they has thus far failed to recognize and in which therefore by right of discovery they have sort of propriet ary interest this at least is evident our preference is not determined altogether by the intrinsic worth of the song the mind is active not passive and gives to the music something from itself the consecr ation and the poet dream furthermore it is to be said that bird less than be wanting in that fullness and scope of voice and that large measure of technical skill which are absolutely essential to the great artist properly so called and yet within his own limitations may be competent to please even the most fastidious ear it is with birds with other poets the smaller gift need not be the less genuine and they whom the world calls greatest and whom we ourselves most admire may possibly not be the ones who touch us most intimately or to whom we return oftenest and with most delight this may be well illustrated by compa rison of the chickadee with the brown thrush the thrush or he is sometimes profanely styled the thrasher is the most pretentious perhaps i ought to say the greatest of new england songsters if we rule out the who is so very rare with us scarcely to come into the competition and still in my opinion his singing seldom produces the effect of really ﬁne music with all his ability which is nothing short of marvelous his taste is so deplorably uncertain and his passion so often becomes downright frenzy that the excited listene r hardly knowing what to think laughs and shouts bravo by turns something must be amiss certainly when the deepest feelings of the heart are poured forth in manner to suggest the performance of buffo the chickadee on the other hand seldom gets mention singer probably he never looked upon himself such you will not ﬁnd him posing at the top of tree challenging the world to listen and admire but he hops from twig to twig in quest of insects eggs and other dainties his merry spirits are all the time bubbling over in little chirps and twitters with now and then chickadee dee or hear hear every least syllable of which is like the very sound of happy thoughts my part i rate such triﬂes with the best of all good music and feel that we can not be grateful enough to the brave tit who furnishes us with them the twelve months of every year so far the chickadee is concerned i see nothing whatever to wish different but am glad to believe that my day and long after he will remain the same unassuming creature that he now is if i may be allowed the paradox it would be too bad him to change even the better but the bluebird who like the titmouse is hardly to be accounted musician does seem to be somewhat blameworthy once in while it is true he takes perch and sings but the most part he is contented with few simple notes having semblan ce of tune possibly he holds that his pure contralto voice i not remember ever to have heard from him any note of soprano or even of quality ought by itself to be sufﬁcient distinction but i think it likelier that his slight attempt at music is only one manifestation of the habitu al reserve which more than anything else perhaps may be said to characterize him how differently he and the robin impress us in this particular both take up their abode in our and orchards the bluebird goes so far indeed to accept our hospitality outright building his nest in boxes put up his accommodation and making the roofs of our houses his favorite perching stations but while the robin is noisily and jauntily familiar the bluebird maintains digniﬁed aloofness coming and going about the premises but keeping his thoughts to himself and never becoming one of us save by the mere accident of local proximity the robin again loves to travel in large ﬂocks when household duties are over the season but although the same has been reported of the bluebird i have never myself seen such thing and am satisﬁed that rule this pg 158 pg 159 pg 160 pg 161 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https spirit ﬁnds family party of six or seven company enough his reticence we cheerfully admit is nothing to quarre l with it is all and not in the least unkindly in fact we like it on the whole rather better than the robin pertness and garrulity but none the less its natural consequence is that the bird has small concern musical display when he sings it is not to gain applause but to express his affection and while in one aspect of the case there is nothing out of the way in this his affection need not be the less deep and true because it is told in few words and with unadorned phrase i said to begin with it is hard not to feel that the world is being defrauded when any reason however amiable the possessor of such matchless voice has ambition to make the most of it it is always double pleasure to ﬁnd plodding man with poet heart in his breast and little of the same delighted surprise is felt by every one i imagine when he learns the ﬁrst time that our little brown creeper is singer what life could possibly be more prosaic than his day after day year in and out he creeps up one after another pausing only to peer right and left into the crevices of the bark in search of microscopic tidbits most irksome sameness surely how the poor fellow must envy the swallows who live on the wing and it were have their home in heaven so it is easy us to think but i doubt whether the creeper himself is troubled with such suggestions he seems to say the least well contented the most of us and what is more i am inclined to doubt whether any except free moral agents like ourselves are ever wicked enough to ﬁnd fault with the orderings of divine providence i fancy too that we may have exaggerated the monotony of the creeper lot it can scarcely be that even his days are without their occasional pleasurable excitements after good many trees which yield little or nothing his pains he must now and then light upon one which is like canaan after the wilderness land ﬂowing with milk and honey indeed the longer i think of it the more conﬁdent i feel that every aged creeper must have had sundry experiences of this sort which he is never weary of recounting the ediﬁcation of his nephews and nieces who of course are far too young to have anything like the wide knowledge of the world which their venerable uncle possesses certhia works all day his daily bread and yet even of him it is true that the life is more than meat he has his inward joys his affectionate deligh ts which outward infelicity can touch bird who thinks nothing of staying by his nest and his mate at the sacriﬁce of his life is not to be written down dullard or drudg merely because his dress is plain and his occupation unromantic he has right to sing he has something within him to inspire the strain there are descriptions of the creeper music which liken it to wren i am sorry that i have myself heard it only on one occasion then however so far was it from being like that it might rather have been the work of one of the less proﬁcient warblers somewhat long opening note followed by hurried series of shorter ones the whole given in sharp thin voice and havin g nothing to recommend it to notice considered simply music all the while the bird kept on industriously with his journey up the tree and it is not in the least unlikely that he may have another and better song which he reserves times of more leisure 19 our american are all to be classed among the minor songsters standing in this respect in strong contrast with the true old world warblers of whose musical capacity enough perhaps is said when it is mentioned that the nightingale is one of them but comparisons apart our birds are by means to be despised and not few of their songs have good degree of merit that of the summer may be taken fairly representative of the entire group being neither one of the best nor one of the poorest he i have noticed is given to singing late in the day three of the new england species have at the same time remarkably rough voices and black throats mean the blue the green and the blue seeing that the ﬁrst two are of the genus dendrœca while the last is helminthophaga i have allowed myself to query half in earnest whether they may not possibly be more nearly related than the systematists have yet discovered several of the warbler songs are extremely odd the blue example is brief hoarse upward run pg 162 pg 163 pg 164 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https of scale exercise and if the practice of such things be really beneﬁcial music teachers afﬁrm it would seem that this little beauty must in time become vocalist of the ﬁrst order nearly the same might be said of the prairie warbler but his étude is little longer and less hurried besides being in higher key i not call to mind any bird who sings downward scale having before spoken of the tendency of warblers to learn two or even three set tunes i was the more interested when last summer i added another to my list of the species which aspire to this kind of liberal education it was on the side of mount clinton that i heard two blackburnians both in full sight and within few rods of each other who were singing two entirely distinct songs one of is the common one i quaintly with three or four short notes like zip zip zip while the other was not unlike fraction of the winter wren melody those who are familiar with the latter bird will perhaps recognize the phrase referred to if i call it the willie willie winkie triple accent on the ﬁrst syllable of the last word most of the songs of this family are rather slight but the extremest case known to is that of the dendrœca striata whose zee zee zee is almost ridiculously faint you may hear it continually in the higher spruce forests of the white mountains but you will look good many times before you discover its author and not improbably will begin by taking it the call of the kinglet the music of the warbler is similar to the poll but hardly so weak and formless it seems reasonable to believe not only that these two species are descended from common ancestry but that the diver gence is of comparatively recent date even now the young of the year can be distinguished only with great difﬁculty although the birds in full feather are clearly enough marked warblers songs are often made up of two distinct portions one given deliberately the other hurriedly and with concluding ﬂourish indeed the same may be said of songs generally of the song sparrow the bunting and the wood thrush being familiar examples yet there are many singers who attempt climax of this sort but make their music to consist of two or three or more parts all alike the maryland instance cries out over and over what pity what pity what pity so at least he seems to say though i confess it is more than likely i mistake the words since the fellow never appears to be feeling badly but on the contrary delivers his message with an air of cordial satisfaction the song of the creeping warbler is after still another fashion simple short trill it is musical and sweet the more so coming almost always out of the vireos or greenlets are akin to the warblers in appearance and habits and like them are peculiar to the western continent we have birds that are more unsparing of their music prodigality is one of the american virtues we are told they sing from morning till night of them at thus till the very end of the season it is worth mentioning however that the makes short day becoming silent just at the time when the generality of birds grow most noisy probably the same is true of the rest of the family but on that point i am not prepared to speak with positiveness of the ﬁve new england species i omit the greenlet never having been fortunate enough to know him the is decidedly the most ambitious the warbling and the solitary are the most pleasing while the and the are very much alike and both of them rather too monotonous and persistent it is hard sometimes not to get out of patience with the ceaseless and noisy iteration of his trite theme especially if you are doing your utmost to catch the notes of some rarer and more reﬁned songster in my i ﬁnd an entry describing my vain attempts to enjoy the music of grosbeak at that time had never been common bird with pesky wagnerian kept up an incessant racket the warbling vireo is admirably name d there is one of our birds that can more properly be said to warble he keeps further from the ground than the others and shows strong preference the elms of village streets out of which his delicious music drops upon the ears of all passers underneath how many of them hear it and thank the singer is unhappily another question pg 165 pg 166 pg 167 pg 168 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https solitary vireo may once in while be heard in roadside tree chanting familiarly any but he is much less abundant than the latter and rule more retiring his ordinary song is like the and the except that it is pitched somewhat higher and has peculia r inﬂection or cadence which on sufﬁcient acquaintance becomes quite unmistakab le this however is only the smallest part of his musical gift one morning in may while strolling through piece of thick woods i came upon bird of this species who all alone like myself was hopping from one low branch to another and every now and then breaking out into kind of soliloquizing song musical chatter shifting suddenly to an intricate warble later in the same day i found another in chestnut grove this last was in state of quite unwonted fervor and sang almost continuously now in the usual disconnected vireo manner and now with chatter and warble like what i had heard in the morning but louder and longer his best efforts ended abruptly with the ordinary vireo call and the instantaneous change of voice gave to the whole very strange effect the chatter and warble appeared to be related to each other precisely are those of the kinglet while the warble had certain tender affectionate some would say plaintive quality which at once put in mind of the goldﬁnch i have seldom been more charmed with the song of any bird than i was on the 7th of last october with that of this same vireo solitarius the morning was bright and warm but the birds had nearly all taken their departure and the few that remained were silent suddenly the stillness was broken by vireo note and i said to myself with surprise listening again however i detected the solitary inﬂection and after few moments the bird in the most obliging manner came directly towards and began to warble in the fashion already described he sang and sang if his song could have ending mean while was ﬂitting from tree to tree inten t upon his breakfast far i could discover he was without company and his music too seemed to be nothing more than an unpremeditated talking to himself wonderfully sweet it was and full of the happiest content i listened till i had my ﬁll and returned the favor best i could by hoping that the little wayfarer lightsome mood would not fail him all the way to guatemala and back again exactly month before this and not far from the same spot i had stood some minutes to enjoy the recital of the solitary saucy cousin the even at that time although the woods were swarming with birds of them travelers from the north was nearly the only one still in song he however was fairly brimming over with music changing his tune again and again and introducing the ﬁrst time in weymouth concert programmes say notably ﬁne shake like the solitary he was all the while busily feeding birds in general and vireos in particular hold with browning that we may prove our work the better the sweetness of our song and one while was exploring ood bush plainly without the slightest fear of any it occurred to that possibly it is our fault and not that of rhus venenata when we suf fer from the touch of that graceful shrub the greenlet is vocalist of such extraordinary versatility and powe r that one feels almost guilty in speaking of him under the title which stands at the head of this paper how he would scold carlyle if he knew what were going on nevertheless i can not rank him with the great singers exceptionally clever and original beyond all dispute he is and that matter i look upon the solitary very much his superior in spite shall i say because of latter greater simplicity and reserve but if we hesitate thus about these two inconspicuous vireos whom half of those who them the honor to read what is here said about them will have never seen how are we to deal with the scarlet tanager our handsomest bird and with musical aspirations well shall we put him into the second class it must be so i fear yet such justice is trial to the ﬂesh what critic could ever quite leave out of account the beauty of prima donna in passing judgment on her work does not her angelic face sing to his eye emerson says pg 169 pg 170 pg 171 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https i gave the tanager credit only one song one which suggests robin laboring under an attack of hoarseness but i have discovered that he himself regards his of equal value at least i have found him perched at the tip of tall pine and repeating this inconsiderable and not very melodious trochee with all earnestness and perseverance sometimes he rehearses it thus at nightfall but even so i can not call it highly artistic i am glad to believe however that he does not care in the least my opinion why should he he is too true gallant to mind what anybody else thinks so long one is pleased and she doubt tells him every day that he is the best singer in the grove beside his divine the rhapsody of the wood thrush is mere nothing if she is to be the judge strange indeed that so shabbily dressed creature this thrush should have the presumption to attempt to sing at all but then she charitably adds perhaps he is not to blame such things come by nature and there are some birds you know who can not tell the dif ference between noise and music we trust that the tanager will improve time goes on but in any case we are largely in his debt how we should miss him if he were gone or even were become rare the summer and the cardinal are in our latitude it is he lights up our northern woods with truly tropical splendor the like of which other of our birds can furnish let us hold him in hearty esteem and pray that he may never be exterminated not even to beautify the of our ladies who if they only knew it are already sufﬁciently bewitching what shall we say now about the lesse r lights of that most musical family the ﬁnches of course the cardinal and grosbeaks are not to be included in any such category nor will i put there the goldﬁnch the linnet the sparrow and the song sparrow these if more shall stand among the immortals so far at any rate my suffrage counts but who ever dreamed of calling the chipping sparrow ﬁne singer and yet who that knows it does not love his earnest trill dry and tuneless it is i can speak one at all events and he always has an ear open it by the middle of april it is the voice of friend friend so true and gentle and conﬁding that we not care to ask whether his voice be smooth and his speech eloquent the chipper congener the ﬁeld sparro w is less neighborly than he but much better musician his song is simplicity itself yet even at its lowest estate it never fails of being truly melodious while by one means and another its wise little author contrives to impart to it very considerable variety albeit within pretty narrow limits last spring the ﬁeld sparrows were singing constantly from the middle of april till about the 10th of may when they became entirely dumb then after week in which i heard not note they again grew musical i pondered not little over their silence but concluded that they were just then very much occupied with preparations housekeeping the bird who is called indiscriminately the grass ﬁnch the bunting the winged sparrow the vesper sparrow and i know not what else the ornithologists have nicknamed him poœcetes gramineus is singer of good parts but is especially to be commended his reﬁnement in form his music is strikingly like the song sparrow but the voice is not so loud and ringing and the two or three opening notes are less sharply emphasized in general the difference between the two songs may perhaps be well expressed by saying that the one is more declamatory the other more cantabile difference exactly such we might have expected considering the nervous impetuous disposition of the song sparrow and the placidity of the one of his titles indicates the is famous singing in the evening when of course his efforts are doubly acceptab le and i can readily believe that minot is correct in his impression that he has once or twice heard the song in the night while spending few days at new hampshire hotel which was surrounded with ﬁne lawns such the grass ﬁnch delights in i happened to be awake in the morning long before sunrise in fact it seemed like the dead of night one or two of these sparrows were piping freely the sweet and gentle strain had the whole mountain valley to itself how beautiful it was set in such broad mar gin of silence i must leave to be pg 172 pg 173 pg 174 pg 175 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https i noticed moreover that the birds sang almost incessantly the whole day through much of the time there were two singing antiphonally manifestly the lines had fallen to them in pleasant places at home the summer in those

bills happy commoners indeed their songs in the night seemed nowise surprising i fancied that i could be happy myself in such case our familiar and known in some quarters the black and often called the black has long trill not altogether unlike the common chipper but in much higher key it is modest lay yet doubtless full of meaning the singer takes to the very tip of tree and throws his head back in the most approved style he does his best at any rate and so far ranks with the angels while if my testimony can be of any service to him i am glad to say is too bad the praise is so equivocal that i have heard many human singers who gave less pleasure and further that he took an indispensable though subordinate part in what was one of the most memorable concerts at which i was ever happy enough to be listener this was given some years ago in an old by ﬂock of sparro ws who perhaps that occasion only had the valuable assistance of large choir of birds the latter were twittering in every tree while to this goodly accompaniment the sparrows were singing their loud clear song the combination was felicitous in the extreme i would go long way to hear the like again if distinction can not be attained by one means who knows but that it may be by another it is denied us to be great very well we can at least try the effect of little originality something like this seems to be the philosophy of the and he carries it out both in dress and in song we have said already it is usual birds to reserve the loudest and most taking parts of their music the close though it may be doubted whether they have any intelligent purpose in so doing indeed the apprehension of great general truth such lies at the basis of this universal habit truth namely that everything depends upon the impression ﬁnally left on the hearer mind that to end with some grand burst or with some surprisingly lofty note is the only or to speak cautiously the principal requisite to really great musical performance intelligent grasp of such truth this i say seems to to lie beyond the measure of bird capacity in the present stage of his development be this it may however it is noteworthy that the exactly reverses the common plan he begins at his loudest and sprightliest and then runs off into diminuendo which fades into silence almost imperceptibly the strain will never be renowned its beauty but it is unique and further is continued well into august moreover this adds grace to the most ordinary song is often let fall while the bird is on the wing this eccentric genius has taken possessi on of certain hillside pasture which in another way belongs to also year after year he comes back and settles down upon it about the middle of may and i have often been amused to see his is not permitted to wear single blue out of her nest in barberry bush and go ﬂuttering off both wings dragging helplessly through the grass i should pity her profoundly but that i am in doubt her injuries will rapidly heal when once i am out of sight besides i like to imagine her beatitude ﬁve minutes afterward she sits again upon the nest with her heart treasures all safe underneath her many time was boy of my acquaintance comforted in some ache or pain with the words never mind will feel better when it gets well and so sure enough it always did but what wicked world this is where nature teaches even bird to play the deceiver on the same hillside is always to be found the chewink creature whose dress and song are so unlike those of the rest of his tribe that the irreverent amateur is tempted to believe that once the men of science have made mistake what has any ﬁnch to with call like cherawink or with such harlequin suit but it is unsafe to judge according to the outward appearance in ornithology in other matters and i have pg 176 pg 177 pg 178 pg 179 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https that it is only those who are foolish well ignorant who indulge in criticisms of wiser men conclusions so let us call the towhee ﬁnch and say more about it but whatever his lineage it is plain that the chewink is not bird to be governed very strictly by the traditions of the fathers his usual song is characteristic and pretty yet he is so far from being satisﬁed with it that he varies it continually and in many ways some of them sadly puzzling to the student who is set upon telling all the birds by their voices i remember well enough the morning i was inveigled through the wet grass of two that just i was shod the wonderfully foreign note which ﬁlled with lively anticipations of new bird but which turned out to be the work of most towhee it was perhaps this same bird or his brother whom i one day heard throwing in between his customary cherawinks profusion of staccato notes of widely varying pitch together with little volleys of tinkling sounds such his song concludes with this medley was not laughable like the chat which it suggested but it had the same abrupt fragmentary and promiscuous character all in all it was what i never should have expected from this paragon of i have elsewhere said is pipilo strong point one afternoon last summer young friend and i found ourselves we suspected near chewink nest and at once set out to see which of us should have the honor of the discovery we searched diligently but without avail while the father sat quietly in tree calling with all sweetness and with never trace of anger or trepidation cherawink cherawink finally we gave over the hunt and i began to console my companion and myself our disappointment by shaking in the face of the bird small tree which very conveniently leaned toward the one in which he was perched by rather vigorous efforts i could make this pass back and forth within few inches of his bill but he utterly disdained to notice it and kept on calling before while we were laughing at his impudence his impudence the mother suddenly appeared with an insect in her beak and joined her voice to her husband i was just decla ring how cruel well useless it was us to stay when she ungratefully gave ludicrous turn to what was intended very sage and considerate remark by dropping almost at my feet stepping upon the edge of her nest and offering the morsel to one of her young we watched the little tableau admiringly i had never seen prettier show of nonchalance and thanked our stars that we had been saved from an involuntary slaughter of the innocents while trampling all about the spot the nest which we had tried so hard to ﬁnd was in plain sight concealed only by the perfect agreement of its color with that of the dead in the midst of which it was placed the shrewd birds had somehow experience perhaps like those who would escape disagreeable and perilous conspic uity must conform closely possible to the world around them according to my observation the towhee is not much given to singing after july but he keeps up his call which is little less musical than his song till his departure in late september at that time of the year the birds collect together in their favorite haunts and i remember my dog running into the edge of roadside pasture among some cedar trees when there broke out such chorus of cherawinks that i was instantly reminded of swamp full of frogs in april after the tanager the baltimore oriole named lord baltimore whose colors he wears is probably the most gorgeous he is certainly one of the best known of new england birds he has discovered that men bad they are are less to be dreaded than hawks and weasels and so after making sure that his wife is not subject to he swings his nest boldly from swaying branch in full view of whoever may choose to look at it some morning in far from the will wake to hear him ﬁﬁng in the elm before your window he has come in the night and is already making himself at home once i saw pair who on the very ﬁrst morning had begun to get together materials nest his whistle is one of the clearest and loudest but he makes little pretensions to music i have been pleased and interested however to see how tuneful he becomes in august after most other birds have ceased to sing and after pg 180 pg 181 pg 182 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https interval of silence on his own part early and late he pipes and chatters if he imagined that the spring were really coming back again forthwith what the explanation of this lyrical revival may be i have never been able to gather but the fact itself is very noticeable so that it would not be amiss to call the golden robin the bird of august the oriole dusky relatives have the organs of song well developed and although most of the species have altogether lost the art of music there are none of them even now that not betray more or less of the musical impulse the blackbird indeed has some really praiseworthy notes and to personal reasons quite aside from any question about

to take things we ﬁnd them throwing criticism to the winds having said which i am bound to go further still and to acknowledge that on looking back over the ﬁrst part of this paper i feel more than half ashamed of the strictures therein passed upon the bluebird and the brown thrush when i heard the former salutation from boston common elm on the morning of the 22d of february last i said to myself that music not even the nightingale could ever be sweeter let him keep on by all means in his own artless way paying heed to what i have foolishly written about his shortcomings the thrasher gutturals i recall that even in the symphonies of the greatest of masters there are here and there quaint bassoon phrases which have and doubtless were intended to have somewhat whimsical effect and

musical undulations and then drop down again to ﬁnish their repast and i perceive that in spite of its unsightliness the chicory is not weed use has been discovered in truth the lover of birds soon

places within the range of his walks where thanks to somebody shiftlessness perhaps they have been allowed to ﬂourish it is not many years since there were several such winter gardens of the birds in commonwealth avenue overgrown with tall weeds hither cause ﬂocks of goldﬁnches linnets and snow buntings and thither i went to watch them it happened i remember that the last two species which are not to be met with in this region every season were unusuall y abundant during the ﬁrst or second year of my ornithological enthusiasm great was the delight with which i added them to the small but rapidly increasing list of my feathered acquaintances the and the goldﬁnches often travel together or at least are often to be found feeding in company and they resemble each other good deal in size general appearance and ways the casual observer is very likely not to discriminate between them only the summer before the time of which i speak i had spent vacation at mount wachusett and resident of princeton noticing my attention to the birds taste so peculiar is not easily concealed had one day sought an interview with to inquire whether the did not remain in massachusetts through the winter i explained that we had two birds which commonly went by that name and asked whether he meant the one with black forehead and black wings and tail yes he said that was the one i assured him of course that this bird the goldﬁnch did stay with us all the year round and that whoever had informed him to the contrary must have understood him to be speaking about the golden warbler he expressed his gratiﬁcation but declared that he pg 188 pg 189 pg 190 pg 191 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https really entertained doubt of the fact himself he had often seen the birds on the mountain when he had been cutting wood there in midwinter at such times he added they were very tame and would come about his feet to pick up crumbs while he was eating his dinner then he went on to tell that at that season of the year their plumage took on more or less of reddish tinge he had seen in the same ﬂock some with trace of red others that were slightly touched with it and others still of really bright color at this i had nothing to say save that his red birds whatever else they were could not have been goldﬁnches but next winter when i saw the and the linnets feeding together in commonwealth avenue i thought at once of my wachusett friend here was the very scene he had so faithfully described of the ﬂock with red at all some with red crowns and few with bright carmine crowns and breasts they remained all winter and doubt thought the farmers of boston very good and wise set to cultivate the evening primrose so extensively this plant like the succory is of an ungraceful aspect yet it has sweet and beautiful blossoms and an herb bearing seed is in the front rank i doubt whether we have any that surpass it the birds being judges many stories are told of the fearlessness and ready reconciliation to captivity well of their constancy to each other i have myself stood still in the midst of ﬂock until they were feeding round my feet so closely that it looked easy enough to catch one or two of them with butterﬂy net strange that creatures so gentle and seemingly so delicately organized should choose to live in the regions about the north pole why should they prefer labrador and greenland iceland and spitzber gen to more southern countries why well possibly worse reason than this that these are the lands of their fathers other birds it may be have grown discouraged and one after another ceased to come back to their native shores the rigors of the climate have increased but these little patriots are still faithful spitzber gen is home and every spring they make the long and dangerous passage to it all praise to them if any be ready to call this an deeming it incredible that beings so small and lowly should come so near to human sentiment and virtue let such not be too hasty with their dissent surely they may in reason wait till they can point to at least one country where the men are universally faithful to their wives and children the birds are to theirs the linnets i have said are irregular visitors in this region several years may pass and not one be seen but the goldﬁnch we have with us always easily recognized he is there are many i fear who not know him even by sight yet when that distinguished ornithologist the duke of argyll comes to publish his impressions of this country he avers that he has been hardly more interested in the glories of niagara than in this same little which he saw the ﬁrst time while looking from his hotel window at the great cataract golden ﬁnch indeed he exclaims such tribute this from the pen of british nobleman ought to give astragalinus tristis immediate entrance into the very best of american society it is common to say that the goldﬁnches wander about the country during the winter undoubtedly this is true in measure but i have seen things which lead to suspect that the statement is sometimes made too sweeping last winter example ﬂock took up their quarters in certain neglected piece of ground on the side of beacon street close upon the boundary between boston and brookline and remained there nearly or quite the whole season week after week i saw them in the same place accompanied always by half dozen tree sparrows they had found spot to their mind with plenty of succory and evening primrose and were wise enough not to forsake it any uncertainty the goldﬁnch loses his bright feathers and song the cold season approaches but not even new england winter can rob him of his sweet call and his cheerful spirits and one i think him never more winsome than when he bangs in graceful attitudes above on bleak january morning pg 192 pg 193 pg 194 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https we are of the society of the goldﬁnches and the at this time of the year we can not easily rid ourselves of degre of solicitude their comfort especially if we chance to come upon them after sunset on some bitterly cold day and mark with what nervous haste they snatch here and there seed making the utmost of the few remaining minutes of twilight they will go to bed hungry and cold we think and were surely better off in milder clime but if i am to judge from my own experience the snow buntings awaken such emotions arctic explorers by instinct they come to us only with real arctic weather and almost seem to be themselves part of the torm with which they arrive matter what they are doing running along the street before an approaching sleigh standing on wayside fence jumping up from the ground to snatch the stem of weed and then setting at work hurriedly to gather the seeds they have shaken down or best of all skimming over the snow in close order their white breasts catching the sun they veer this way or that they may be doing they are the most picturesque of all our birds in point of suspiciousness their behavior is very different at different times that matter is true of birds generally seeing the ﬂock alight in low roadside lot you steal silently to the edge of the sidewalk to look over upon them there they are sure enough walking and running about only few rods distant what lovely creatures and how prettily they walk but just you are wishing perhaps that they were little nearer they begin to ﬂy from right under your feet you search the ground eagerly right and left but not bird can you discover and still they continue to start up now here now there till you are ready to question whether indeed eyes were made seeing the wear protective colors and like most other animals are of opinion that such lack the receipt of there is often nothing safer than to sit still the worse the weather the less timorous they are with them with wiser heads one thought drives out another and it is nothing uncommon when times are hard to see them stay quietly upon the fence while sleigh goes past or suffer foot passenger to come again and again within few yards it gives lively touch to the imaginat ion to overtake these beautiful strangers in the middle of beacon street particularly if one has lately been reading about them in some narrative of siberian travel coming from so far associating in ﬂocks with costumes so becoming and yet so unusual they might be expected to attract universal notice and possibly to get into the newspapers but there is fashion even about seeing and of thousand persons who may take sunday promenade over the while these tourists from the north pole are there it is doubtful whether dozen are aware of their presence birds feeding in the street yes yes english sparrows of course we have any other birds in boston nowadays you know with the pine grosbeaks the case is different when man sees company of rather large birds about the evergreens in his most of them of neutral tint but one or two in suits of he is pretty certain to feel at least momentary curiosity about them their slight advantage in size counts something without controversy the bigger the bird the more worthy he is of notice and then the bright color the very best men are yet but imperfectly civilized and there must be comparatively few even of bostonians in whom there is not some lingering susceptibility to the fascination of red feathers add to these things the fact that the grosbeaks are extremely conﬁding and much more likely than the buntings to be seen from the windows of the house and you have perhaps sufﬁcient explanation of the more general interest they excite like the snow buntings and the they roam over the higher latitudes of europe asia and america and make only irregular visits to our corner of the world 21 i can not boast of any intimate acquaintance with them i have never caught them in net or knocked them over with club other persons have done although i have seen them when their tameness promised success to any such loving experiment indeed it was several years before my lookout them was rewarded then one day i saw ﬂock of about ten ﬂy across beacon street the edge of brookline alight in an tree at which i forthwith clambered over the after them heedless alike of the deep snow and the surprise of any citizen who might chance to witness my proceeding some of the birds were feeding upon the rotten apples pg 195 pg 196 pg 197 pg 198 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https them off the tree and taking them to one of the large main branches or to the ground and there tearing them to pieces the sake of the seeds i suppose the rest sat still doing nothing i was most impressed with the exceeding mildness and placidity of their demeanor if they had time enough plenty to eat and nothing to fear their only notes were in quality much like the goldﬁnch and hardly louder but without his characteristic inﬂection i left the whole company seated idly in where to all appearance they proposed to observe the remainder of the day sabbath last winter the grosbeaks were uncommonly abundant i found number of them within few rods of the place just mentioned this time in evergreen trees and so near the road that i had call to commit trespass evergreens are their usual resort at least i gather from books i have seen them picking up provender from last year garden natives of the inhospitable north they have learned by long experience how to adapt themselves to circumstances if one resource fails there is always another to be tried let us hope that they even know how to show ﬁght upon occasion the purple small copy of the pine grosbeak the indigo bird is of the blue summer rather than winter bird with us yet he sometimes passes the cold season in eastern massachusetts and even in northern new hampshire i have never heard him sing more gloriously than once when the ground was deep under the snow wonderfully sweet and protrac ted warble poured out while the singer circled about in the air with kind of ﬂight i was walking briskly along west end street one cold morning in march i heard bird note close at hand and looking down discovered pair of these ﬁnches in front yard the male in bright plumage was ﬂitting about his mate calling anxiously while she poor thing sat motionless upon the snow too sick or too badly exhausted to ﬂy i stroked her feathers gently while she perched on my ﬁnger and then resumed my walk ﬁrst putting her into little more sheltered position on the sill of cellar window and promising to call on my way back when if she were better i would take her home with and give her warm room and good nursing when i returned however she was nowhere to be found her mate i regret to say both on his own account and the sake of the story had taken wing and disappeared the moment i entered the yard possibly he came back and encouraged her to ﬂy off with him or perhaps some cat made sunday breakfast of her the truth will never be known our vigilant city police take cognizance of tragedies so humble several years few song pair or two at wintered in piece of ground just beyond the junction of beacon street and brookline avenue i have grown accustomed to listen their tseep i go by the spot and occasionally i catch sight of one of them perched upon weed or diving under the plank sidewalk it would be pleasure to know the history of the colony how it started whether the birds are the same year after year i suppose to be the case and why this particular site was selected the lot is small with woods or bushy thicket near while it has buildings in one corner and is bounded on its three sides by the streets and the railway but it is full of rank growth of weeds especially sturdy species of aster and the evergreen and i suspect that the plank walk which on one side is raised some distance from the ground is found serviceable shelter in severe weath er it is certainly made to take the place of shrubbery purposes of concealment fortunately birds even those of the same species are not all exactly alike in their tastes and manner of life so while by far the greater part of our song sparrows leave us in the fall there are always some who prefer to stay they have strong local attachments perhaps or they dread the fatigue and peril of the journey or they were once incapacitated ﬂight when their companions went away and having found northern winter not so unendurable they had expected have since done from choice what at ﬁrst they did of necessity whatever their reasons we can not be presumed to have guessed half of them all events goodly number of song sparrows winter in massachusetts where they open the musical season before the ﬁrst of the migrants make pg 199 pg 200 pg 201 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https appearance i doubt however whether many of them choose camping grounds so exposed and public this in the rear of the house our only thrushes are the robins they may be found any time in favorable situations and even in so bleak place boston common i have seen them in every month of the year except february this exception moreover is more apparent than real the most matter of but hours since i once saw four birds in tree near the frog pond on the last day of january the house sparrows were much surprised i was at the sight and with characteristic urbanity gathered from far and near to sit in the same tree with the visitors and stare at them we can not help being grateful to the robins and the song sparrows who give us their society at so great cost but their presence can scarcely be thought to enliven the season at its best their bearing is only that of patient submission to the inevitable they remind us of the summer gone and the summer coming rather than brighten the winter that is now upon us like friends who commiserate us in some afﬂiction but are not able to comfort us how different the chickadee in the worst weather his greeting is never of condolence but of good cheer he has theory upon the subject probably he is shepherd of salisbury plain but he knows better than to waste the exhilarating air of this wild and frosty day in reminiscences of summer time it is couplet but rather incongruous he would think chickadee dee he calls chickadee dee and though the words have exact equivalent in english their meaning is felt by all such are worthy to hear them are the smallest birds really the most courageous or does an unconscious sympathy on our part inevitably give them odds in the comparison probably the latter supposition comes nearest the truth when sparrow chases butcher we cheer the sparrow and then when puts to ﬂight sparrow we cheer the we side with the kingbird against the crow and with the vireo against the kingbird it is noble trait of human we are somewhat too ready to boast of we like we say to see the little fellow at the top these remarks are made not with any reference to the chickadee admit possibility of exaggeration in his case leading to mention of the kinglet he is the least of all our winter birds and one of the most engaging emerson atom in full breath and scrap of valor would apply to him even better than to the titmouse he says little zee zee zee is nearly the limit of his vocabulary but his lively demeanor and the grace and agility of his movements are in themselves an excellent language speaking infallibly contented mind it is fact on which i forbear to moralize that birds seldom look unhappy except when they are idle his diminutive size attracts attention even from those who rarely notice such things about the ﬁrst of december year ago i was told of man who had shot bird only few days before in the vicinity of boston of course i expressed polite surprise and assured my informant that such remarkable capture ought by all means to be put on record in the auk every ornithologist in the land would be intere sted in it on this he called upon the lucky sportsman brother who happened to be standing by to corroborate the story yes the latter said the fact was had been stated but then he continued the bird did have long bill like and when i suggested that perhaps its crown was yellow bordered with black he said yes yes that the bird exactly so easy are startling discove ries to an observer who has just the requisite amount of knowledge and especially not too much the brown creeper is quite industrious and the kinglet but he is less taking in his personal appearance and less romantic in his mode of life the same may be said of our two woodpeckers the downy and the hairy while their more showy but less hardy relative the ﬂicker evidently feels the weather burden the creeper and these three woodpeckers are with us in limited numbers every winter and in pg 202 pg 203 thou hast morrow in thy song winter in thy year pg 204 pg 205 the project

and what was the occasion of their journey nobody could tell they arrived early in the autumn and went away with the exception of few stragglers in the spring and far i know have never been seen since it is great pity they did not like us well enough to come again they are entertaining creatures and gorgeously attired i used to watch them in the oak groves of some longwood estates but it was not till our second or third interview that i discovered them to be the authors of mystery over which i had been exercising my wits in vain note in winter one of their amusements was to drum on the tin girdles of the shade trees and meanwhile they themselves afforded pastime to the gray squirrels who were often to be seen creeping stealthily after them if they imagined that melanerpes erythr ocephalus might possibly be caught if only he were hunted long enough i laughed at them but after all their amusing hallucination was nothing but the sportsman instinct and life would soon lose its charm most of us sportsmen or not if we could longer pursue the unattainable probably my experience is not singula r but there are certain birds well known to be more or less abundant in this neighborhood which some reason or other i have seldom if ever met example of the multitude of pine ﬁnches which now and then overrun eastern massachusetts in winter i have never seen one while on the other hand i was once lucky enough to come upon few of the very much smaller number which pass the summer in northern new hampshire this was in the white mountain notch ﬁrst on mount willard and then near the crawford house at which latter place they were feeding on the lawn and along the railway track familiarly the goldﬁnches the shore larks too are doubt common near boston part of every year yet i found half dozen ﬁve or six years ago in the marsh beside back bay street and have seen none since one of these stood upon pile of earth singing to himself in an undertone while the rest were feeding in the grass whether the singer was playing sentinel and sounded an alarm i was not sure but all at once the ﬂock started off if on single pair of wings birds which elude the observer in this manner year after year only render themselves all the more interesting they are like other species with which we deem ourselves well acquainted but which suddenly appear in some quite time or place the and the unexpected have both an especial charm i have elsewhere avowed my favoritism the sparrow but i was never more delighted to see him than on one christmas afternoon i was walking in back road not far from the city when i descried sparrow ahead of feeding in the path and coming nearer recognized my friend the he held his ground till the last moment time was precious to him that short day and then ﬂew into bush to let pass which i had sooner done than he was back again and on my return the same thing was repeated far and near the ground was white but just at this place the had scraped bare few square feet of earth and by great good fortune this solitary and hungry straggler had hit upon it i wondered what he would when the resources of this garden patch were exhausted but consoled myself with thinking that by this time he must be well used to living by his wits and would probably ﬁnd way to so even in his present untoward circumstances the not to be confounded with the snow buntings should have at least mention in such paper this they are among the most familiar and constant of our winter guests although very much less numerous at that time than in spring and autumn when the ﬁelds and lanes are fairly alive with them kind word must be said the shrike also who during the three coldest months is to be seen on the common oftener than any other of our native birds

the best way to represent to life the manifold use of friendship is to cast and see how many things there are which man can not himself how aptly their case illustrates the not unusual coexistence of

summer quarters the roads were comparatively dry the snow was entirely gone except patch or two in the shadow of thick pines under the northerly side of hill and all tokens seemed to promise an early spring so much i learned before the hastening twilight cut short my ﬁrst brief turn in the morning would be time enough to discover what birds had already reported themselves at my station unknown to

nothing of putting his head and neck clean under water like duck and sometimes waded the brook when the current was so strong that he was compelled every now and then to stop and brace himself against it lest he should be carried of f his feet it is clear that birds sharing the frailty of some who are better than many sparrows are often wanting in patience spring draws near they can not wait its coming what it has been the fashion to call their unerring instinct is after all infallible only certain great public functionary is theory and their mistaken haste is too frequently nothing but hurrying to their death but i saw evidence that this particular storm was attended with any fatal consequences the snow completely disappeared within day or two and even while it lasted the song sparrows fox sparrows and linnets could be heard singing with all cheerfulness on the coldest day when the mercury settled to within twelve degrees of zero i observed that the song sparrows they fed in the road had trick of crouching till their feathers all but touched the ground so protecting their legs against the biting wind the ﬁrst indications of mating were noticed on the 5th the parties being two pairs of bluebirds one of the females was rebufﬁng her suitor rather petulantly but when he ﬂew away she lost time in following shall i be accused of slander if i suggest that possibly her meant nothing worse than ask again i trust not she was only bluebird remember three days later i came upon two couples engaged in in this business the female takes the lead with silent abstracted air if the matter were one of absorbing interest while her mate follows her about somewhat impatiently and with good deal of talk which is plainly intended to hasten the decision come come he says the season is short and we ca waste the whole of it in getting ready i never could discover that his eloquence produced much effect however her ladyship will have her own way indeed she ought to have good soul considering that she is to have the discomfort and the hazard in one case i was puzzled by the fact that there seemed to be two females to one of the opposite sex it really looked if the fellow proposed to set up housekeeping with whichever should ﬁrst ﬁnd house to her mind but this is slander and i hasten to take it back doubt i misinterpreted his behavior it is sorrow i confess i am yet but imperfectly at home in the sialian dialect the ﬁrst fortnight my is full of the sparrows it was worth while to have come into the country ahead of time city people reckon to get my ﬁll of this northern songster music morning and night wherever i walked and even if i remained i was certain to hear the loud and beautiful strain to which i listened with the more attention because the birds i knew would soon be off their native ﬁelds beyond the boundaries of the united states it is astonishing how gloriously birds may sing and yet pass unregarded we read of nightingales and skylarks with thrill of enthusiasm and meanwhile our native songsters even the best of them are piping unheeded at our very doors there may have been half dozen of the town people who noticed the presence of these fox sparrows but i think it doubtful and yet the birds the largest handsomest and most musical of all our many sparrows were i say abundant everywhere and in full voice one afternoon i stood still while fox sparrow and song sparrow sang alternately on either side of both exceptionally good vocalists and each doing his best the songs were of about equal length and far theme was concerned were not little alike but the fox sparrow tone was both louder and more mellow than the other while his notes were longer sustained his voice was carried from one pitch to another pg 217 pg 218 pg 219 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https the whole i had hesitation about giving him the palm but i am bound to say that his rival was worthy competitor in some respects indeed the latter was the more interesting singer of the two his opening measure of three pips was succeeded by trill of quite peculiar brilliancy and perfection and when the other bird had ceased he suddenly took lower perch and began to rehearse an altogether different tune in voice not more than half loud what he had been using after which if to cap the climax he several times followed the tune with detached phrase or two in still fainter voice this last was pretty certainly an improvised cadenza such thing i not remember ever to have heard before from melospiza melodia the song of the fox sparrow has at times an almost quality and the bird himself he ﬂies up in front of you might easily be mistaken some member of that noble family once indeed when i saw him eating berries in boston garden i was half ready to believe that i had before my eyes living example of the development of one species out of another ﬁnch already well on his way to become thrush most often however his voice puts in mind of the cardinal grosbeak his voice and perhaps still more his cadence and especially his practice of the portamento the 11th of the month was sunny and the next morning i came back from my accustomed rounds under sense of bereavement the fox sparrows were gone where yesterday there had been hundreds of them now i could ﬁnd only two silent stragglers they had been well scattered over the township ﬂock and there ﬂock but in some should be glad to have anybody tell word had passed from company to company that after sundown friday night all hands would set out once more on their northward journey there was one man at least who missed them and in the comparative silence which followed their departure appreciated anew how much they had contributed to ﬁll the wet and chilly april mornings with melody and good cheer the tarried longer but from this date became less and less abundant the ﬁrst third of the month they had been numerous i calculated all other species put together on one occasion i saw large company of them chasing an albino the latter dashing wildly round with the whole ﬂock in furious pursuit they drove him off across an impassable morass before i could get close enough really to see him but i presumed him to be of their own kind far i could make out he was entirely white the moment it lasted it was an exciting scene and i was especially gratiﬁed to notice with what extreme heartiness and unanimity the birds discountenanced their wayward brother heterodoxy i agreed with them that one who can not be content to dress like other people ought not to be allowed to live with them the world is large him go to rhode island on the evening of the 6th just at dusk i had started up the road lazy saunter when i was brought to sudden halt by what on the instant i took the cry of but could be here thus early in the season and listening further i perceived that the bird if bird it was was on the ground or at any rate not far from it then it ﬂashed upon that this was the note of the woodcock which i had that very day startled upon this same hillside now then another sight of his famous aerial courtship act so scrambling down the embankment and clambering over the i pushed up the hill through bushes and briers till having come near the bird i dared i crouched and awaited further developments i had not long to wait after few yaks at intervals of perhaps ﬁfteen or twenty seconds the fellow took to wing and went soaring in circle above calling hurriedly click click click with break now and then if all this he repeated several times but unfortunately it was too dark to see him except he crossed narrow illuminated strip of sky just above the horizon line i judged that he mounted to very considerable height and dropped invariably into the exact spot from which he had started week or two i listened every night repetition of the yak but i heard nothing more of it month then it came to my ears again this time from ﬁeld between the road and swamp watching my opportunity while the bird was in the air i hastened across the ﬁeld and stationed myself against small cedar he was still clicking pg 220 pg 221 pg 222 pg 223 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https overhead but soon alighted silently within twenty yards of where i was standing and commenced to bleat prefacing each yak with fainter syllable which i had never before been near enough to detect presently he started once more on his skyward journey up he went in large spiral higher still and higher till the cedar cut off my view an instant after which i could not again get my eye upon him wheth er he saw or not i can not tell but he dropped to the ground some rods away and did not make another ascension although he continued to call irregularly and appeared to be walking about the ﬁeld perhaps by this time the fair one whose beneﬁt all this parade was intended had come out of the swamp to meet and reward her admirer hoping repetition of the same programme on the following night i invite d friend from the city to witness it with one who less fortunate than the forest seer had never heard the woodcock evening hymn notwithstanding his knowledge of birds is more than mine all students of american ornithology would unhesitatingly avouch were i to mention his name we waited till dark but though philohela was there and sounded his yak two or three times enough to excite our hopes some reason he kept to terra ﬁrma perhaps he was aware of our presence and disdained to exhibit himself in the rôle of wooer under our profane and curious gaze or possibly my more scientiﬁc and less sentimental companion suggested the light breeze may have been counted unfavorable such exploits after all our matter world is surprisingly full of romance who would have expected to ﬁnd this bird singing at heaven gate he scorner of the ground verily love worketh wonders and perhaps it is really true that the outward semblance is sometimes deceptive to be candid however i must end with confessing that after listening to the woodcock hymn good many times ﬁrst and last i can not help thinking that it takes an imaginative ear to discover anything properly to be called song in its monotonous click click even at its fastest and loudest 23 while i was enjoying the farewell matinée of the sparrows on the 11th suddenly there ran into the chorus the ﬁne silver thread of the winter wren tune here was pleasure unexpected it is down in all the books i believe that this bird does not sing while on his travels and certainly i had myself never known him to anything of the sort before but there is always something new under the sun i was all ear of course standing motionless while the delicious music came again and again out of tangle of underbrush behind dilapidated spot all the world congenial to this tiny recluse whose whole life we may say is one long game of altogether the song was repeated twenty times at least and to my thinking i had never heard it given with greater brilliancy and fervor the darling little minstrel he will never know how grateful i felt i even forgave him when he sang thrice from living bush albeit in so doing he spoiled sentence which i had already committed to the permanency of print birds of all kinds will play such tricks upon us but whether the fault be chargeable to ﬁckleness or mischievous spirit on their part rather than to undue haste on the part of us their reporters is matter about which i am perhaps not sufﬁciently disinterested to judge in this instance however it was reasonably certain that the singer did not show himself intentionally unless the whole tenor of his life belies him the winter wren motto is little birds should be heard and not seen two days afterward i was favored again in like manner but not by the same bird i think unless my hearing was at fault the singer was further off than before this one tune was pg 224 pg

troglodytes hiemalis ﬁrst their music itself and then the support which it gave to pet theory of mine that all our singing birds will yet be found to sing more or less regularly in the course of the vernal migration within another hours this same theory received additional conﬁrmati on i was standing under an watching pair of titmice who were hollowing out stub nest when my ear caught novel song not far away of course i made towards it but the bird ﬂew off across the road and into the woods my hour was up and i reluctantly started homeward but had gone only few rods before the song was repeated this was more than human nature could bear and turning back upon the run i got into the woods just in time to see two birds chasing each other round tree both uttering the very notes which had so roused my curiosity then away they went but i was again bewailing my evil luck one of them returned and ﬂew into the oak directly over my head and he did so fell to calling anew sue suky suky single glance upward revealed that this was another of the silent migrants brown creeper only once before had i heard from him anything beside his customary lisping zee zee and even on that occasion in june and in new hampshire the song bore resemblance to his present effort i have written it down it sounded at the moment sue suky suky ﬁve notes the ﬁrst longer than the others and all of them brusque loud and musical though with something of warbler quality 24 it surprised to ﬁnd how the migratory movement lagged the ﬁrst half of the month pair of swallow s ﬂew over my head while i was attending to the winter wren on the 11th and on the 14th appeared the ﬁrst warblers welcome their own sakes and doubly so the forerunners of numerous and splendid company but aside from these two i saw evidence that single new species arrived at my station the entire fortnight robins sang sparingly from the beginni ng and became perceptibly more music al on the 8th with signs of mating and jealousy but the real robin carnival did not open till the morning of the 14th then the change was wonderful some of the birds were ﬂying this way and that high in air two or three together others chased each other about nearer the ground some were screaming some hissing and more singing so sudden was the outbreak and so great the commotion that i was persuaded there must have been an arrival of females in the night i have heard it objected against these thrushes whose extreme commonness renders them less highly esteemed than they would otherwise be that they ﬁnd their voices too early in the morning but i am not myself prepared to second the criticism they are not often at their matins i think until the eastern sky begins to ﬂush and it is not quite certain to my mind that they are wrong in assuming that daylight makes daytime i have questioned before now whether our own custom of sitting up ﬁve or six hours after sunset and then lying abed two or three hours after sunrise may not have come down to us from times when there were still people in the world who loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil and whether after all in this in some other respects we might not wisely take pattern of the fowls of the air individually the phœbes were almost noisy the robins but of course their numbers were far less they are models of perseverance were their voice equal to the nightingale they could hardly be more assiduous and enthusiastic in its use general thing they are content to repeat the simple phœbe phœbe there are moods in the experience of all of us i hope when the repetition of name is by itself music sufﬁcient but it is not uncommon this to be heightened to phœbe phœbe and now and then you will hear some fellow calling excitedly phœbe comical sort of stuttering in which the difﬁculty is not in getting hold of the ﬁrst syllable but in letting go the last one on the 15th i witnessed certain other performance of theirs pg 227 pg 228 pg 229 pg 230 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https that i had seen two or three times the season previous and which i had been on the lookout from the ﬁrst day of the month i heard series of chips which might have been the cries of chicken but which it appeared did proceed from phœbe who i looked up was just in the act of quitting his perch on the of barn he rose perhaps thirty feet not spirally but in zigzag course horse climbing hill with heavy load the time calling chip chip chip then he went round and round in small circle with kind of hovering action of the wings vociferating hurriedly phœbe phœbe phœbe after which he shot down into the top of tree and with lively ﬂirt of his tail took up again the same eloquent theme during the next few weeks i several times found birds of this species similarly engaged and it is worthy of remark that of the four ﬂycatchers which regularly pass the summer with us three may be said to be in the habit of singing in the air while the fourth the wood pewee does the same thing only with less frequency it is curious also on the other hand that not one of our eight common new england thrushes far i have ever seen or heard shows the least tendency toward any such state of lyrical exaltation yet the thrushes are song birds par excellence while the phœbe the least ﬂycatcher and the kingbird are not supposed to be able to sing at all the latter have the soul of music in them at any rate and why should it not be true of birds it is of human poets and poets that sensibility and faculty are not always found together perhaps those who have nothing but the sensibility have after all the better half of the blessing the woodpeckers shout ed comparatively little before the middle of the month and i heard nothing of their tender until the 22d after that they were noisy enough with all their power of lungs however they not only are not singers they not aspire to be they belong to the tribe of jubal hearing somebody drum ming on tin i peeped over the wall and saw one of these pigeon woodpeckers hammering an old tin pan lying in the middle of the pasture rather small sport i thought so large bird but that was matter of opinion merely and evidently the performer himself had such scruples he may even have considered that his ability to play on this instrument of the tinsmith went far to put him on an equality with some who boast themselves the only animals true the pan was battered and rusty but it was resona nt all that and day after day he pleased hims elf with beating reveille upon it one morning i found him sitting in tree screaming lustily in response to another bird in an adjacent ﬁeld after while waxing ardent he dropped to the ground and stationing himself before his drum proceeded to answer each cry of his rival with vigorous rubadub varying the programme with an occasion al halloo how long this would have lasted there is telling but he caught sight of skulking behind and ﬂew back to his lofty perch where he was still shouting when i came away it was observable that even in his greatest excitement he paused once in while to dress his feathers at ﬁrst i was inclined to take this betraying want of earnestness but further reﬂection led to different conclusion i imagine that the human lover matter how consuming his passion is seldom carried so far beyond himself not to be able to spare now and then thought to the parting of his hair and the tie of his cravat seeing the great delight which this woodpecker took in his precious tin pan it seemed to not at all improbable that he had selected his summer residence with view to being near it just i had chosen mine its convenience of access to the woods on the one hand and to the city on the other i shall watch with interest to see whether he returns to the same pasture another year few ﬁeld sparrows and chippers showed themselves punctually on the 15th but they were only scouts and the great body of their followers were more than week behind them i saw buntings until the 22d although it is likely enough they had been here some days before that by lucky chance my very ﬁrst bird was peculiarly accomplished musician he altered his tune at nearly every repetition of it sang it sometimes loudly and then softly and once in while added phrases it lost nothing by being heard on bright frosty morning when the edges of the pools were ﬁlmed with ice pg 231 pg 232 pg 233 pg 234 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https three species of warblers appeared during the month the warblers already spoken of who were trilling on the 14th the who came on the 23d and the yellow who followed the next morning the greens were mysteriously tardy and the creepers waited single brown thrush was leading the chorus on the 29th great singer my book says not so altogether faultless some but with large voice and style adapted to great part and then is added i thought this morning of titiens i listened to him bit of impromptu musical criticism which under cover of the saving quotation marks may stand what it is worth not long after leaving him i ran upon two hermit thrushes one had been seen on the 25th ﬂitting about the woods like ghosts i whistled softly to the ﬁrst and he condescended to answer with low chuck after which i could get nothing more out of him this demure taciturnity is very curious and characteristic and to very engaging the fellow will neither skulk nor run but hops upon some low branch and looks at you not little if you were the specimen and he the student and in such case far i can see the bird equally with the man has right to his own point of view the hermits were not yet in tune and without forgetting the sparrows and the linnets the song sparrows and the the winter wrens and the brown thrush i am almost ready to declare that the best music of the month came from the smallest of all the month birds the kinglets their spring season is always short with us and unhappily it was this year shorter even than usual my dates being april 23d and may 5th but we must be thankful little when the little is of such quality once i descried two of them in the topmost branches of clump of tall maples long time they fed in silence then they began to chase each other about through the trees in graceful evolutions i can imagine nothing more graceful and soon one and then the other broke out into song riches in little room my says again and truly the song is marvelous prolonged and varied warble introduced and often broken into with delightful effect by wrennish chatter ﬂuency smoothness and ease and especially purity and sweetness of tone i have never heard any that seemed to more nearly perfect if the dainty creature would bear conﬁnement on which point i know nothing would make an ideal parlor songster his voice while round and full contrast with the goldﬁnch example yet even at its loudest of wonderful softness and delicacy nevertheless i trust that nobody will ever cage him better far go and drink in the exquisite sounds they drop from the thick of some tall pine while you catch now and then glimpse of the tiny author ﬂitting busily from branch to branch warbling at his work or you may oftener look and listen to your heart content while he explores some low cedar or cluster of roadside birches too innocent and happy to heed your presence so you will carry home not the song only but the river and sky but if the kinglets were individually the best singers i must still confess that the goldﬁnches gave the best concert it was on sunny afternoon 27th in small grove of tall how many birds there were i could form little estimate but when ﬁfteen ﬂew away minute or two the chorus was not perceptibly diminished all were singing twittering and calling together some of them directly over my head the rest scattered throughout the wood one voice predominated in the least all sang softly and with an indescribable tenderness and beauty any who not know how sweet the goldﬁnch note is may get some conception of the effect of such concert if they will imagine ﬁfty canaries thus engaged i declared then that i had never heard anything so enchanting and i am not certain even now that i was enthusiastic warbler i remember broke in upon the choir two or three times with his loud precise trill foolish bird his is pretty song by itself but set in contrast with music so full of imagination and poetry it sounded painfully abrupt and prosaic pg 235 pg 236 pg 237 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https discovered the ﬁrst signs of on the 13th while investigating the question of bird it happened that i had just been watching chickad ee he picked chip after chip from dead branch and held them fast with one claw while he broke them in pieces with his beak and walking away it occurred to to ask whether or not he could probably use both feet equally well such purpose accordingly seeing another go into an i drew near to take his testimony on that point but when i came to look him he was nowhere in sight and pretty soon it appeared that he was at work in the end of an upright stub which he had evidently but just begun to hollow out the tip of his tail still protruded over the edge curiosity can always adapt itself to circumstances and in this case it was hardship to postpone the settlement of my newly raised inquiry while i observed the pretty labors of my little architect these proved to be by means inconsiderable lasting nearly or quite three weeks the birds were still bringing away chips on the 30th when their cavity was about eleven inches deep but it is to be said that far i could ﬁnd out they neve r worked in the afternoon or on rainy days their demeanor toward each other all this time was beautiful to see effusiv display of affection but every appearance of perfect mutual understanding and contentment and their treatment of was less appropriate and delightful happy combination of freedom and digniﬁed reserve i took it an extremely neat compliment to myself well incontestable evidence of unusual powers of discrimination on their part on my second visit the female sounded call i approached the tree and i looked to see her mate take some notice of it but he kept straight on with what he was doing not long after she spoke again however and now it was amusing to see the fellow all at once stand still on the top of the stub looking up and around much to say what is it my dear i see nothing apparently it was nothing and he went head ﬁrst into the hole again pretty soon while he was inside i stepped up against the trunk his mate continued silent and after what seeme d long time he came out ﬂew to an adjacent twig dropped his load and returned this he did over and over the end of the stub was perhaps ten feet above my head and once he let fall beakful of chips plump in my face they were light and i did not resent the liberty two mornings later i found him at his task again toiling in good earnest in and out he went taking care to bring away the shavings at every trip before and generally sounding note or two keeping the tally perhaps before he dropped them the ﬁfteen minutes or so that i remained his mate was perched in another branch of the same tree not once shifting her position and doing nothing whatever except to preen her feathers little she paid attention to her husband nor did he to her it was revelation to that chickadee could possibly sit still so long eight days after this they were both at work spelling each other and then going off in company brief turn at feeding so far they had never manifested the least annoyance at my espionage but the next morning i stood against the tree one of them seemed slightly disturbed and ﬂew from twig to twig about my head looking at from all directions with his shining black eyes the reconnoissance was satisfactory however everything went on before and several times the chips rattled down upon my stiff derby hat the hole was getting deep it was plain i could hear the little carpenter hammering at the bottom and then scrambling up the walls on his way out one of the pair brought black tidbit from pine near by and offered it to the other he emer ged into daylight he took it from her bill said chit chickadese thank you hastened back into the mine finally on the 27th after watching their operations while from the ground i swung myself into the tree and took seat with them to my delight the work proceeded without interruption neither bird made any outcry although one of them hopped round just out of reach with evident curio sity he must have thought queer specimen when i drew my overcoat up after and put it on they ﬂew away but within minute or two they were both back again work ing merrily ever and taking pains not to pg 238 pg 239 pg 240 pg 241 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https with their rubbish once the female i took it to be she from her smaller size not from this piece of shiftlessness dropped her load without quitting the stub thing i had not seen either of them before twice one brought the other something to eat at last the male took another turn at investigating my character and it began to look if he would end with alighting on my hat this time too i am proud to say the verdict was favorable their conﬁdence was not misplaced and unless all signs failed they reared full brood of tits may their tribe increase of birds so innocent and unobtrusive so graceful so hearted and so musical the world can never have too many f t n t s in the titmouse cosmological system trees occupy highly important place we may be sure while the purpose of their tall upright method of growth doubt receives very simple and logical and correspondingly lucid explanation while this book is passing through the press april 30th 1885 i am privileged with another sight and sound of the woodcock vespertine performance and under peculiarly favorable conditions in the account given above sufﬁcient distinction is not made between the clicking noise heard while the bird is soaring and the sounds which signalize his descent the former is probably produced by the wings although i have heretofore thought otherwise while the latter are certainly vocal and doubt intended song but they are little if at all louder than the click click of the wings and far i have ever been able to make out are nothing more than series of quick breathless whistles with attempt at either melody or rhythm in the present instance i could see only the start and the ﬁnish when the bird several times passed directly by and over i stood in cluster of low birches within two or three rods of his point of departure his angle of ﬂight was small quite if he had been going and coming from one ﬁeld to another in the ordinary course once i timed him and found that he was on the wing few seconds more than minute still further to corroborate my pet theory i may say here in what i have said elsewhere with more detail that before the end of the following month the hermit thrushes the thrushes and the thrushes all sang in my melrose woods let explain also that when i call the brown creeper silent migrant i am not unaware that others beside myself and more than myself have heard him sing

my associates in grumbling about the weather talk would speedily come to an end in such circumstances if people were forbidden to criticise the order of nature and it is not to boast any peculiar sanctity in this respect but when all was over it had to be acknowledged that i one had been kept very little in fact if the whole truth were told it would probably appear that my fellow boarders seeing my persistency in disregarding the inclemency of the elements soon came to look upon decidedly odd though perhaps not absolutely demented at any rate i was rather glad than otherwise to think

observed is not the case and it is fact perfectly well attested though perhaps not yet scientiﬁcally accounted many things are known to be true which the present can not be mathematically demonstrated that near the top of mountain thirty rods are equivalent to good deal more than four hundred and feet let the speciﬁcation stand therefore in all its surveyor exact ness after making the climb four

of the most abundant was the beautiful cystopteris bulbifera its long narrow pale green delicately cut fronds bending toward the ground at the tip if about to take root new start in the manner some of these could not have been less than four feet in length including the stipe and i picked one which measured about two feet and half and bore bulblets underneath half mile from the start or thereabouts

one dense mass of ferns in the centre was patch of the sensitive fern onoclea sensibilis while around this and ﬁlling nearly the entire circle was magniﬁcent thicket of the ostrich fern onoclea struthiopteris with sensibilis growing hidden and scattered underneath about the edge were various other species notably aspidium goldianum which i here found the ﬁrst time and aspidium aculeatum var

never growing in anything like bed or tuft was nevertheless common throughout the woods you could gather handful almost anywhere but i found only one plant of botrychium lanceolatum and only two of botrychium matricariæfolium and these long distance apart even though on account of their rarity and because i had never before seen the latter i spent considerable time ﬁrst and last in hunting them

seemed to that some of the ferns the example ought to have suited them better but they passed these all by far i could detect about the edges of the woods and in favorable positions well up the the ﬂowering raspberry was ﬂourishing making display of itself but offering to any who should choose to turn aside and look at them few blossoms such beauty and fragrance are worthy to be they really are cousin to the rose on one of my rambles i came upon some plants of strangely slim and prim aspect nothing but straight erect stalk bearing spike of pods at the top and clasped at the middle by two small stemless leaves by some occult means perhaps their growing with tiarella had something to with the matter i felt at once that these must be the mitrewort mitella diphylla my prophetic soul was not always thus explicit and infallible however other novelties i saw about which i could make such happy impromptu guess and here the manual afforded little assistance it has not yet been found practicable to analyze and so to identify plants simply by the stem and foliage i remember to have been told to be sure of young lady who professed that at her college the instruction in botany was so thorough that it was possible the student to name any plant in the world from seeing only single leaf but her college was not harvard and professor gray has probably never so much heard of such an admirable method on the whole it is good to have the curiosity piqued with here and there vegetable stranger name and even its family relationship mystery the leaf is nothing extraordinary perhaps yet

now bearing green berries while below these was variegated carpet oxalis and the ﬂower of linnæus ferns and the glossy lycopodium lucidulum was especially plentiful to say nothing of the true mosses and the lichens of all these things i should have seen more doubt had not my head been so much of the time in the yonder were the birds and how could i be expected to notice what lay at my feet while i was watching intently glimpse of the warbler that ﬂitted from twig to twig amid the foliage of some beech or maple the very lowest branch of which likely enough was ﬁfty or sixty feet above the ground it was in this way so i choose to believe at any rate that i walked four or ﬁve times directly over the leaved hepatica before i ﬁnally discover ed it notwithstanding it was one of the plants which i had all the while been on the lookout i said that the birds were in the but of course there were exceptions here and there was thrush feeding on the ground or an might be seen picking his devious way through the underwoods in paths of his own and with gait of studied and sanctimonious originality in the list of the lowly must be put the winter wrens also one need never look skyward them minute or two during my ﬁrst ascent of owl head i had lively hopes of ﬁnding one of their nests two or three of the birds were scolding earnestly right about my feet it were and their cries redoubled or so i imagined when i approached certain large stump this i looked over carefully on all sides putting my ﬁngers into every possible hole and crevice till it pg 253 pg 254 pg 255 pg 256 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https evident that nothing was to be gained by further search what long chapter we could write any of us who are ornithologists about the nests we did not ﬁnd it dawned upon little later that i had been fooled that it was not the nest which had been in question at all that wherever it was had been forsaken some days before and the birds were parents and young the former distracting my attention by their outcries while at the same moment they were ordering the youngsters to make off quickly possible lest yonder hungry ﬁend should catch and devour them if wrens ever laugh this pair must have done so that evening they recalled to each other my eager fumbling of that innocent old stump this opinion to the meaning of their conduct was conﬁrmed in the course of few days when i came upon another similar group these were at ﬁrst quite unaware of my presence and very pretty family picture they made in their snuggery of overthrown trees the father breaking out into song once in while or helping his mate to feed the young who were already able to pick up good part of their own living before long however one of the pair caught sight of the intruder and then all at once the scene changed the old birds chattered and scolded bobbing up and down in their own ridiculous manner although considered by itself this gesture is perhaps more laughable than some which other orators are applauded making and soon the place was silent and to all appearance deserted notwithstanding owl head is in canada the birds i soon found were not such characterize the canadian fauna thrushes warblers crossbills pine linnets and canada jays all of which i had myself seen in the white mountains were none of them here but instead to my surprise were wood thrushes scarlet tanagers and wood pewees two latter species in comparative abundance my ﬁrst wood thrush was seen moment only and although he had given plain sight of his back i concluded that my eyes must once more have played false but within day or two when down the mountain path i heard the strain ringing through the woods it was unquestionably that and nothing else i sat down upon convenient log and listened ten minutes or more while the singer ran through all those inimitable variations which infallibly distinguish the wood thrush song from every other and afterward to make assurance doubly sure i again saw the bird in the best possible position and at short range on looking into the subject indeed i learned that his being here was nothing wonderful since while it is true far the is concerned that he seldom ventures north of massachusetts it is none the less down in the books that he does pass the summer in lower canada reaching it probably by way of the valley of the lawrence few robins were about the hotel and i saw single veery in the woods but the only members of the thrush family that were present in large numbers were the hermits these sang everywhere and at all hours on the summit even at i was invariably serenaded by them in fact they seemed more abundant there than anywhere else but they were often to be heard by the and in our apple orchard and once at least one of them sang at some length from within few feet of the piazza between it and the bowling alley far i have ever been able to discover the hermit all his name and consequent reputation is less timorous and more approachable than any other new england representative of his on this trip i settled once more question which i had already settled several times question namely whether the wood thrush or the hermit is the better singer this time my decision was in favor of the form er how the case would have turned had the conditions been reversed had there been hundred of the wood thrushes one of the hermits of course i can not tell so true is certain old latin proverb that in matters of this sort it is impossible man to agree even with himself any long time together the conspicuous birds noticed by everybody were family of hawks the visitor might have appreciation of music he might go up the mountain and down again without minding the thrushes or the wrens or there is nothing about the human ear more wonderful than its ability not to hear but these hawks passed good part of every day in screaming and were bound to be attended to by all but the native of the pg 257 pg 258 pg 259 pg 260 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https pointed out ledge on which according to his account they had made their nest more than thirty years we call them mountain hawks he said in answer to an inquiry the keepers of the hotel naturally enough called them eagles while young canadian who one day overtook i neared the summit and spent an hour there in my company pronounced them i asked him carelessly how he could be sure of that and he replied after little hesitation why they are all the time over the lake and besides they sometimes dive into the water and come up with ﬁsh the last item would have been good evidence doubt my difﬁculty was that i had never seen them near the lake and what was more concl usive their heads were if not really black few minutes after this conversation i happened to have my glass upon one of them he approached the mountain at some distance below us when my comrade asked looking at that bird yes i answered on which he continued in matter fact tone that crow plainly thinking that i appeared to be slightly inquisitive about such matters it would be kindness to tell thing or two i made bold to intimate that the bird had barred tail and must i thought be one of the hawks he did not dispute the point and in truth he was modest and young gentleman i liked him in that he knew both how to converse and how to be silent without which latter qualiﬁcation indeed not even an angel would be desirable companion he gave information about the surrounding country such i was very glad to get and in the case of the hawks my advantage over him if any was mainly in this my lack of knowledge partook somewhat more fully than his of the nature of lord bacon learned ignorance that knows itself whatever the birds may have been mountain hawks or their aerial evolutions seen from the summit were beautiful beyond descrip tion one day in particular three of them were performing together time they chased each other this way and that at lightning speed screaming wildly though whether in sport or anger i could not determine then they ﬂoated majestically high above us while now and then one would set his wings and shoot down down till the precipitous side of the mountain hid him from view only to reappear minute afterward soaring again with apparent ef fort to his former height one of these noisy fellows served an excellent turn it was the last day of my visit and i had just taken my farewell look at the enchanting prospect from the summit when i heard the lisp of brown creeper this was the ﬁrst of his kind that i had seen here and i stopped immediately to watch him in hopes he would sing creeper he tried one tree after another in quick succession till at last while he was exploring dead spruce which had toppled to the ground hawk screamed loudly overhead instantly the little creature ﬂattened himself against the trunk spreading his wings to their very utmost and ducking his head until though i had been all the while eying his motions through glass at the distance of only few rods it was almost impossible to believe that yonder tiny brown ﬂeck upon the bark was really bird and not lichen he remained in this posture perhaps minute only putting up his head two or three times to peer cautiously round unless i misjudged him he did not discriminate between the screech of the hawk and the ank ank of nuthatch which followed it and this with an indeﬁnable something in his manner made suspect him of being young bird young or old however he had learned one lesson well at all events one which i hoped would keep him out of the talons of his enemies long days to come it was pleasant to see how cheerfully he resumed work soon the alarm was over this danger was escaped at any rate and why should he make himself miserable with worrying about the next he had the true philosophy we who pity the birds their numberless perils are ourselves in better case consumption fevers accidents enemies of every name are continually lying in wait our destruction we walk surrounded with them seeing them not to be sure but knowing all the same that they are there yet feeling too like the birds that in some way or other we shall elude them while longer and holding at second hand the truth which these humble creatures practice upon instinctively sufﬁcient unto the day is the evil thereof pg 261 pg 262 pg 263 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https far from this spot on previous occasion i had very unexpectedly come face to face with another of the creeper sty persecutors it happened that warbler was singing in lofty birch and being in doubt about the song which was little like the nashville but longer in each of its two parts and ending with less confused ﬂourish i was of course very desirous to see the singer but to catch sight of small bird amid thick foliage ﬁfty feet or more above you is not an easy matter i believe i have already once remarked so when i grew weary of the attempt i bethought myself to try the efﬁcacy of an old device well known to all collectors and proceeded to imitate well i could the cries of some bird in distress my warbler was imperturbable he had nest or young to be anxious about and kept on singing but pretty soon i was apprised of something in the air coming toward and looking up beheld large owl who appeared to be dropping straight upon my head he saw in time to avoid such catastrophe however and describing graceful curve alighted on low branch near by and stared at only an owl can then away he went while at the same instant jay dashed into the thicket and out again shouting derisively i saw you i saw you evidently the trick was good one and moderately well played in further conﬁrmation of which the owl hooted twice in response to some peculiarly happy efforts on my part and then actually came back again another look this proved sufﬁcient and he quickly disappeared retiring to his leafy covert or hollow tree to meditate doubt on the strange creature whose unseasonable noises had disturbed his afternoon slumbers likely enough he could not readily fall asleep again wondering how i could possibly ﬁnd my way through the woods in the darkness of daylight so difﬁcult is it we may suppose even an owl to put himself in another place and see with another eyes this little episode over i turned again to the and fortunately the warbler throat was of too ﬁery color to remain long concealed though it was at once pleasure and an annoyance to ﬁnd myself still unacquainted with at least one song out of the blackburnian repertory in times past i had carefully attended to his music and within only few days in the white mountain notch i had taken note of two of its variations but here was still another which neither began with zillup zillup nor ended with zip zip which i had come to look upon the blackburnian yet it must have been my fault not his that i failed to recognize him every bird voice has something characteristic about it just every human voice has tones and inﬂections which those who are sufﬁciently familiar with its owner will infallibly detect the ear feels them although words can not describe them articulate speech is but modern invention it were in comparison with the ﬁve senses and since practice makes perfect it is natural enough that every one of the ﬁve should easily and matter of course perceive shades of difference so slight that language in its present rudimentary state can not begin to take account of them the other warblers at owl head far they came under my notice were the creeper the blue warbler the nashville the green the blue the the the already spoken of the water thrush the maryland roat the canadian ﬂycatcher and the redstart the water thrush i saw only one individual was by the and within rod or two of the bowling alley what strange composite creature he is thrush warbler and sandpiper all in one with such oted appearance too if he must always be ready to wade and such saint vitus dance his must be curious history in particular i should like to know the origin of his teetering habit which seems to put him among the beach birds can it be that such frequenters of shallow water are rendered less conspicuous by this motion and have actually adopted it means of defense just they and many more have taken on color harmonizing with that of their ordinary surroundings 27 the blue warblers were common and like most of their tribe were waiting upon offspring just out of the nest i watched one he offered his charge rather large insect the awkward ﬂedgeling let it fall three times and still the parent picked it up pg 264 pg 265 pg 266 pg 267 the project gutenberg ebook of birds

greens were often singing together i had excellent opportunities to compare the songs of the two species the voices while both very peculiar are at the same time so nearly alike that it was impossible on hearing the ﬁrst note of either strain to tell whose it was with the voice the similarity ends however the organ does not make the singer and while the blue seldom attempts more than harsh monotonous kree kree kree the green possesses the true lyrical gift so that few of our birds have more engaging song than his simple trees trees murmuring trees or if you choose to understand it so sleep sleep pr etty one sleep 28 i saw little of the blue warbler but whenever i took the mount ain path i was certain to hear his whimsical song broken off at the end with smart snap he seemed to have chosen the neighborhood of the fernery his peculiar haunt piece of good taste quite in accord with his general character nothing could well be more beautiful than this bird plumage and his nest which is globular with an entrance on one side is described wonder of elegance while in grace of movement not even the titmouse can surpass him strange that such an exquisite should have so fantastic song i have spoken of the rainy weather there were times when the piazza was far doors it was expedient to venture but even then i was not without excellent feathered society vireos one pair had their nest within twenty feet of the hotel chippers song sparrows robins waxwings and phœbes were to be seen almost any moment while the hermit thrushes i have before mentioned paid us occasional visits the most familiar of our friends however to my surprise were the warblers till now i had never found them at home except in the forests of the white mountains but here they were playing the rôle which in massachusetts we are accustomed to see taken by the summer and by others of the family at ﬁrst knowing that this species was said to build in low evergreens i looked suspiciously at some small spruces which lined the walk to the pier but after while i happened to see one of the birds ﬂying into with something in his bill and following him with my eye beheld him alight on the edge of his nest about four feet from the ground the book said the latest book too but this lawless pair had chosen position which could hardly be less than ten times that height higher at all events than the eaves of the house it was out of reach in the small topmost branches but i watched its owners at my leisure the maple was not more than two rods from my window at this time the nestlings were nearly ready to ﬂy and in the course of day or two i saw one of them sitting in tree in the midst of drenching rain on my offering to lay hold of him he dropped into the grass and when i picked him up both paren ts began to ﬂy about excitedly with loud outcries the male especially went nearly frantic entering the bowling alley where i happened to be and alighting on the ﬂoor then taking to the bole of tree he ﬂuttered helplessly upon it spreading his wings and tail seeming to say plainly words could have done look you monster here another young bird that ca ﬂy why you come and catch him the acting was admirable save the spreading of the tail that was false note the youngster in my hand had tail feathers at all i put the fellow upon tree whence he quickly ﬂew to the ground he could ﬂy down but not up and soon both parents were again supplying him with food the poor thing had not eaten morsel possibly ten minutes very long fast bird of his age i hoped he would fall into the hands of worse enemy than myself but the chances seemed against him the ﬁrst few days after quitting the nest must be full of perils such helpless innocents the credit of my own sex i was pleased to notice that it was the father who manifested the deepest concern and the readiest wit not to say the greatest courage but i am obliged in candor to acknowledge that this feature of the case surprised not little pg 268 pg

in some degree with the gracious and beautiful simplicity of the strain itself music to be heard constantly right under one window it could scarcely be improved sweet brief and remarkab ly unobtrusive without sharpness or emphasis trill not altogether unlike the reeping warbler but less matter and i used to listen to it befor i rose in the morning and it was to be heard at intervals all day long occasionally it was given in an meditative way in kind of if the happy creature had thought of what he was doing then it was at its best but one needed to be near the singer in clearing back of the hotel but surrounded by the forest were always goodly company of birds among the rest family of woodpeckers and in second similar place were sparrows maryland and warblers the last two feeding their young immature warblers are puzzling set the birds themselves have difﬁculty i suppose but seeing young and old together and noting how unlike they are i have before now been reminded of launcelot gobbo saying it is wise father that knows his own child while traversing the woods between these two clearings i saw i thought chimney swift ﬂy out of the top of tree which had been broken off at height of twen or thirty feet i stopped and pretty soon the thing was repeated but even then i was not quick enough to be certain whether the bird really came from the stump or only out of the forest behind it accordingly after soun ding the trunk to make sure it was hollow i sat down in clump of raspberry bushes where i should be sufﬁciently concealed and awaited further developments i waited and waited while the mosquitoes seeing how sheltered i was from the breeze gathered about my head in swarms winter wren at my elbow struck up to sing going over and over with his exquisite tune and scarlet tanager also not far off did what he was somewhat less than the to relieve the tedium of my situation finally when my patience was exhausted the afternoon was wearing away and i had some distance to walk swift ﬂew past from behind and with none of that poising over the entrance such is commonly seen when swift goes down chimney went straight into the trunk in half minute or less he

enough to explain why we were created with black feathers so in brief the discussion runs with the usual result doubt that each side convinces itself we may assume however that these and swifts not carry their disagreement so far actually to refuse to hold fellowship with one another conscience is but imperfectly developed in birds yet and they can hardly feel each other sins and errors of

of massachusetts if perfection be held to consist in the absence of ﬂaw the hermit is unquestionably the more nearly perfect song of the two whatever he attempts is done beyond criticism but his range and variety are far less than his rival and my part i can forgive the latter if now and then he reaches after note lying little beyond his best voice and withal is too commonly wanting in that absolute simplicity and ease which lend such an ineffable charm to the perfo rmance of the hermit and the veery shakespeare is not faultless poet but in the existing state of public opinion it will

veery and even the hermi t what magniﬁcent sextette many i counted upon hearing matter of course but when to these were added the arctic and the gladly confessed surprise i had never heard either species before south of the white mountains nor far i then knew had anybody else been more fortunate than myself yet the birds themselves were seemingly unaware of doing anything new or noteworthy this was especially the case with the and after listening to them three days in succession i began to suspect that they were doing nothing new they had sung every spring in the same manner only in the midst of the grand may medley my ears had somehow failed to take account of their contribution their fourth and farewell appearance was on the 23d when they sang both morning and evening at that time they were in bit of swamp among some tall birches and i caught the familiar and characteristic brief ascending was almost ready to believe myself in some primeval new hampshire forest an illusion not little aided by the frequent lisping of warblers who chanced just then to be remarkably abundant it was on the same day and within short distance of the same spot that the alice thrushes or were in song their music was repeated good many times but unhappily it ceased whenever i tried to get near the birds then always it put in mind of the veery effort notwithstanding certain part of the strain was quite out of the veery manner and the whole was pitched in decidedly too high key it seemed also if what i heard could not be the complete song but i had been troubled with the same feeling on previous occasions and friend whose opportunities have been better than mine reports similiar experience so that it is perhaps not uncharitable to conc lude that the song even at its best is more or less broken and amorphous in their northern homes these ks are excessively wild and unapproach able but while traveling they are little if at all worse than their congeners in this respect short ﬂights when disturbed and often doing nothing more than to hop upon some low perch to reconnoitre the intruder at the risk of being thought to reﬂect upon the acuteness of more competent observers i am free to express my hope of hearin g the music of both these noble visitors again another season it is noticeable how common such things tend to become when once they are discovered an enthusiastic botanical collector told that years he searched far and near the fern till one day he stumbled upon it in place over which he had long been in the habit of passing marking the peculiarities of the spot he straightway wrote to kindred spirit whom he knew to have been engaged in the same hunt suggesting that he would probably ﬁnd the coveted plants in particular section of the meadow back of his own house in concord and sure enough the next day mail brought an envelope from his friend inclosing specimens of ophioglossum vulgatum with the laconic but sufﬁcient message eureka there are few naturalists i suspect who could not narrate adventures of like sort one such befell during this same month in connection with the wood wagtail or thrush not many birds are more abundant than he in my neighborhood and i fancied myself pretty well acquainted with his habits and manners above all i had paid attention to his celebrated listening to it almost daily several summers thus far it had invariably been given out in the afternoon and on the wing to my mind indeed this was by far its most interesting feature in itself the song is by means of surpassing beauty and i had even been careful to record the earliest hour at which i had heard but on the 6th of may aforesaid i detected bird practicing this very tune in the morning and from perch i set the fact down without hesitation wonder purely exceptional occurrence the repetition of which was not to be looked anything might happen once only four days afterwards however at six in the morning i had stooped to gather some peculiarly colored anemones i can see the patch of rosy blossoms at this moment altho ugh i am writing by blazing ﬁre while the snow is falling without when my ear caught the same pg 282 pg 283 pg 284 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https again and keeping my position i soon descried the fellow stepping through the grass within ten yards of caroling he walked the hurried warble with the common weechee weechee weechee interjected in the midst was reiterated perhaps dozen times full evening strain but in rather subdued tone he was under excitement and appeared to be entirely by himself in fact when he had made about half the circuit round he ﬂew into low bush and proceeded to dress his feathers listlessly probably what i had overheard was nothing more than rehearsal within week or two he would need to his very best in winning the fair one of his choice and that supreme moment he had already put himself in training the and obliging little beau i must have been the veriest churl not to wish him his pick of all the feminine wagtails in the wood the pink anemones they had done double kindness in requital which i could only carry them to the city where in their modesty they would have blushed to downright crimson had they been conscious of the admiration which their loveliness called forth before the end of the month it was on the morning of the 18th i once more heard the wagtail song from the ground this time the affair was anything but rehears al there were two birds lover and his lass the wooing waxed fast and furious that matter it looked not so much like like an aggravated case of assault and battery but i say the male was warbling and not improbably so strange are the ways of the world if he had been whit less pugnacious in his addresses his who was plainly well able to take care of herself would have thought him deﬁcient in earnestness at any rate the wood wagtail is not the only bird whose courtship has the appearance of scrimmage and i believe there are still tribes of men among whom similar practices prevail although the greater part of our race have learned by this time to take somewhat less literally the old proverb none but the brave deserve the fair love it is true is still recognized one of the passions in theory at least even among the most highly civilized peoples but the tendency is more and more to count it tender passion while i am on the subject of marriage i may well mention the vireo it had come to be the 16th of the month and yet i had neither seen nor heard anythi ng of this obstreperous genius so i made special pilgrimage to certain favorite haunt of woodcock ascertain if he had arrived after ﬁfteen minutes or more of waiting i was beginning to believe him still absent when he burst out suddenly with his loud and unmistakable who are you now the saucy fellow seemed to say who are you now pretty soon pair of the birds appeared near the male protesting his affection at frantic rate and the female repelling his advances with snappish determina tion which might have driven timid suitor desperate he posed before her pufﬁng out his feathers spreading his tail and crying hysterically yip yip yaah last note downright whine or snarl worthy of the poor soul he was beside himself and could not take an answer even when the word was emphasized with an ugly dab of his beloved beak the pair shortly disappeared in the swamp and i was not privileged to witness the upshot of the battle but i consoled myself with believing that phyllis knew how far she could prudently carry her resistance and would have the discretion to yield before her adorer heart was irremediably broken in this instance there was misconceiving the meaning of the action but whoever watches birds in the pairing season is often at his wit end to know what to make of their demonstrations one morning linnet chased another past down the road ﬂying at the very top of his speed and singing he ﬂew not to be sure the full and copious warble such is heard when the bird hovers but still lively tune i looked on in astonishment it seemed incredible that any creature could sing while putting forth such tremendous muscular exertions and yet if to show that this was mere nothing to him the ﬁnch had sooner struck perch than he broke forth again in his loudest and most spirited manner and continued without pause two or three times the length of his longest ordinary efforts what lungs he must have i said to myself and at once fell to wondering what could have stirred him up to such pitch of excitement and whether the pg 285 pg 286 pg 287 pg 288 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https he had been pursuing was male or female he would have said perhaps if he had said anything that that was none of my business what i have been remarking with regard to the proneness of newly discovered things to become all at once common was well illustrated about this time by these same linnets or purple ﬁnches one rainy morning while making my accustome d rounds enveloped in rubber i stopped to notice vireo who i soon perceived was sitting lazily in the top of looking rather disconsolate and ejaculating with not more than half his customary voice and emphasis mary ware ware his indolence struck very surprising vireo still i had question about his identity he sat between and the sun till i changed my position when behold the vireo was linnet strange performance indeed what could have set this ﬂuent vocalist to practicing exercises of such an inferior disconnected piecemeal sort within the next week or two however the same game was played upon several times and in different places doubt the trick is an old one familiar to many observers but to it had all the charm of novelty there are birds so conservative but that they will now and then indulge in some unexpected stroke of originality few are more artless and regular in their musical efforts than the pine warblers yet i have seen one of these sitting at the tip of tree and repeating trill which toward the close invariably declined by an interval of perhaps three tones even the chipping sparrow whose lay is yet more monotonous and formal than the pine warbler is not absolutely conﬁned to his score i once heard him when his trill was divided into two portions the concluding half being much higher than the other my ear was at fault exactly an octave higher this singular refrain was given out six or eight times without the slightest alteration such freaks these however are different from the linnet mary ware inasmuch they are certainly the idiosyncrasies of single birds not part of the artistic proﬁciency of the species whole during this month i was lucky enough to close little question which i had been holding open number of years concerning our very common and familiar green warbler this species is well known has two perfectly tunes of about equal length entirely distinct from each other my uncertainty had been to whether the two are ever used by the same individual i had listened good many times ﬁrst and last in hopes to settle the point but hitherto without success now however bird while under my eye delivered both songs and then went on to give further proof of his versatility by repeating one of them minus the ﬁnal note this abbreviation by the way is not very infrequent with dendrœca virens and he has still another variation which i hear once in while every season consisting of grace note introduced in the middle of the measure in such connection to form what in musical language is denominated turn at my ﬁrst hearing of this i looked upon it the private property of the bird to whom i was listening improvement which he had accidentally hit upon but it is clearly more than that besides hearing it in different seasons i have noticed it in places good distance apart perhaps after the lapse of ten thousand years more or less the whole tribe of greens will have adopted it and then when some ornithol ogist chances to fall in with an hioned specimen who still clings to the plain song we now commonly hear it he will fancy that to be the very latest modern improvement and proceed forthwith to enlighten the scientiﬁc world with description of the novelty hardly any incident of the month interested more than discovery i must call it such although i am almost ashamed to allude to it at all which i made about the capped titmouse several mornings in succession i was greeted on waking by the trisyllabic minor whistle of chickade who piped again and again not far from my window there could be little doubt about its being the bird that i knew to be excavating building site in one of our but i was usually not until about ﬁve by which time the music always came to an end so one day i rose half an hour earlier than common on purpose to have look at my little matutinal serenader my conjecture proved correct there sat the tit within few feet of his door pg 289 pg 290 pg 291 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https back his head in the truest lyrical fashion and calling hear hear with only breathing space between the repetitions of the phrase he was plainly singing and completely absorbed in his work any thrasher or hermit thrush could have been heretofore i had not realized that these whistled notes were so strictly song and such set apart from all the rest of the chickadee repertory of sweet sounds and i was delighted to ﬁnd my tiny pet recognizing thus unmistakably the difference between prose and poetry but we linger unduly with these lesser lights of song after the music of the alice and the swainson thrushes the chief distinction of may 1884 far my melrose woods were concerned was the entirely unexpected advent of colony of grosbeaks ﬁve seasons i had called these my own and during that time had seen perhaps about the same number of specimens of this royal species always in the course of the vernal migration the present year the ﬁrst comer was observed on the 15th and except an occasional monosyllable silent only one more straggler i assumed but on the following morning i saw four others all of them males in full plumage and two of them in song to one of these i attended some time according to my notes he sang beautifully although not with any excitement nor if he were doing his best the tone was purer and smoother than the robin more mellow and sympathetic and the strain was especial ly characterized by dropping to ﬁne contralto note at the end the next day i saw nothing of my new friends till toward night then after tea i strolled into the chestnut grove and walking along the path noticed robin singing freely remarking the fact becau this noisy bird had been rather quiet of late just i passed under him however it ﬂashed upon that the voice and song were not exactly the robin they must be the then and stepping back to look up i beheld him in gorgeous attire perched in the top of an oak he sang and sang while i stood quietly listening pretty soon he repeated the strain once or twice in softer voice and i glanced up instinctively to see if female were with him but instead there were two males sitting within yard of each other they ﬂew off after little and i resumed my saunter party of chimney swifts were shooting hither and thither over the trees single wood thrush was chanting not far away and in another direction tanager was rehearsing his with characteristic assiduity presently i began to be puzzled by note which came now from this side now from that and sounded like the squeak of pair of rusty shears my ﬁrst conjecture about the origin of this hic it would hardly serve my reputation to make public but i was not long in ﬁnding out that it was the grosbeaks own and that instead of three there were at least twice that number of these brilliant strangers in the grove altogether the half hour was one of very enjoyable excitement and when later in the evening i sat down to my i started off abruptly in hortatory vein always take another walk in the morning naturally enough i again turned my steps toward the chestnut grove the were still there and one of them earned my thanks by singing on the wing ﬂying it singing the ordinary song but more continuously than usual that afternoon one of them was in tune at the same time with robin affording the desired opportunity direct comparison it is really wonderful my record says how nearly alike the two songs are but the robin tone is plainly inferior mellow and full in general too his strain is pitched higher and what perhaps is the most striking point of difference it frequently ends with an attempt at note which is little out of reach so that the voice breaks this last defect by the bye the robin shares with his cousin the wood thrush already remarked few days afterwards to conﬁrm my own impress ion about the likeness of the two songs i called the attention of friend with whom i was walking to grosbeak notes and asked him what bird they were he having good ear matters of this kind looked somewhat dazed at such an inquiry but answered promptly why robin of course one day after another passed however and i listened to both species in full voice on every hand i came to feel that i had overestimated the resemblance with increasing familiarity i discerned more and more clearly the respects in which the songs differed and each came to have to my ear an individuality strictly its own they were alike doubtless the pg 292 pg 293 pg 294 pg 295 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https vireo and the are yet they were not alike of one thing i grew better and better assured the grosbeak is out of all comparison the ﬁner musician of the two to judge from my friends however his concert season is very short more the pity i begin to perceive indeed it has been dawning upon some time that our essay is not to fulﬁll the promise of its caption instead of the glorious fullness and variety of the month music may in this latitude is the musical month of months the reader has been put off with few of the more exceptional features of the carnival he will overlook it i trust and the great body of the chorus who have not been honored with so much mention they i am assured are far too amiable to take offense at any such unintentional slight let conclude then with transcribing from my an evening entry or two music is never so sweet at the twilight hour and the extracts may serve at least convenient and ending paper which so to speak has run away with its writer the ﬁrst is under date of the 19th walked after dinner in the old road i have done often of late and sat while at the entrance to pyrola grove wood thrush was singing not far off and in the midst swainson thrush vouchsafed few measures i wished the latter would continue but was thankful the little tanager called excitedly moving from tree to tree meanwhile once to birch in full sight and then into the pine over my head it grew dark the crowd of warblers were still to be seen feeding busily making the most of the lingering daylight water thrush was teetering along while his congeners the were practicing their aerial hymn one of these went past i stood by the roadside rising very gradually into the air and repeating all the way chip chip chip chip till at last he broke into the warble which was full half longer than usual he was evidently doing his prettiest vireos sang after sunset maryland piped once or twice he is habitually an evening musician and the greens were in tune but the rest of the warblers were otherwise engaged finally just distant whippoorwill began to call towhee sang once from the woods and moment later the stillness was broken by the sudden outburst of thrasher then he seemed to say the rest of you are quite done i will see what i can he kept on two or three minutes in his best manner and at the same time pair of were whispering love together in the thicket then an carriage came rattling along the road and when it had passed every bird voice was hushed the hyla tremulous cry was the only musical sound to be heard i started away one of these hopped out of my path and i picked him up at the second or third attempt what did he think i wonder when i turned him on his back to look at the disks at his probably he supposed that his hour was come but i had evil designs upon him was not to be drowned in alcohol at present walking homeward i heard the robin scream now and again but the thrasher was the last song it deserved to be two days later i ﬁnd the following into the woods by the old road i approached them little after sundown chipper was trilling and song sparrows and golden warblers were singing were the throated greens also and the maryland wood thrush called brusquely but offered further salute to the god of day at his departure were taking to wing on the right and left then it grew dark it grew silent the hylas till suddenly ﬁeld sparrow gave out his sweet strain once after that all was quiet another interval till thrasher from the hillside began to sing he ceased and once more there was stillness all at once the tanager broke forth in strangely excited way blurting out his phrase two or three times and subsiding abruptly he had commenced some crisis in his i imagined now the last launched into the air and let fall little shower of melody and whippoorwill took up his chant afar off this should have been the end but robin across the meadow thought otherwise and set at work if determined to make night of it the robin name ought to be i left the wood the whippoorwill followed coming nearer and nearer till ﬁnally he pg 296 pg 297 pg 298 the project gutenberg ebook of birds in the bush by bradford torrey https and sang with all his might while i tried in vain to see him from tree or the wall near the big buttonwood he too is an early
