away and breathe the fresh and balmy air mary howitt take sunny bracing english may days steal from march many still starry nights to these add two rainy mornings and evenings and the product will resemble typical indian january this is the coolest month in the year month when the climate is invigorating and the sunshine temperate but even in january the sun rays have sufﬁcient power to cause the thermometer to register in the shade at noon save on an occasional cloudy day sunset is marked by sudden fall of temperature the village smoke then hangs few feet above the earth like diaphanous cloud the cold increases throughout the hours of darkness in the punjab form daily and in the milder united provinces the temperature often falls sufﬁciently to allow of the formation of thin sheets of ice towards dawn mists collect which are not dispersed until the sun has shone upon them several hours the vultures await the dissipation of these vapours before they ascend to the upper air there to soar on outstretched wings and scan the earth food on new year day the wheat the barley the gram and the other spring crops are well above the ground and ere january has given place to february the emerald shoots of the corn attain height of fully sixteen inches on these the geese levy toll light showers usually fall in january these are very welcome to the agriculturalist because they impart vigour to the young crops in the seasons when the earth is not blessed with the refreshing winter rain men and oxen are kept busy irrigating the ﬁelds the cutting and the pressing of the sugar employ thousands of husband men and their cattle in almost every village little sugar presses are being worked by oxen from sunrise to sunset at the is illumined by the ﬂames of the megas burned by the rustic sugar january is the month in which the avian population attains its maximum geese ducks teal pelicans cormorants and ospreys abound in the rivers and jhils the marshes and swamps are the resort of millions of snipe and other waders the ﬁelds and groves swarm with ﬂycatchers chats starlings warblers ﬁnches birds of prey and the other migrants which in winter visit the plains from the himalayas and the country beyond the bracing climate of the punjab attracts some species which the milder united provinces have charms conspicuous among these are rooks ravens and jackdaws on the other hand frosts drive away from the land of the five rive rs certain of the feathered folk which not leave the united provinces or bengal to wit the purple sunbird the and to lar ge extent the the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https activity of the feathered folk is not at its height in january birds are creatures and they love not the cold comparatively few of them are in song and still fewer nest at this season song and sound are expressions of energy birds have more vitality more life in them than has any other class of or ganism they are therefore the most noisy of beings many of the calls of birds are purposeful being used to express pleasure or anger or to apprise members of ﬂock of one another presence others appear to serve useful end these are simply the outpourings of superﬂuous energy the expressions of the supreme happiness that perfect health engenders since the vigour of birds is greatest at the nesting season it follows that that is the time when they are most vociferous some birds sing only at the breeding season while others emit their cries at all times hence the avian choir in india in all other countries is composed of two sets of who perform throughout the year the musicians of all times and places and those who join the chorus only few weeks or months the calls of the former class go far to create india its characteristic atmosp here to enumerate all such bird calls would be wearisome the purposes of this calendar it is necessary to describe only the common daily sounds that at all times and all seasons form the basis of the avian chorus from early dawn till nightfall the welkin rings with the harsh caw of the crow the deeper note of the black crow or corby the tinkling music of the bulbuls the cheery keky keky kek kek chur chur kok kok kok of the myna the monotonous of the spotted dove turtur suratensis the soft subdued of the little brown dove cambayensis the mechanical of the risorius the loud penetrating shrieks of the green parrot the calls of the saras crane the of the lapwing the wailing trill hee of the kite the hard grating notes and the metallic of the the sharp towee towee towee of the tailor the soft melodious cheeping calls of the ﬂocks of little the chit chit chitter of the sparrow the screaming cries of the woodpecker the screams and the trills of the kingﬁsher the curious harsh clamour of the and last but by means least the sweet and cheerful whistling refrain of the ﬂycatcher which at frequent intervals emanates from tree in the garden or the mango tope nor is the bird choir altogether hushed during the hours of darkness throughout the year more especially on moonlit nights the shrieking kucha kwachee kwachee kwachee kwachee of the little spotted owlet disturbs the silences of the moon few nights pass on which the dusky horned owl fails to utter his grunting hoot or the jungle owlet to emit his curious but not unpleasant turtuck turtuck turtuck turtuck turtuck tukatu chatuckatuckatuck the above are the commonest of the bird calls heard throughout the year they form the basis of the avian melody in india this melody is reinforced from time to time by the songs of those birds that may be termed the seasonal choristers it is the presence or absence of the voices of these latter which imparts distinctive features to the minstrelsy of every month of the year in january the sprightly little metallic purple sunbird pours forth from almost every tree or bush his powerful song which were it little less sharp might easily be mistaken that of canary from every mango tope emanates loud think of never to be this is the call of the ﬂycatcher culicicapa ceylonensis bird that visits the plains of northern india every winter in summer it retires to the himalayas nesting purposes still more melodious is the call of the which is frequently heard at this season and indeed during the greater part of the year every now and again the green barbet emits his curious chuckling laugh followed by monotonous kutur kutur kuturuk at rare intervals his cousin the coppersmith utters the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https wow and thereby reminds us that he is in the land of the living these two species more especially the latter seem to dislike the cold weather they revel in the heat it is when the thermometer stands at somet hing over in the shade that they feel like giants refreshed and repeat their loud calls with wearying insistence throug hout the hours of daylight the nuthatches begin to tune up in january they sing with more cheer than harmony their being sharp penetrating the hoopoe reminds us of his presence by an occasional soft his breeding season like that of the nuthatch is about to begin the or dhayal who months past has uttered sound save scolding note when occasion demanded now begins to make melody his january song however is harsh and crude and not such to lead one to expect the rich music that will compel admiration in april may and june towards the end of the month the ﬂuty call of the koel another chorister may be heard in the eastern portions of northern india most of the cock sunbirds cast off their workaday plumage and assumed their splendid metallic purple wedding garment in november and december few however not attain their full glory until january by the end of the month it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd cock that is not bravely attired from head to tail in iridescent purple comparatively few birds build their nests in january needless to state doves nests containing eggs may be found at this season at all other seasons it is exaggeration to assert that some pairs of doves rear up seven or eight broods in the course of the year the consequence is that notwithstanding the fact that the full clutch consists of but two eggs doves share with crows mynas sparrow s and green parrots the distinction of being the most successful birds in india the nest of the dove is subject over which most ornithologists have waxed sarcastic one writer compares the structure to bundle of spillikins another says upset box of matches in bush and you will have produced very fair imitation of dove nursery according to third the best way to make an imitation dove nest is to take four slender twigs lay two of them on branch and then place the remaining two crosswise on top of the ﬁrst pair all this the dove nest is wonderful structure it is lesson in how to make little go long way doves seem to place their nurseries haphazard on the ﬁrst branch or ledge they come across after the spirit has moved them to build the nest appears to be built solely on considerations of hygiene ample light and air are sine qua non concealment appears to be matter of importance in india winter is the time of year at which the larger birds of prey both diurnal and nocturnal rear up their broods thro ughout january the vultures are occupied in parental duties the breeding season of these birds begins in october or november and ends in february or march the nest which is placed high up in lofty tree is large platform composed of twigs which the birds themselves break off from the growing tree much amusement may be derived from watching the struggles of backed vulture when severing tough branch its and its tugging cause great commotion in the tree the boughs used by vultures their nests are mostly covered with green leaves these last wither soon after the branch has been plucked so that after the ﬁrst few days of its existence the nest looks like great ball of dead leaves caught in tree the nurseries of birds of prey can be described neither picturesque nor triumphs of architecture but they have the great merit of being easy to see january is the month in which to look the eyries of bonelli eagles hieraetus fasciatus not that the search is likely to be successful the high cliffs of the jumna and the chambal in the the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https are the only places where the nests of this ﬁne eagle have been recorded in the united provinces currie has found the nest on two occasions in mango tree in tope at lahore in each case the eyrie was ﬂat platform of sticks about twice the size of kite nest the ground beneath the eyrie was littered with fowls feathers and pellets of skin fur and bone most of these pellets contained squirrels skulls and currie actually saw one of the parent birds ﬂy to the nest with squirrel in its talons bonelli eagle when sailing through the air may be recognised by the long wings and tail the pale body and dark brown wings it soars in circles beating its pinions only occasionally the majority of the tawny eagles aquila vindhiana build their nests in december by the middle of january many of the eggs have yielded nestlings which are covered with white down in size and appearance the tawny eagle is not unlike kite the shape of the tail however enables the observer to distinguish between the two species at glance the tail of the kite is long and forked while that of the eagle is short and rounded at the extremity the pallas haliaetus leucoryphus are likewise busy feeding their young these ﬁne birds are readily identiﬁed by the broad white band in the tail their loud resonant but unmelodious calls make it possible to recognise them when they are too far of f the white tail band to be distinguished this species is called but it does not indulge much in the piscatorial art it prefers to obtain its food by robbing ospreys kites and other birds weaker than itself so bold is it that it frequently swoops down and carries off dead or wounded duck shot by the sportsman another raptorial bird of which the nest is likely to be found in january is the turumti or merlin aesalon chicquera the nesting season of this ferocious pigmy extends from january to may reaching its height during march in the united provinces and during april in the punjab general rule birds begin nesting operations in the punjab from ﬁfteen to thirty days later than in the united provinces unless expressly stated the times mentioned in this calendar relate to the united provinces the nest of the merlin is compact circular platform about twelve inches in diameter placed in fork near the top of tree the attention of the observer is often drawn to the nests of this species also to those of other small birds of prey and of the kite by the squabbles that occur between them and the crows both species of crow seem to take great delight in teasing raptor ial birds sometimes two or three of the corvi act if they had formed league the prevention of on the part of buzzards kites shikras and other of the lesser birds of prey the modus operandi of the league is two or more of its members to hie themselves to the tree in which the victim is building its nest take up positions near that structure and begin to caw derisively this invariably provokes the owners of the nest to attack the black villains who not resist but take to their wings the angry swearing builders follow in hot pursuit short distance and then ﬂy back to the nest after few minutes the crows return then the performance is repeated and so on almost ad inﬁnitum the result is that many pairs of birds of prey take three weeks or longer to construct nest which they could have completed within week had they been unmolested most of the larger owls are now building nests or sitting on eggs few are seeking food their offspring owls work on silent wing at night they escape the attentions of the crows and the notice of the average human being the nocturnal birds of prey of which nests are likely to be found in january are the brown ketupa ceylonensis and the rock and the dusky bubo bengalensis and coromandus the dusky builds stick nest in tree the rock lays its eggs on the bare ground or on the ledge of cliff while the brown makes nest among the branches or in hollow in the trunk of tree or on the ledge of clif the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https the punjab the ravens which in many respects ape the manners of birds of prey are now nesting raven nest is compact collection of twigs it is usually placed in an isolated tree of great size the indian raven has not the austere habits of its english brother it is fond of the society of its fellows the range of this ﬁne bird in the plains of india is conﬁned to the west frontier province sind and the punjab an occasional pair of kites may be seen at work during the present month some of the cotyle sinensis likewise are engaged in family duties the river bank in which colony of these birds is nesting is the scene of much animation the bank is riddled with holes each of which being the entrance to martin nest is visited score of times an hour by the parent birds bringing insects captured while ﬂying over the water some species of munia breed at this time of the year the red munia or amadavat or lal estrelda amandava is next to the paroquet the bird most commonly caged in india this little exquisite is considerably smaller than sparrow its bill is bright crimson and there is some red or crimson in the in the cock than in the hen and most in both sexes at the breeding season the remainder of the plumage is brow n but is everywhere heavily spotted with white in state of nature these birds affect long grass they feed largely if not entirely on grass seed the cock has sweet voice which although feeble is sufﬁciently loud to be heard at some distance and is frequently uttered the nest of the amadavat is large the size of the bird being cup which is and has hole at or near the narrow end it is composed of ﬁne grass stems and is often lined with soft mate rial it is usually placed in the middle of bush sometimes in tussock of grass from six to fourteen eggs are laid these are white in colour this species appears to breed twice in the october to february and again from june to august the munia uroloncha malabarica is dull brown bird with white patch above the tail its throat is yellow ish white the old name the the plain brown more appropriate than that with which the species has since been saddled by blanford the nest of this little bird is more loosely put together and more globular than that of the amadavat it is usually placed low down in thorny bush the number of eggs laid varies from six to ﬁfteen these like those of the red munia are white june seems to be the only month in the year in which the eggs of this species have not been found in the united provinces more nests containing eggs are discovered in january than in any other month occasionally in january pair of hoopoes upupa indica steals march on its brethren by selecting nesting site and laying eggs hoopoes nest in holes in trees or buildings the aperture to the nest cavity is invari ably small the hen hoopoe alone incubates and when once she has begun to sit she rarely if ever leaves the nest till the eggs are hatched the cock has to bring food to her but to describe the nesting operations of the hoopoe in january is like talking of cricket in april it is in february and march that the hoopoes nest in their millions and call softly from morn till eve of the other birds which nest later in the season mention must be made in the calendar the present month of the indian hirundo ﬂuvicola and the blue pigeon columba intermedia because their nests are sometimes seen in january the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https there perfume upon every wind music in every tree dews the ﬂowers sweets the willis even january in northern india may be compared to month made up of english may days and march nights so may the indian february be likened to halcyon month composed of sparkling june days and cool starlit april nights february is the most pleasant month of the whole year in both the punjab and the united provinces even november must yield the palm to it the climate is perfect the nights and early mornings are cool and invigorating the remainder of each day is pleasantly warm the sun rays although gaining strength day by day not become uncomfortably hot save in the extreme south of the united provinces the night mists so characteristic of december and january are almost unknown in february and the light dews that form during the hours of darkness disappear shortly after sunrise the indian countryside is now good to look upon it possesses all the beauties of the landscape of july save the sunsets the soft emerald hue of the young wheat and barley is rendered more vivid by contrast with the deep rich green of the mango trees into the earth verdant carpet is worked gay pattern of white poppies purple linseed blooms blue and pink gram ﬂowers and yellow blossoms of mimosa mustard and arhar towards the end of the month the trees bombax malabarica begin to put forth their great red ﬂowers but not until march does each look like great scarlet nosegay the patches of sugar grow smaller day by day and in nearly every village the little presses are at work from morn till eve from the guava groves issue the rattle of tin pots and the shouts of the boys told off to protect the ripening fruit from the attacks of crows parrots and other feathered marauders nor these sounds termina at indeed they become louder after dark it is then that the come forth and work sad havoc among fruit of all descriptions the fowls of the air are more vivacious than they were in january the bulbuls tinkle more blithely the purple sunbirds sing more lustily the kutur kutur kuturuk of the green barbets is uttered more vociferously the nuthatches now put their whole soul into their loud sharp the hoopoes call more vigorously the coppersmiths xantholaema haematocephala begin to hammer on their softly and spasmodically in the early days of the month but with greater frequency and intensity the days pass the bird hierococcyx varius announces his arrival in the united provinces by uttering an occasional fever the month draws to its close his utterances become more frequent but his time is not yet he merely gives us in february foretaste of what is to come the tew of the oriole oriolus melanocephalus which is the only note uttered by the bird in the colder months is occasionally replaced in february by the summer call of the liquid musical peeho in the latter half of the month the indian robin thamnobia cambayensis begins to ﬁnd his voice although not the peer of his english cousin he is mean singer at this time of year however his notes are harsh he is merely getting into form the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https feeble but sweet song of the crested lark or chandul is one of the features of february the indian skylark likewise may now be heard singing at heaven gate in places where there are large tracts of uncultivated land in january so in february the joyous think of never to be of the ﬂycatcher emanates from every tope by the middle of the month the pied wagtails and pied bush chats are in full song their melodies though of small volume are very sweet the lar ge grey shrikes add the clamour of their courtship to the avian chorus large numbers of doves vultures eagles merlins martins and whose nests were described in still busy feeding their young the majority of the brown ketupa ceylonensis and rock bubo bengalensis are sitting few of them are feeding young birds the dusky coromandus have either ﬁnished breeding or are tending nestlings in addition to the nests of the owls those of the collared scops owl scops bakkamaena and the mottled syrnium ocellatum are likely to be found at this season of the year the scops is small owl with aigrettes or horns the is large bird without aigrettes both nest in holes in trees and lay white eggs after the manner of their kind the scops owl breeds from january till april while february and march are the months in which to look the eggs of the in the western districts of the united provinces the indian hirundo ﬂuvicola are beginning to construct their curious nests here and there pair of blue colombia intermedia is busy with eggs or young ones in the punjab the ravens are likewise employed the nesting season of the hoopoe has now fairly commenced courtship is the order of the day the display of this beautiful species is not at all elaborate the bird that shows off merely runs along the ground with corona fully expanded mating hoopoes however perform strange antics in the air they twist and turn and double just ﬂycatcher does when chasing ﬂeet insect both the hoopoe and the roller are veritable aerial acrobats by the end of the month all but few of the hoopoes have begun to nest most of them have eggs while the early birds described in january stealing march on their brethren are feeding their offspring the 6th february is the earliest date on which the writer has observed hoopoe carrying food to the nest that was at ghazipur march and april are the months in which the majority of coppersmiths or breasted barbets rear up their families some however are already working at their nests the eggs are hatched in cavity in cavity made by means of the bird bill both sexes take part in nest construction circular hole about the size of rupee on the lower surface or the side of branch is assuredly the entrance to the nest of coppersmith green barbet or woodpecker the month draws to its close many pair of nuthatches sitta castaneiventris may be observed seeking hollow in which to nestle the site selected is usually small hole in the trunk of mango tree that has weathered many monsoons the birds reduce the oriﬁce of the cavity to very small size by plastering up the greater part of it with mud hence the nest of the nuthatch unless discovered when in course of construction is difﬁcult to locate all the cock sunbirds arachnechthra asiatica are now in the full glory of their nuptial plumage here and there an energetic little hen is busily constructing her wonderful pendent nest great is the variety of building material used by the sunbird fibres slender roots pliable stems pieces of decayed wood lichen thorns and even paper cotton the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https are pressed into service all are held together by cobweb which is the favourite cement of bird masons the general shape of the nest is that of pear its contour is often irregular because some of the materials hang loosely from the outer surface the nursery is attached by means of cobweb to the beam or branch from which it hangs it is cosily lined with cotton or other soft material the hen who alone builds the nest and incubates the eggs enters and leaves the chamber by hole at one side this is protected by little penthouse the door serves also window the hen rests her chin on the lower part of this while she is incubating her eggs and thus is able she sits to see what is going on in the great world without she displays little fear of man and takes pains to conceal her nest which is often built in the verandah of an inhabited bungalow the month nears its end the big black crows corvus macr orhynchus begin to construct their nests the site selected is usually forked branch of large tree the nest is clumsy platform of sticks with slight depression lined by human or horse hair or other soft material the reception of the eggs both sexes take part in incubation from the time the ﬁrst egg is laid until the young are big enough to leave the nest this is very rarely left unguarded when one parent is away the other remains sitting on the eggs or after the young have hatched out on the edge of the nest crows are conﬁrmed stealers and and knowing the guile that is in their own hearts keep careful watch over their of fspring the kites milvus govinda are likewise busy at their nurseries at this season of the year they are noisier than usual which is saying great deal they not only utter unceasingly their shrill but engage in many squabble with the crows the nest of the kite like that of the corby is an untidy mass of sticks and twigs placed conspicuously in lofty tree dozens of these nests are to be seen in every indian cantonment in february and march why the crows and the kites should prefer the trees in cantonment to those in the town or surrounding country has yet to be discovered mention has already been made of the fact that january is the month in which the majority of the tawny eagles nest not few however defer operations till february hume states that of the 159 eggs of this species of which he has record 38 were taken in december 83 in january and 28 in february the nesting season of the vulture is drawing to close on the other hand that of the black or pondicherry vulture otogyps calvus is beginning this species may be readily distinguished from the other vultures by its large size its white thigh s and the red wattles that hang down from the sides of the head like drooping ears the nest of this bird is massive platform of sticks large enough to accommodate two or three men hume once demolished one of these vulturine nurseries and found that it weighed over eight maunds that is to say about six hundredweight this vulture usually builds its nest in lofty pipal tree but in localities devoid of tall trees the platform is placed on the top of bush february marks the beginning of the nesting season of the handsome pied kingﬁsher ceryle rudis this is the familiar bird that ﬁshes by hovering like on wings and then dropping from height of some twenty feet into the water below it is bird greatly addicted to goldﬁsh and makes sad havoc of these where they are exposed in ornamental ponds the nest of the pied kingﬁsher is circular tunnel or burrow more than yard in length excavated in river bank the burrow which is dug out by the bird is about three inches in diameter and terminates in larger chamber in which the eggs are laid another spotted bird which now begins nesting operations is the fronted pied woodpecker liopicus mahrattensis species only little less common than the beautiful woodpecker like all the picidae this bird nests in the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https or branch of tree selecting part of tree which is portion of the bole quite close to the woodpecker hews out with its like beak neat circular tunnel leading to the cavity in the decayed wood in which the eggs will be deposited

while under construction may be located with ease woodpecker when excavating its nest will often allow human being to approach sufﬁciently dose to witness it throw over its shoulder the chips of wood it has cut away with its bill in the united provinces many of the pyrrhulauda grisea build their nests during february in the punjab they breed later april and may being the months in which their eggs are most often found in that province these curious ﬁgured little birds are rendered easy of recognition by the unusual scheme of colouring displayed by the upper parts are earthy grey and his lower plumage is black the habit of the is to soar to little height and then drop to the ground with wings closed singing it descends it invariably affects open plains there are very few tracts of treeless land in india which are not tenanted by the nest is mere pad of grass and feathers placed on the ground in tussock of grass beside clod of earth or in depression such the most expeditious way of ﬁnding nests of these birds in places where they are abundant is to walk with line of beaters over tract of fallow land and mark carefully the spots from which the birds rise with february the nesting season of the strix ﬂammea begins in the united provinces where their eggs have been taken early the 17th towards the end of the month the fantail ﬂycatchers rhipidura albifr ontata begin to nest the loud and cheerful song of this little feathered exquisite is tune of six or seven notes that ascend and descend the musical scale it is one of the most familiar of the sounds that gladden the indian countryside the broad white eyebrow and the manner in which with drooping wings and tail spread into fan this ﬂycatcher waltzes and pirouettes among the branches of tree render it unmistakable the nest is dainty little cup covered with cobweb attached to one of the lower boughs of tree so small is the nursery that sometimes the incubating bird looks though it were sitting across branch this species appears to rear two broods every year the ﬁrst comes into existence in march or late february in the united provinces and ﬁve or six weeks later in the punjab the second brood emer ges during the monsoon the of all the birds of to pair towards the end of the month at this season they frequently rise high above the earth and soar emitting plaintive cries the handsome but destructive green parrots are now seeking or making cavities in trees or buildings in which to deposit their white eggs the breeding season the alexandrine palaeornis eupatrius and the paroquet torquatus begins at the end of january or early in february march is the month in which most eggs are taken in april and may the go round and collect the nestlings in order to sell them at four annas apiece green parrots are the most popular cage birds in india destructive though they be and scour ge to the husbandman one can not but pity the luckless captives doomed to spend practically the whole of their existence in small iron cages which when exposed to the sun in the hot weather they often are must be veritable infernos the courtship of pair of green parrots is amusing to watch that of any and not possessing

in all the remaining parts of the united provinces except the extreme south temperat weather prevails until nearly the end of the month in the last days the noonday heat becomes so great that many persons close their bungalows several hours daily to keep them cool the outer temperature rising to ninety in the shade at night however the temperature drops to in the extreme south of the province the hot weather sets in by the middle of march the sky assumes brazen aspect and at midday the country is swept by westerly winds which seem to come from titanic blast furnace the spring crops grow more golden day by day the mustard is the ﬁrst to ripen the earlier ﬁelds are harvested in march in the eastern and southern parts of the country the spring cereals are cut by hand sickles the grain

blows very hot it ﬂags somewhat but even when the temperature is nearer than some avian brawlers are present soon the ﬁrst touch of the afternoon coolness is felt the clamour acquires fresh vigour and does not cease until the sun has set in dusty haze and the spotted owlets have emer ged and begun to cackle and call is their wont these last are by means the only birds that hold concert parties during the hours of darkness in open country the jungle owlet and the owl call at intervals and the indian nightjar caprimulgus asiaticus imitates the sound of stone skimming over ice in the forest tracts franklin and horsﬁeld nightjars make the welkin ring scarce has the sun disappeared below the horizon when the former issues forth and utters its harsh tweet horsﬁeld nightjar emer ges few minutes later and some hours after dusk and several before dawn it utters incessantly its loud monotonous chuck chuck chuck chuck chuck which has been aptly compared to the sound made by striking plank sharply with hammer march is the month in which the majority of the shrikes or butcher go there is false modesty about butcher they are not ashamed to introduce their unmelodious calls into the avian chorus but they are mild offenders in comparison with the dicrurus ater and the rollers coracias indica the little black are at all seasons noisy and vivacious from the end of february until the rains have set in they are positively uproarious two or three of them love to sit on telegraph wire or bare branch of tree and hold concert the ﬁrst performer draws itself up to its full heigh t and then gives vent to harsh cries before it has had time to deliver itself of all it has to sing an impatient neighbour joins in and tries to shout it down the concert may last half an hour or longer the scene is shifted from time to time the participants become too excited to sit still the so engaged appear to be selecting their mates nevertheless does not begin before the end of april some human beings may fail to notice the courtship of the but none can be so deaf and blind to miss the of the gorgeous roller or blue jay has not everyone marvelled at the hoarse cries and rasping screams which emanate from the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https they ﬂing themselves into the air and ascend and descend though they were being tossed about by unseen hands their wonderful aerial performances go on continually in the hours of daylight throughout the months of march and april at this season the birds beautiful although they be are veritable nuisance and most people gratefully welcome the comparative quiet that supervenes after the eggs have been laid the madness of the march hare is mild compared with that of the march roller it is difﬁcult to realise that the harsh and cries of these birds denote not rage but joy the great exodus of the winter visitors from the plains of india begins in march it continues until by which time the last of the migratory birds will have reached its distant breeding ground this exodus is usually preceded by the gathering into ﬂocks of the starlings and the large noisy congregations of these birds are striking feature of february in bombay of march in the united provinces and of april in the punjab starlings spend most of their lives in the plains of india going to asia minor few months each summer nesting purposes in the autumn they spread themselves over the greater part of hindustan most abundantly in the deccan in the third or fourth week of february the rosy starlings of bombay begin to form ﬂocks these make merry among the ﬂowers of the coral tree which appear ﬁrst in south india and last in the punjab the noisy ﬂocks journey northwards in leisurely manner timing their arrival at each place simultaneously with the ﬂowering of the coral trees they feed on the nectar provided by these ﬂowers and those of the tree they also take toll of the ripening corn and of the mulberries which are now in season thus the rosy starlings reach allahabad about the second week in march and lahore some ﬁfteen days later the head neck breast wings and tail of the rosy starling are glossy black and the remainder of the plumage is pale salmon in the hen and the young cock and faint colour in the adult cock rosy starlings feed chieﬂy in the morning and the late afternoon during the hottest part of the day they perch in trees and hold concert if such term may be applied to torrent of sibilant twitter buntings like rosy starlings are social birds and are very destructive to grain crops these last are harvested the feeding area of the buntings becomes restricted so that eventually every patch of standing crop is alive with buntings the spring cereals ripen in the south earlier than in northern india so that the cheerful buntings are able to perform their migratory journey by easy stages and ﬁnd abundant food all along the route there are two species of the emberiza luteola and the headed melanocephala in both the lower plumage is bright yellow among the earliest of the birds to forsake the plains of hindustan are the goose and the pintail duck these leave bengal in february but tarry longer in the cooler parts of the country of the other migratory species many individuals depart in march but the greater number remain on into april when they are caught up in the great migratory wave that surges over the country the destination of the majority of these migrants is tibet or siberia but few are satisﬁed with the cool slopes of the himalayas summer resort in which to busy themselves with the sweet cares of nesting examples of these more local migrants are the and the verditer ﬂycatchers the indian and to some extent the paradise ﬂycatcher and the indian oriole the case of the oriole is interesting all the indian orioles oriolus kundoo disappear from the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https and the united provinces in winter in the former province other oriole replaces kundoo but in the united provinces the oriole melanocephalus comes to take the place of the other from october to march when this last returns to the united provinces in march the greater number of melanocephalus individuals go east few only remaining in the tracts of the province the indian oriole is not the only species which ﬁnds the climate of the united provinces too severe it in winter the koel and the paradise ﬂycatcher likewise desert us in the coldest months from the less temperate punjab several species migrate in october which manage to maintain themselves in the united provinces throughout the year these are the purple sunbird the little green and the and the sparrow the return of these and the other migrant species to the punjab in march is marked phenomenon is the arrival of the swallow and the cuckoo in england in spring the behaviour of the shows the marked effect comparatively small difference of temperature may exert on the habits of some birds in the united provinces the appear to be numerous in winter in summer in the punjab they are very plentiful in summer but rare in the cold weather while not single

its height all the other birds of which the nests have been described namely most species of dove the jungle crow the merlin the purple sunbird the nuthatch the fantail ﬂycatcher the the pied woodpecker the coppersmith the alexandrine and the paroquet the buzzard the collared scops and the mottled the kite the black vulture and the pied kingﬁsher the breed from october to may consequently their nests containing eggs or young are frequently taken in march mention was made in january and february of the indian hirundo ﬂuvicola this species is not found in the eastern districts of the united provinces but it is the common swallow of the western districts the head is dull chestnut the back and shoulders are glistening lue the remainder of the upper plumage is brown the lower parts are white with brown streaks which are most apparent on the throat and upper breast these swallows normally nest at two seasons of the february till april and in july or august they breed in colonies the mud nests are spherical or oval with an entrance tube from two to six inches long the nests are invariably attached to cliff or build ing and although isolated ones are built sometimes they usually occur in clusters many two hundred have been counted in one cluster in such case section cut parallel to the surface to which the nests are attached looks like that of huge honeycomb composed of cells four inches in of kind that one could expect to be built by bees that had partaken of mr wells food of the gods the beautiful kingﬁsher halcyon smyrnensis is now busy at its nest this species spends most of its life in shady gardens it feeds on insects in preference to ﬁsh it does not invariably select river bank in which to nest it is quite content with sand quarry bank or the shaft of kachcha well the nest consists of passage some two feet in length and three inches in diameter leading to larger chamber in which from four to seven eggs are the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https pair of kingﬁshers at work during the early stages of nest construction affords an interesting spectacle not being able to obtain foothold on the almost perpendicular surface of the bank the birds literally charge this in turn with ﬁxed beak by succession of such attacks at one spot hole of an appreciable size is soon formed in the soft sand then the birds are able to obtain foothold and to excavate with the bill while clinging to the edge of the hole every now and then they indulge in short respite from their labours while thus resting one of the pair will sometimes spread its wings an instant and display the white patch then it will close them and make neat bow if to say is not that nice its companion may remain motionless and unresponsive or may return the compliment in the ﬁrst days of march the bulbuls begin to breed in 1912 the writer saw pair of bulbuls otocompsa emeria building nest on the 3rd march by the 10th the structure was complete and held the full clutch of three eggs on that date second nest was found containing three eggs in 1913 the writer ﬁrst saw bulbul nest on the 5th march this belonged to molpastes bengalensis and contained two eggs on the followi ng day the full clutch of three was in the nest the nesting season these birds terminates in the rains the common bulbuls of the plains belong to two molpastes and otocompsa the former is split up into number of local species which display only small differences in appearance and interbreed freely at the places where they meet they are known the madras the bengal the punjab bulbul they are somewhat larger than sparrows the head which bears short crest and the face are black the rest of the body except patch of bright red under the tail is brown each feather having pale mar gin in otocompsa the crest is long and rises to sharp point which curves forward little over the beak the breast is white set off by black gorget there is the usual red patch under the tail and patch of the same hue on each side of the face whence the english name the bulbul molpastes and otocompsa have similar habits they are feckless little birds that build nests in all manner of queer and exposed situations those that live near the habitations of europeans nestle in low bushes in the garden or in pot plants in the verandah small crotons are often selec ted preferably those that not bear score of leaves the sitting bulbul does not appear to mind the daily shower it receives when the mali waters the plant sometimes many three or four pairs of bulbuls attempt to rear up families in one verandah the word attempt is used advisedly because owing to the exposed situations in which nests are built large numbers of eggs and young bulbuls are destroyed by boys cats snakes and other predaceous creatures the average bulbul loses six broods every one it succeeds in rearing the eggs are pink with reddish markings march is the month in which to look the nest of the indian r prinia inornata inornata is very appropriate speciﬁc name this tiny bird which is devoid of all kind of ornament ation its voice is homely its harsh but plaintive twee twee twee it weaves nest which looks like ragged loofah with hole in the side the nest is usually placed low down in bush or in long grass sometimes it is attached to two or more stalks of corn in such cases the corn is often cut before the young birds have had time to leave the nest and then the brood perishes this species brings up second family in the rainy season the strix ﬂammea are now breeding they lay their eggs in cavities in trees buildings or walls in northern india the nesting season lasts from february to june eggs are most likely to be found in the united provinces during the present the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https various species of babblers or seven sisters begin to nest in march unlike bulbuls these birds are careful to conceal the nest this is somewhat untidy cup placed in bush or tree the eggs are beautiful rich blue without any markings the or bird hierococcyx varius to which allusion has already been made deposits its eggs in the nests of various species of babblers the eggs of this cuckoo are blue but are distinguishable from those of the babbler by their larger size it may be noted in passing that this cuckoo does not extend far into the punjab stated above most of the shrikes go in march follows hard on courtship in this month and in april most of the shrikes lay their eggs but nests containing eggs or young are to be seen in may june july and august shrikes are birds of prey in miniature although not much larger than sparrows they are ﬁerce falcons their habit is to seize the quarry on the ground after having pounced upon it from bush or tree grasshoppers constitute their usual food but they are not afraid to tackle mice or small birds the largest shrike is the grey species lanius lahtora this is clothed mainly in grey however it has broad black band running through the escutcheon of the butcher clan it begins nesting before the other species and its eggs are often taken in february the other common species are the vittatus and the shrike erythr onotus these are smaller birds and have the back red the former is distinguishable from the latter by having in the wings and tail much white which is very conspicuous during ﬂight the nest of each species is massive cup composed of twigs thorns grasses feathers and usually some pieces of rag these last often hang down in most untidy manner the nest is rule placed in babool or other thorny tree close up against the trunk three allies of the shrikes are likewise busy with their nests at this season these are the the minivet and the the tephrodornis pondicerianus is an bird of the size of sparrow with broad white eyebrow it frequently emits characteristic soft melancholy whistling note which eha describes be thee cheery how impracticable are all efforts to chain by syllables airy sounds the nest of this species is always carefully concealed in tree minivets are aerial exquisites in descriptions of them superlative follows upon superlative the cocks of most species are arrayed in scarlet and black the hens are not whit less brilliantly attired in yellow and sable one species lives entirely in the plains others visit them in the cold weather the majority are permanent residents of the hills the solitary denizen of the little minivet pericr ocotus peregrinus the least resplendent of them all its prevailing hue is slaty grey but the cock has red breast and some red on the back the nest is cup so small either to be invisible from below or to present the appearance of knot or thickening in the branch on which it is placed sometimes two broods are reared in the course of the in march april or may and the other during the rainy season the grauculus macii is not nearly related to the cuckoo nor has it the parasitic habits of the latter its grey plumage is barred like that of the common cuckoo hence the adjective the is nearly big dove it utters constantly curious harsh call it keeps much to the higher branches of trees in which it conceals with great care its saucer nest we have seen some coppersmiths and pied woodpeckers began nesting operations in february but the great majority not lay eggs until the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https green barbet thereoceryx zeylonicus and the woodpecker brachypternus aurantius are now busy excavating their nests which are so similar to those of their respective coppersmith and the pied to require description it is not necessary to state that the harsh laugh follow ed by the kutur kutur kuturuk of the green barbet and the eterna l tonk tonk tonk of the coppersmith are now more vehement than ever and will continue with unabated vigour until the rains have fairly set in by the end of the month many of the noisy rollers have found holes in decayed trees in which the hens can lay their eggs the vociferous nightjars likewise have laid upon the bare ground their eggs with markings the noisy spotted owlets athene brama and the paroquets palaeornis torquatus are already the happy possessors of clutches of white eggs hidden away in cavities of decayed trees or buildings the swifts cypselus indicus also are busy with their nests these are saucer structures composed of feathers straw and other materials made to adhere together and to the beam or stone to which the nest is attached by the glutinous saliva of the swifts deserted buildings outhouses and verandahs of bungalows are the usual nesting sites of these birds at this season swifts are very noisy throughout the day and at frequent intervals during the night they emit loud shivering screams at sunset they hold high carnival playing at breakneck speed and to the accompaniment of much screaming game of follow the man from cook the swifts are not the only birds engaged in rearing up young in our verandahs sparrows and doves are so employed are the swallows hirundo smithii these last are birds with red heads and white under plumage they derive the name from the fact that the thin shafts of the outer pair of tail feathers are prolonged ﬁve inches beyond the others and look like wires swallows occasionally build in verandahs but they prefer to attach their saucer mud nests to the arches of bridges and culverts with nest in such situation the parent birds are not obliged to go far the mud with which the nest is made or the insects caught over the surface of water on which the offspring are fed the nesting season of swallows is long one according to hume these beautiful birds breed chieﬂy in february and march and again in july august and september however he states that he has seen eggs early january and late november in the himalayas he has obtained the eggs in april may and june the present writer experience does not agree with that of hume in lahore saharanpur and pilibhit may and june are the months in which most nests of this species are likely to be seen the writer has found nests with eggs or young on the following dates in the places may 13th 15th 16th 17th june 6th and 28th the nest of june 28th was attached to rafter of the front verandah of bungalow at lahore the owner of the house stated that the swallows in question had already reared one brood that year and that the birds in question had nested in his verandah some years there is doubt that some swallows bring up two broods such would seem to breed hume says in february and march and again in july and august but many nests containing eggs are found in may some individuals appear to have one brood only which hatches out in may or june those useful but ugly fowls the white scavenger vultures neophr on ginginianus depart from the ways of their brethren in that they nidiﬁcate in march and april instead of in january and february the nest is an pile of sticks rags and rubbish it is placed on some building or in the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https handsome brahminy kites haliastur indicus attired in chestnut and white are now busily occupied either in seeking sites or in actually building their nests which resemble those of the common kite in the open plains the pipits anthus rufulus and the crested larks galerita cristata are keeping the nesting company all three species build the same kind of cup of grass or ﬁbres often deep cup in the case of the crested lark placed on the ground in hole or depressi on or protected by tussock of grass or small bush on the churs and sand islets in the large indian rivers the terns are busy with their eggs which are deposited on the bare sand they breed in colonies on the same islet are to be seen the eggs of the indian river tern the tern the the winged plover and the indian skimmer the eggs of all the above species are of similar appearance the ground colour being greenish or buff or the hue of stone or cream with reddish or brownish blotches three is the full complement of eggs the bare white glittering sands on which these eggs are deposited are often at noon so hot to be painful to touch accordingly during the daytime there is need the birds to sit on the eggs in order to keep them warm indeed it has always been mystery to the writer why terns eggs laid in march in northern india not get cooked currie recently came across some eggs of the tern that had had water sprinkled over them he is of opinion that the incubating birds treat the eggs thus in order to prevent their getting this theory should be borne in mind by those who visit sandbanks in march whether it be true or not there is certainly need the adult birds to keep the eggs warm in the daytime and they spend much of their time in wheeling gracefully overhead or in sleeping on the sand by nightfall all the eggs are covered by parent birds which are said to sit so closely that it is possible to catch them by means of butterﬂy net the terns although they not sit much on their eggs during the day ever keep close watch on them so that when human being lands on sandbank the parent birds ﬂy round his head uttering loud screams the go farther they become so excited that they ﬂutter about on the sand with dragging wings and limping legs if badly wounded sometimes they perform somersaults in their intense excitement the nearer the intruder approaches their eggs the more vigorous their antics become every lover of the winged folk should make point of visiting late in march or early in april an islet on which these birds nest he will ﬁnd much to interest him there in april many of the young birds will be hatched out baby tern is an amusing object it is covered with soft down when human being approaches it crouches on the sand half burying its head in its shoulders and remains thus perfectly motionless if picked up it usually remains limply in the hand so that but its warmth it might be deemed lifeless after it has been set down again on the sand it will remain motionless until the intruder back is turned when it will run to the water fast its little legs can carry it it swims easily duck needless to state the parent birds make great noise while their young are being handled birds decline to be fettered by the calen dar many of the species which not ordinarily nest until april or may occasionally begin operations in march hence nests of the following species which are dealt with next month may occur in the present one tailor common myna brown robin pied wagtail shikra lapwing sparrow blue green pigeon and grey partridge march the 15th marks the beginning of the close season game birds in all the reserved forests of northern india this is none too soon some individuals begin breeding the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https end of the month april the breeze moves slow with thick perfume from every mango grove from coral tree to parrot bloom the black bees questing rove the koil wakes the early dawn waterfield indian ballads the ﬁfteenth of april marks the beginning of the ofﬁcial hot weather in the united provinces but the elements decline to conform to the rules of man in the eastern and southern districts conditions are established long before while in the belt the temperature remains sufﬁciently low throughout the month to permit human beings to derive some physical enjoyment from existence in that favoured tract the nights are usually clear and cool so that it is very pleasant to sleep outside beneath the starry canopy of the heavens it requires an optimist to say good things of april days even in the tract fierce scorching west winds sweep over the earth covering everything with dust sometimes the ﬂying sand is so thick to obscure the landscape and often after the wind has dropped the particles remain suspended days dust haze the dust is scour ge it is it enters eyes ears nose and mouth to escape it is impossible closed doors and windows fail to keep it from entering the bungalow the only creatures which appear to be indifferent to it are the fowls of the air to the heat the species positively revel in it the crows and few other birds certainly gasp and pant when the sun is at its height but even they save short siesta at midday are active in april and may schoolboys set free from april is the month in which the spring crops are harvested soon the holi festival is over the cultivators issue forth in thousands armed with sickles and begin to reap they are almost active the birds but their activity is forced and not spontaneous like most ofﬁcials they literally earn their bread by the sweat of the brow thanks to their unceasing labours the countryside becomes transformed during the month that which was sea of smiling wheat and barley becomes waste of short stubble nature gives some compensation the heat and the dust in the shape of mulberries loquats lichis and cool luscious papitas and melons which ripen in march or april the mango blossom becomes transﬁgured into fruit which by the end of the month is large an egg and will be ready gathering in the latter half of may many trees are in ﬂower the coral the and the dhak are resplendent with red foliage the jhaman the siris and the mohwa are likewise in bloom and ere the close of the month the amaltas or indian laburnum will put forth its bright yellow ﬂowers in great profusion throughout april the air is heavy with the scent of blossoms the shesham the sal the pipal and the nim are vivid with fresh foliage but notw ithstanding all this galaxy of colour notwithstanding the brightness of the sun and the blueness of the sky the countryside lacks the sweetness that englishmen associate with springtime the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https majority of the trees being evergreen not renew their clothing completely at this season and the foliage is everywhere more or less obscured by the dust the great avian emigration which began in march now reaches its height during the warm april nights millions of birds leave the plains of india the few geese remaining at the close of march depart in the ﬁrst days of april the brahminy ducks which during the winter months were scattered in twos and threes over the lakes and rivers of northern india collect into ﬂocks that migrate one by one to cooler climes so that by the end of the ﬁrst week in may the of these birds is longer heard the mallard gadwall widgeon pintail the various species of pochard and the common teal are rapidly disappearing with april ends of the migratory species only few shovellers and gar ganey teal tarry till may the snipe and the quail are likewise ﬂighting towards their breeding grounds thus on the 1st of may the avian population of india is less by many millions than it was at the beginning of april but the birds that remain behind more than compensate us by their great activity the loss of those that have departed there is more to interest the ornithologist in april than there was in january the bird chorus is now at its best the is in full song at earliest dawn he takes up position on the topmost bough of tree and pours forth his melody in continuous stream his varied notes are bright and joyous its voice is of wide compass and very powerful were it little softer in tone it would rival that of the nightingale the is comparatively silent at noonday but from sunset until dusk he sings continuously throughout april the little cock sunbird s deliver themselves of their vigorous song the bulbuls tinkle blithely ever ioras pied wagtails pied chats and shrikes continue to contribute their not unworthy items to the minstrelsy of the indian countryside the robins having by now found their true notes are singing sweetly and softly the are longer content to utter their usual cheeping call the cocks give vent to an exquisite warble and thereby proclaim the advent of the nestin g season the towee towee towee of the tailor more penetrating than melodious grows daily more vigorous reminding us that we may now hopefully search his nest among the less pleasing sounds that ﬁll the welkin are the tonk tonk tonk of the coppersmith the kutur kutur kuturuk of the green barbet and the calls of the various cuckoos that summer in the plains of northern india the calls of these cuckoos although frequently heard in april are uttered more continuously in may accordingly they are described in the calendar that month the owls of course lift up their voices particularly on moonlight nights the nightjars are vociferous they were in march their breeding season is now at its height in the hills the woods resound with the cheerful double note of the europea n cuckoo cuculus canorus this bird is occasionally heard in the plains of the punjab in april and again from july to september when it longer calls in the himalayas this fact coupled with the records of the presence of the european cuckoo in central india in june and july lends support to the theory that the birds which enliven the himalayas in spring go south in july and winter in the central provinces cuckoos at seasons when they are silent are apt to be overlooked or mistaken shikras ornithologists stationed in central india will render service to science if they keep sharp european cuckoos and record the results of their observations in this way alone can the above theory be proved or disproved by the middle of the month most of the rollers have settled down to domestic duties and in consequence are less noisy than they were when courting their irritating grating cries are now largely replaced by harsh tshocks of delight each tshock being accompanied by the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https movement of the tail the cause of these interjections expressing delight is clutch of white eggs or brood of young birds hidden in hole in tree or building april is month in which the pulse of bird life beats very vigorously in india he who braving the heat watches closely the doings of the feathered folk will be rewarded by the discovery of at least thirty different kinds of nests hence it is evident that the calendar this month unless it is to attain very large dimensions must be mere catalogue of nesting species the compiler of the calendar has to face an embarrass richesses of the common species that build in march and the previous months the following are likely to be found with eggs or young jungle crows sunbirds doves pied and woodpeckers coppersmiths hoopoes common and brahminy kites bulbuls shrikes little minivets fantail

ocitta rufa which are nothing else than coloured crows begin they are to be numbere d among the commonest birds in india nevertheless their large open nests are rarely seen the explanation of this phenomenon appears to be the fact that the nest is well conce aled high up in tree moreover the pie possess ing powerful beak which commands respect is not obliged constantly to defend its home after the manner of small or excitable birds and thus attract attention to it fortunately the the kites and crows not worry it the shikra astur badius and the buzzard butastur teesa which are now engaged in are not so fortunate the crows regard them fair game hence their season is time of sturm und drang they in common with all diurnal birds of prey build untidy nests in conglomerations of sticks devoid of any kind of architectu ral merit the blue columba intermedia are busily prospecting nesting sites in some parts of india especially in the muttra and fatehgarh districts these birds nest chieﬂy in holes in wells more often than not stone thrown into well in such locality causes at least one pigeon to ﬂy out of the well in other places in india these birds build by preference on ledge or cornice

telegraph wire or stem of elephant grass and there make cheerful melody the hen is dull bird the nest is usually placed in hole in the ground or bank or wall sometimes it is wedged into tussock of grass allied to the and the pied is the familiar indian robin thamnobia cambayensis which like its relatives is now engage d in nesting operations this species constructs its nest in all manner of strange places spaces in stacks of bricks holes in the ground or in buildings and are held in high esteem nesting sites the eggs are not easy to describe because they display great variation the commonest type has pale green shell speckled with spots which are most densely distributed at the thick end of the egg many of the grey partridges francolinus pondicerianus are now nesting this species is somewhat erratic in respect of its breeding season eggs have been taken in february march april may june september october and november the april eggs however outnumber those of all the other months put together the nest is shallow depression in the ground lined with grass usually under bush from six to nine ured eggs are laid another bird which is now incubating eggs on the ground is the or wattled lapwing sarcogrammus indicus the curious call from which this plover derives its popular name is familiar to every resident in india this species nests between march and august the 122 eggs in the possession of hume were taken 12 in march 46 in april 24 in may 26 in june 4 in july and 8 in august generally in slight depression on the ground occasionally on the ballast of four eggs are laid these are invariably placed in the form of cross so that they touch each other at their thin ends they are coloured like those of the common plover the wattled lapwing sarciophorus malabaricus which resembles its cousin in manners and appearance nests in april may and june the nesting season of the various species of that breed in india is now beginning these birds like lapwings

indian laburnums are in full ﬂower and the air is heavily laden with the strong scent of the nim blossoms but the heat is so intense that the european is able to enjoy these gifts of nature only at dawn nor has the ripening any attractions him he is repelled by its overpowering scent and sickly ﬂavour fortunately the tastes of all men are not alike in the eyes of the indian this fruit is dish ﬁt to be set before the gods the pipal trees which are covered with tender young leaves now offer to the birds feast in the form of numbers of ﬁgs larger than cranberries this generous offer is greedily

and have their being the long day which begins them before 4 rather than the intense heat appears to be the cause of this midday sleep except during this period of rest at noon the birds are more

because in order to so that person would have to traverse india from peshawar to tinnevelly and from quetta to tenasserim nevertheless the man who remains in one station if he choose to put forth little energy and defy the sun may reasonably expect to ﬁnd the nests of more than ﬁfty kinds of birds whether he be energetic or the reverse he can not fail to hear great many avian sounds both by day and by night in may the birds are more vociferous than at any other time of year the ﬂuty cries of the koel and the vigorous screams of the bird penetrate the closed doors of the bungalow to less extent the chatter of the seven sisters the calls of the mynas the towee towee towee of the tailor the whoot whoot whoot of the the monotonous notes of the coppersmith and the green barbet the uk uk

to rear brood of young hopefuls in the chimney or in hole in the roof when this happens the human occupant of the bungalow is apt to be driven nearly to distraction by the cries of the young birds which resemble those of some creature in distress and are uttered with damnable reiteration all these sounds however reach in mufﬂed form the ear of human being shut up in bungalow hence it is the voices of the night rather than those of the day with which may in india is associated most people sleep out of doors at this season and the excessive heat makes them restless they have ample opportunity of listening to the nightly concert of the feathered folk the most notable performers are the cuckoos these birds are fully nocturnal the owls the bird hierococcyx varius is now in full voice and may be heard both by day and by night in all parts of northern india east of umballa this creature has two calls one is the eternal each being louder and pitched in higher key than the previous one until the bird reaches its top note the other call consists of volley of descending notes uttered if the bird were unwinding its voice after the screams of the next cuckoo is not one whit less vociferous than the last it is known the indian koel eudynamis honorata this noble fowl has three calls and it would puzzle anyone to say which is the most powerful the usual cry is crescendo which to indian ears is very most europeans are agreed that it is sound of which one can have too much the second note is mighty avalanche of yells and screams which cunningham has syllabised kúk kuu kuu kuu kuu kuu the third cry which is uttered only occasionally is number of shrill shrieks hekar ee karee karee karee the voice of the koel is heard throughout the hours of light and darkness in may so that one wonders whether this bird ever sleeps the second call is usually reserved dawn when the bird is most vociferous this cry is particularly exasperating to europeans since it often awakens them rudely from the only refreshing sleep they have the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https that obtained at the time when the temperature is comparatively low the koel extends into the punjab and is heard throughout northern india the third of the cuckoos which enlivens the hot weather in the plains is the indian cuckoo cuculus micropterus this species dwells chieﬂy in the himalayas but late in april or early in may certain individuals seek the hot plains and remain there some months they not extend very far into the peninsula being numerous only in the himalayan tracts far south fyzabad the call of this cuckoo is melodious and easily recognised indians represent it while some englishmen maintain that the bird says i lost my love to the writer mind the cry is best represented by the words wher efore wher efore repeated with musical cadence this bird does not usually call much during the day it uplifts its voice about two hours before sunset and continues calling intermittently until some time after sunrise the note is often uttered while the bird is on the wing scarcely less vociferous than the cuckoos are the owls needless to state that the tiny spotted owlets make great noise in may they are loquacious throughout the year especially on moonlight nights nor they wait the setting of the sun until they commence to pour forth what eha terms torrent of squeak and chatter and gibberish almost abundant the spotted owlet is the jungle owlet glaucidium radiatum this species like the does not conﬁne its vocal efforts to the hot weather it is vociferous throughout the year however special mention must be made of it in connection with the month of may because it is not until human being sleeps out of doors that he takes much notice of the bird the note of this owl is very striking it may be likened to the noise made by motor cycle when it is being started it consists of series of dissyllables low at ﬁrst with pause after each but gradually growing in intensity and succeeding one another at shorter intervals until the bird seems to have got fairly into its stride when it pulls up with dramatic suddenness tickell thus syllabises its call turtuck turtuck turtuck turtuck turtuck tukatu chatatuck atuckatuck another sound familiar to those who sleep out of doors at this season is low soft what repeated at intervals of about minute the writer ascribes this call to the collared scops owl scops bakkamoena currie however asserts that the note in question is that emitted by spotted owlets athene brama when they have young he states that he has been quite close to the bird when it was calling little patient observation will sufﬁce to decide the point at issue it is easy to distinguish between the two owls the scops has aigrettes or horns which the spotted owlet lacks the nightjars help to swell the nocturnal chorus there are seven or eight different species in india but of these only three are commonly heard and two of them occur mainly in forest tracts the call of the most of the indian goatsuckers asiaticus the common indian like unto the sound made by stone skimming over ice horsﬁeld goatsucker is very vociferous bird from march till june it is heard wherever there are forests soon the shadows of the evening begin to steal across the sky its loud chuk chuk chuk chuk chuk cleaves the air minutes

forthwith set upon by the pair of little furies and sight is commoner at this season than that of crow kite or hawk being chased by two irate drongos the nest of the is small cup wedged into the fork of branch high up in tree the indian oriole oriolus kundoo is one of the privileged creatures allowed to enter the dicrurian sphere of inﬂuence and it takes full advantage of this privilege by placing its nest almost invariably in the same tree that of the the oriole is timid bird and is glad to rear up its family under the ægis of so doughty warrior the black prince of the birds the nest of the oriole is wonderful structure having selected fork in suitable branch the nesting bird tears off long strip of soft pliable bark usually that of the mulberry tree it proceeds to wind one end of this strip round limb of the forked branch then the other end is similarly bound to the other limb second and third strip of bark are thus dealt with and in this manner cradle or hammock is formed on it slender nest is superimposed this is composed of grasses and ﬁbres some of which are wound round the limbs of the forked branch while others are made fast to the strands of bark the completed nest is nearly ﬁve inches in diameter from below it looks like ball of dried grass wedged into the forked branch the oriole lays from two to four white eggs spotted with dull red the spots can be washed off by water sometimes their colour runs while they are in the nest thereby imparting pink hue to the whole shell both sexes take part in nest construction but the hen alone appears to incubate she is very shy creature and is rarely discovered actually sitting because she leaves the nest with little cry of alarm at the ﬁrst sound of human footfall may and june are the months in which to look the

the plains of bengal the united provinces and the punjab and on the lower slopes of the himalayas the nest is deep cup having the shape of an inverted cone it is always completely covered with cocoons and cobweb it is usually attached to one or more of the lower branches of tree both sexes work at the nest and take part in incubation the long tail feathers of the sitting cock hang down from the

cock and the hen utter sharp tschit may is perhaps the proper month in which to describe the nesting of the variou s species of myna according to hume the normal breed ing season of the common myna acridother es tristis lasts from june to august during which period two broods are reared this is not correct the nesting season of this species begins long before june the writer has repeatedly seen mynas carrying twigs and feathers in march and has come across nests containing eggs or young birds in both april and may june perhaps is the month in which the largest numbers of nests are seen the cradle of the common myna is devoid of architectural merit it is mere conglomeration of twigs grass rags bits of paper and other oddments the nesting material is dropped haphazard into hole in tree or building or even on to ledge in verandah four beautiful blue eggs are laid at peshawar currie once found four myna eggs in deserted crows nest in tree has already been stated the nest of the ginginianus is built in hole in well sandbank or cliff the birds breed in colonies each pair excavates its own nest by means of beak and claw into the holes dug out in this manner the miscellaneous nesting materials are dropped after the manner of all mynas the breeding season of this species lasts from april to july may being the month in which most eggs are laid the or brahminy myna temenuchus pagodarum usually begins nesting operations about month later than the its eggs are most often taken in june the nest which is an untidy odoriferous collection of rubbish is always in cavity in

vent with vigour to their cheerful call which is so pleasing almost to merit the name of song throughout the rains they continue to make joyful noise not that they are silent at other seasons they call throughout the year but except at the breeding period their voices are comparatively subdued the nest is bulky untidy mass of straw roots twigs rags feathers and things it is placed fairly low

able to insert her beak in order to receive the food brought to her by the cock currie gives an interesting account of grey hornbill nest he discovered at lahore in about the middle of april he noticed pair of paroquets nesting in hole in tree on april 28th he saw hornbill inspecting the hole regardless of the noisy protests of the paroquets on the 30th he observed that the hole had become smaller and suspected that the hornbills had taken possession on may 1st all that was left of the hole was slit on may 6th currie watched the cock hornbill feeding the hen first the male bird came carrying ﬁg in his bill seeing human beings near the nest he did not give the ﬁg to the hen but swallowed it and ﬂew off presently the cock reappeared with ﬁg which he put into the slit in the plast ering after he had parted with the ﬁg he began to feed the hen by bringing up food from his crop during the process the beak of the hen did not appear at the slit on may 7th currie opened out the nest the hole was sixteen feet from the ground and the oriﬁce had diameter of three inches all of this except slit broadest at the lower part was ﬁlled up by plaster this plaster was odourless and contained embedded in it number of ﬁg seeds the nest hole was capacious its dimensions being roughly 1 foot by 1 foot by 2 feet from the bottom ﬁve handfuls of pieces of dry bark were extracted three white eggs were found lying on these pieces of bark the sitting hen resented the and having pecked viciously at the intruder tried to escape by climbing up to the top of the nest hole she was dragged out of her retreat by the beak after an attempt to pull her out by the tail had resulted in all her tail feathers coming away in her captor hand the young green parrots have all left their nests and are ﬂying about in noisy ﬂocks they may be distinguished from the adults by the short tail and comparatively soft call most pairs of hoopoes are now accompanied by at least one young bird which is almost indistinguishable from the adults the young birds receive with squeaks of delight the grubs or caterpillars proffered by the parents occasionally pair of hoopoes may be seen going through the antics of courtship preparatory to raising second brood in parties of partridges consisting of father mother and ﬁve or six little chicks wander about the shades of night begin to fall family parties

ents of the birds that breed in the rains the jacanas are acquiring the long tail feathers that form the wedding ornaments of both sexes the various species of egret and the paddy bird all assume their nuptial plumes in may in the case of the egret these plumes are in great demand and are known to the plumage trade ospreys the plumes in question consist of long ﬁlamentous feathers that grow from the neck of the egret and also from its breast in most countries those who obtain these plumes wait until the birds are actually nesting before attempting to secure them taking advantage of the fact that egrets nest in colonies and of the parental affection of the breeding birds few men armed with guns are able to shoot every adult member of the colony because the egrets continue to feed their young until they are shot the plumes of these birds are worth nearly their weight in gold egrets have become extinct in some parts of the world the export of plumage from india is unlawful but this fact does not prevent very large feather trade being carried on since it is not difﬁcult to smuggle ospreys out of the country doubtless the existing notiﬁcation of the government of india prohibiting the export of plumage has the effect of checking to some extent the destruction of egrets but there is denying the fact that many of the larger species are still shot their plumes while breeding in the case of bubulcus coromandus the custom of shooting them when on the nest has given place to more humane and more sensible method of obtaining their nuchal plumes these we have seen

the temperature to fall immediately it is uncommon thing the mercury in the thermometer to sink 20 degrees in few minutes while the rain is actually descending the weather feels refreshingly cool in contrast to the previous heat small wonder then that the advent of the creative monsoon is more heartily welcomed in india than is spring in england sound is more pleasing to the human ear than the drumming of the ﬁrst monsoon rain but alas the physical relief brought by the monsoon is only temporary the temperature rises the moment the rain ceases to fall and the prolonged breaks in the rains that occur every year render the last state of the climate worse than the ﬁrst the air is so charged with moisture that it can not absorb the perspiration that emanates from the bodies of the human

sleepers she has cause alarm if the raging crows catch her they will assuredly kill her such tragedy does sometimes occur not infrequently it happens that more than one koel egg is laid in crow nest the incubation period of the egg of the koel is shorter than that of the crow the consequence is that when usually happens there is one of the former and several of the latter in nest the young koel is invariably the ﬁrst to emer ge it does not attempt to eject from the nest either the legitimate eggs or the young crows when they appear on the scene indeed it lives on excellent terms with its foster brethren but to say this is to anticipate rule neither young koels nor baby crows hatch out until july the centr opus sinensis which are cuckoos that not lead parasitic existence are now busy with nursery duties the nest of the or coucal is massive structure globular in shape with the entrance at one side large the nest is it is not often discovered by the naturalist because it is almost invariably situated in the midst of an impenetrable thicket three or four eggs are laid the storks or birds dissura episcopus are busy at their nests in june these birds build in large trees usually at distance from water the nest is rudely constructed of twigs it is about one and half feet in diameter the eggs are placed in depression lined with straw grass or feathers storks often begin building about the middle of may but eggs are rarely laid earlier than the second week of june nest at the same time of year and they often worry the storks considerably by their impudent attempts to commit larceny of building material the breeding season of the s has now fairly begun these birds usually so solitary in habit often nest in small colonies sometimes in company with the nest is slender platform of sticks placed high up in tree often in the vicinity of human habitations nesting s or they are frequently called utter all manner of weird calls the one most frequently heard being curious gur gle some of the amadavats build nests in june but the great majority breed during the winter months soon the ﬁrst rains have fallen few of the jacanas begin nesting operations but the greater number breed in august this reason their nests are described in the calendar that month in june very striking bird makes its appearance in northern india this is the pied crested cuckoo coccystes jacobinus its under parts are white is bar in the wing the remainder of the plumage is glossy black the head is adorned by an elegant crest the pied cuckoo has peculiar metallic call which is easy to recognise it is difﬁcult to describe the bird victimises not crows but babblers nevertheless the corvi seem to dislike it intensely they dislike koels by the beginning of the month the great majority of the cock bayas or weaver have assumed their wedding garment nevertheless they not rule begin to nest before july the curious excrescence on the bill of the drake nukta or is now much enlar ged this betokens the approach of the nesting season that the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https the monsoon happen to burst early many of the birds which breed in the rains begin building their nests towards the end of june but in nine years out of ten july marks the beginning of the breeding period of aquatic birds therefore the account of their nests properly ﬁnds place in the calendar of that month or of august when the seaso n is at its height july alas creative nature calls to light myriads of winged forms in sportive ﬂight when gathered clouds with ceaseless fury pour constant deluge in the rushing shower calcutta poem in july india becomes theatre in which nature stages mighty transformation scene the prospect changes with kaleidoscopic rapidity the green water earth is time overhung by dull leaden clouds this sombre picture melts away into one even more dismal in which the rain pours down in torrents enveloping everything in mist and moisture suddenly the sun blazes forth with indescribable brilliance and shines through an atmosphere clear crystal from which every particle of dust has been washed away fleecy clouds sail majestically across the vaulted ﬁrmament then follows gorgeous sunset in which changing colours run riot through sky and grey jet black dark dun pale lavender deep mauve rich carmine and brightest gold these colours fade away into the darkness of the night the stars then peep forth and twinkle brightly at the approach of dawn their lights go out one by one then blue tints appear in the ﬁrmament which deepen into azure the glory of the ultramarine sky does not remain long without alloy clouds soon appear so the scene ever changes hour by hour and day by day had the human being who passes july in the plains but one window to the soul and that the eye the month would be one of pure joy month spent in the contemplation of splendid dawns brilliant days the rich green mantle of the earth the majesty of approaching thunderclouds and superb sunsets but alas july is not month of unalloyed pleasure the temperature is tolerably low while the rain is actually falling but the moment this ceases the european is subjected to the acute physical discomforts engendered by the hot steamy oppressive atmosphere the ferocity of the sun rays and the teasing of thousands of biting and buzzing insects which the monsoon calls into being termites crickets horseﬂies mosquitoes beetles and diptera of all shapes and sizes arise in millions if spontaneously generated many of these are creatures of the night although born in darkness all seem to strive after light myriads of them collect round every burning lamp in the open air to the great annoyance of the human being who attempts to read out of doors after dark the spotted owlets the toads and the lizards however take different view of the invasion and partake eagerly of the rich feast provided them notwithstanding the existence of chiks or gauze doors the hexapods crowd into the lighted bungalow where every illumination soon becomes the centre of collection of the bodies of the insects that have been burned by the ﬂame or scorched by the lamp chimney well is it the rest of creation that most of these insects are the span of life of many is but day were it much longer human beings could hardly manage to exist during the rains equally unbearable would life be were all the species of monsoon insects to come into being simultaneously fortunately they appear in relays every day some new forms enter on the stage of life and several make their exit the pageant of insect life then is an one one the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https another and the day after third unpleasant and irritating though these insect hosts be to human beings some pleasure is to be derived from watching them especially is this the case when the termites or swarm in the damp parts of lower bengal these creatures may emer ge at any time of the year in calcutta they swarm either towards the close of the rainy season or in spring after an exceptionally heavy thunderstorm in madras they emer ge from their in october with the northeast monsoon in the united provinces the winged termit es appear after the ﬁrst fall of the monsoon rain in june or july the case may be these succulent creatures provide feast the birds which is only equalled by that furnished by ﬂight of locusts in the case of the termites it is not only the birds that partake the vigilant crows are of course the ﬁrst to notice swarm of termites and they lose time in setting to work the kites are not far behind them these great birds sail on the outskirts of the ﬂight seizing individuals with their claws and transferring them to the beak while on the wing few rows and join them on the ground below babblers toads lizards and other terrestrial creatures make merry if the swarm comes out at dusk often happens bats and spotted owlets join those of the gourmands that are feasting while on the wing the earth is now green and sweet the sugar grows apace the rice the various millets and the other autumn crops are being sown the cultivators take full advantage of every break in the rains to conduct agricultural operations we have seen the nocturnal chorus of the birds is now replaced by the croaking of frogs and the stridulation of crickets in the the birds still have plenty to say themselves the birds scream lustily they did in may and june the koel is if possible more vociferous than ever especially at the beginning of the month the indian cuckoo does not call so frequently formerly but by way of compensation the pied crested cuckoo uplifts his voice at short intervals the whoot whoot whoot of the booms from almost every thicket the iora the coppersmith the barbet the woodpecker and the kingﬁsher continue to call merrily the pied starlings are in full voice their notes form very pleasing addition to the avian chorus those that have not brought nesting operations to close are singing vigorously the are feeding their young ones in the greenwood tree and crooning softly to them at the jhils the various waterfowl are nesting and each one proclaims the fact by its allotted call much strange music emanates from the tank the indescribable cries of the purple coots the curious ﬁxed bayonet s of the cotton teal and the weird mews of the jacanas form the dominant notes of the aquatic symphony in july the or coturnix coromandelica is plentiful in india much remains to be discovered regarding the movements of this species it appears to migrate to bengal the united provinces the punjab and sind shortly before the monsoon bursts but it is said to arrive in nepal early april it would seem to winter in south india it is smaller bird than the ordinary grey quail and has pale on the primary wing feathers the males of this species are held in high esteem by indians ﬁghting birds large numbers of them are netted in the same way the grey quail some captive birds are set down in covered cage by sugar ﬁeld in the evening their calls attract number of wild birds which settle down in the sugar in order to spend the day there at dawn net is quietly stretched across one end of the ﬁeld rope is then slowly dragged along over the growing crop in the direction of the net this sends all the quail into the net very fair sport may be obtained in july by shooting that have been attracted by call birds july marks the end of one breeding season and the beginning of another regards the nesting season birds fall into four classes there is the very large class that nests the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https and summer next in importance is the not inconsiderable body that rears up its broods in the rains when the food supply is most abundant then comes the small company that builds nests in the pleasant winter time lastly there are the such birds the sparrow and the dove which nest at all seasons in the present month the last of the summer nesting birds close operations the year and the mons oon birds begin to lay their eggs july is therefore favourable month moreover the sun is sometimes obscured by cloud and under such conditions human being is able to remain out of doors throughout the day without suffering much physical discomfort with july ends the normal breeding season of the ioras crows paradise ﬂycatchers brown indian robins dhayals winged sunbirds rollers swifts green pigeons lapwings and butcher the paradise ﬂycatchers leave northern india and migrate southwards few weeks after the young birds have left the nest numbers of bulbuls nests are likely to be found in july but the breeding time of these birds is rapidly drawing to its close sparrows and doves are of course engaged in parental duties their eggs have been taken in every month of the year the nesting season is now at its height the storks the koels and their also the various babblers and their fever birds and the pied crested cuckoos the tailor the ashy and the indian warblers the brahminy mynas the swallows the amadavats the sirkeer cuckoos the the water the common and the pied mynas the shrikes and the orioles are all fully occupied with nursery duties the earliest of the birds to be hatched have left the nest like all its family the young cuckoo has healthy appetite in order to satisfy it the unfortunate foster have to work like slaves and often must they wonder why nature has given them so voracious child when it sees babbler approaching with food the cuckoo cries out and ﬂaps its wings vigorously sometimes these completely envelop the parent bird while it is thrusting food into the yellow mouth of the cuckoo the breast of the bird is covered with dark brown drops so that when seen from below it looks like thrush with yellow legs its cries however are not at all thrushlike many of the swallows miniv ets and fantail ﬂycatchers bring up second brood during the rains the loud cheerful call of the last is heard very frequently in july numbers of young are to be seen hawking at insects they are distinguishable from adults by the dullness of the plumage and the fact that the median tail feathers are not prolonged bristles very few crows emer ge from the egg before the 1st of july but during the last week in june numbers of baby koels are hatched out the period of incubation the koel egg is shorter than that of the crow hence at the outset the baby koel steals march on his foster koel nestlings when they ﬁrst emer ge from the egg differ greatly in appearance from baby crows the skin of the koel is black that of crow is pink the ﬁrst two days of its existence but it grows darker rapidly the baby crow is the bigger bird and has larger mouth with ﬂeshy sides the sides of the mouth of the young koel are not ﬂeshy the neck of the crow nestling is long and the head hangs down whereas the koel neck is short and the bird carries its head huddled in its shoulders crows nest high up in trees these facts are therefore best observed by sending up an expert climber with tin of sawdust to which long string is attached the climber lets down the eggs or nestlings in the tin and the observer can examine them in comfort on terra ﬁrma the parent crows not appear to notice how unlike the young koels are to their own nestlings they feed them most assiduously and make great uproar when the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https are taken from the nest baby crows are noisy creatures koels are quiet and timid at ﬁrst but become noisier they grow older the feathers of crow nestlings are black in each sex young koels fall into three classes those of which the feathers are all black those of which few feathers have white or reddish tips those which are speckled black and white all over because each feather has white tip the two former appear to be young cocks and the last to be hens baby koels in addition to hatching out before their foster develop more quickly so that they leave the nest fully week in advance of the young corvi after vacating the nest they squat some days on branch close by numbers of them are to be seen thus in suitable localities towards the end of july at ﬁrst the call of the koel is squeak but later it takes the form of creditable if ludicrous attempt at caw the young cuckoo does not seem to be able to distinguish its foster from other crows it clamours food whenever any crow comes near it of the scenes characteristic of the rains in india none is more pleasing than that presented by colony of bayas or weaver ploceus baya these birds build in company sometimes more than twenty of their wonderful nests are to be seen in one tree this means that more than forty birds are at work and each of these indulges in much cheerful twittering the tree in question presents an animat ed scene both sexes take part in having selected the branch of tree from which the nest will hang the birds proceed to collect material each completed nest contains many yards of ﬁbre not much thicker than stout thread such material is not found in quantity in nature the bayas have therefore to manufacture it this is easily done the building weaver betakes itself to clump of and perching on one of the blades makes notch in another near the base then grasping with its beak the edge of this blade above the notch the baya ﬂies away and thus strips off narrow strand sometimes the strand adheres to the main part of the blade at the tip so ﬁrmly that the force of the ﬂying baya is not sufﬁcient to sever it the bird then swings few seconds in suspended by the strip of leaf not in the least daunted the baya makes fresh effort and ﬂies off still gripping the strand ﬁrmly at the third if not at the second attempt the thin strip is completely severed having secured its prize the weaver proceeds to tear off one or two more strands and then ﬂies with these in its bill to the nesting site uttering cries of delight the ﬁbres obtained in this manner are bound round the branch from which the nest will hang more strands are added to form stalk when this has attained length of several inches it is gradually expanded in the form of an umbrella or bell the next step is to weave band of grass across the mouth of the bell in this condition the nest is often left unﬁnished indians call such incomplete nests jhulas or swings they assert that these are made in order that the cocks may sit in them and sing to their mates while these are incubating the eggs it may be eha suggests that at this stage the birds are dissatisﬁed with the balance of the nest and this reason leave it if the nest at this point of its construction please the weaver they proceed to ﬁnish it by closing up the bell at one side of the to form receptacle the eggs and prolonging the other half of the bell into long tunnel or neck this neck forms the entrance to the nest towards its extremity it becomes very ﬂimsy so that it affords foothold to an enemy nearly every baya nest contains some lumps of clay attached to it jerdon was of opinion that the function of these is to balance the nest properly indians state that the bird sticks ﬁreﬂies into the lumps of clay to light up the nest at night this story has found its way into some ornithological there is truth in it the present writer is inclined to think that the object of these lumps of clay is to prevent the light nest swinging too violently in gale of wind both sexes take part in on after the formation of the at the mouth of the bell one of the birds sits inside and the other outside and they pass the strands to each other and thus the weav ing proceeds rapidly while working at the nest the bayas more especially the cocks are in most excited state they sing scream the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https wings and snap the bill sometimes one cock in his excitement attacks neighbour by jumping on his back this results in ﬁght in which the birds ﬂutter in the air pecking at one another often the combatants close few seconds but neither bird seems to get hurt in these little contests every should make point of watching company of weaver while these are constructing their nests the tree or trees in which they build can easily be located by sending servant in july to search them the favourite sites nests in the united provinces seem to be babul trees that grow near borrow pits alongside the railroad in the rainy season two other birds weave nests which are nearly elegant those woven by the baya these birds however not nest in company they usually build inside bushes or in long grass this reason they not lend thems elves to observation while at work so readily bayas the birds in question are the indian and the ashy the former species brings up two broods in the year one has been mentioned in march and the other in the rains the nest of the indian prinia inornata is except its shape and its smaller size very like that of weaver it is an elongated purse or pocke t closely and compactly woven with ﬁne strips of grass from to inch in breadth the nest is entered by hole near the top both birds work at the nest clinging ﬁrst to the neighbouring stems of grass or twigs and later to the nest itself when this has attained sufﬁcient dimensions to afford them foothold they push the ends of the grass in and out just weaver like the baya the indian does not line its nest the eggs are pale richly marked by various shades of deep chocolate and hume remarks nothing can exceed the beauty or variety of markings which are combination of bold blotches clouds and spots with delicate intricately woven lines recalling somewhat those of our early hammer the ashy prinia socialis builds two distinct kinds of nest one is just like that of the tailor being formed by sewing or cobbling together two three four or ﬁve leaves and lining the cup thus form ed with down wool cotton or other soft material the second kind of nest is woven one this is hollow ball with hole in the side the weaving is not so neat that of the baya and the indian moreove r several kinds of material are usually worked into the nest which is invariably lined the building of two totally different types of nest is an interesting phenomenon and seems to indicate that under the name prinia socialis are classed two different species which anatomically are so like one another that systematists are unable to separate them both kinds of nests are found in the same locality and at the same time of the year against the theory that there are two species of ashy is the fact that there is difference in appearance between the eggs found in the two kinds of nest all eggs are or mahogany colour without any spots or markings many of the indian of which the nests are described in the calendar march bring up second brood in the rains needless to state that in the monsoon the tank and the jhil are the happy hunting grounds of the ornithologist in july and august not less than thirty species of waterfowl nidiﬁcate floating nests are constructed by sarus cranes purple coots and the jacanas the various species of egrets breed in colonies in trees in some village not far from tank in company with them spoonbills cormorants and other birds often nest the breasted waterhen constructs its nursery in thicket at the margin of some village the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https resident ducks are also busy with their nests these are in branches of trees in holes in trees or old buildings or on the ground when describing the nesting operations of waterfowl in northern india it is difﬁcult to apportion these between july and augu st the eggs of almost all such species are likely to be found in the one month in the other few individuals begin to lay in june the majority commence in july but great many defer operations until august there is scarcely an aquatic species of which it can be said it never lays before august nor are there many of which it can be asserted their eggs are never found after july individuals differ in their habit retarded monsoon means that the water begin to nest later than usual the ﬁrst fall of the monsoon rain seems to be the signal the commencement of nesting operations but by means every pair of birds obeys the signal immediately the nearest approach to generalisation which it is possible to make is that the egrets and are usually the ﬁrst of the monsoon breeders to begin while the duck the whistling teal and the jacana are the last in other words the eggs of the former are most likely to be found in july and those of the latter in august the calendar this month has already attained considerable dime nsions description of the nests of all these water is given in the august calendar it is however necessary to state that the eggs of the following birds are likely to be found in july purple coot common coot bronz and jacana black ibis stork cormorant bird cotton teal comb duck duck spoonbill and the various herons and egrets august see the ﬂushed horizon ﬂames intense with vivid red in rich profusion streamed heaven pure arch at once the clouds assume their gayest liveries these with silvery beams fringed lovely splendid those in liquid gold and speak their sovereign state he comes behold mallet the transformation scene described in july continues throughout august torrential rain alternates with ﬁerce sunshine the earth is verdant with all shades of green most conspicuous of these are the yellowish verdure of the rice the vivid emerald of the young plants that have taken root the deeper hue of the growi ng sugar cane and the dark green of the mango topes unless the monsoon has been unusually late in reaching northern india the autumn crops are all sown before the ﬁrst week in august the sugar is now over ﬁve feet in height the cultivators are busily transplanting the better kinds of rice or running the plough through ﬁelds in which the coarser varieties are growing the aloes are in ﬂower their white spikes of drooping ﬂowers are almost the only inﬂorescences to be seen outside gardens at this season of the year the mango the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https over but that of the pineapples takes its place at many of the trees are illumined by hundreds of ﬁreﬂies these not burn their lamps continuously each insect lets its light shine few seconds and then suddenly puts it out it sometimes happens that all the ﬁreﬂies in tree show their lights and extinguish them simultaneously and thereby produce luminous display which is strikingly beautiful fireﬂies are to be seen during the greater part of the year but they are far more abundant in the rains than at any other season in july so in august the voices of the birds are rarely heard after dark the nocturnal music is now the product of the batrachian band ably seconded by the crickets during prolonged break in the rains the frogs and toads are hushed except in jhils and paddy ﬁelds cessation of the rain however does not silence the crickets the ﬁrst streak of dawn is the signal the striking up of the jungle and the spotted owlets hard upon them follow the koels and the birds these call only short time remaining silent during the greater part of the day other birds that lift up their voices at early dawn are the the black partridge and the peacock these also call towards dusk soon the sun has risen the green barbets coppersmiths kingﬁshers and utter their familiar notes even these birds are heard but rarely in the middle of the day nor have their voices the vigour that characterised them in the hot weather occasionally the brown emits few notes but he does so in manner in the early days of august the robins sing at times their song however is longer the brilliant performance it was by the end of the month it has completely died away the indian cuckoo more raises its voice in the plains but the pied continues to call lustily and the pied starlings make joyful noise the oriole liquid ho is gradually replaced by the loud tew which is its usual cry at times when it is not nesting the water being busy at their nests are of course noisy but with the exception of the loud trumpeting of the sarus cranes their vocal ef forts are heard only at the jhil the the rollers the two or three species of warbler s and the perennial singers complete the avian chorus numbers of rosy starlings are returning from asia minor where they have reared up their broods the inrush of these birds begins in july and continues till october they are the forerunners of the autumn immigrants towards the end of the month the garganey or teal quer quedula circia which are the earliest of the migratory ducks to visit india appear on the tanks along with them comes the of the snipe the pintail snipe gallinago stenura are invariably the ﬁrst to appear but they visit only the eastern parts of northern india large numbers of them sojourn in bengal and assam stragglers appear in the eastern portion of the united provinces in the western districts and in the punjab this snipe is rara avis by the third week in august good bags of pintail snipe are sometimes obtained in bengal the fantail or coelestis is at least one week later in arriving this species has been shot early the 24th august but there is general immigration of even the until quite the end of the month the gallinula seems never to appear before september most of the monsoon broods of the indian emer ge from the eggs in august the rains breeding season of the amadavats or red munias is now over and the catcher issues forth to snare the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https consists of some seed and two or three amadavats in one of the wicker cages that can be purchased few annas in any bazaar to the base of one of the sides of the cage ﬂap is attached by hinge the ﬂap which is of the same shape and size the side of the cage is composed of frame over which meshed string net is stretched long string is fastened to the apex of the ﬂap and passed through loop at the top of the cage selecting an open space near some tall grass in which amadavats are feeding the sets down the cage and loosens the string so that the ﬂap rests on the earth some seed is sprinkled on the ﬂap then the trapper squats behind bush holding the end of the string in his hand the cheerful little lals inside the cage soon begin to twitter and sing and their calls attract the wild amadavats in the vicinity these come to the cage alight on the ﬂap and begin to eat the seed the gives the string sharp pull and thus traps his victims between the ﬂap and the side of the cage he then disentangles them places them in the cage and again sets the trap almost all the birds that rear up their young in the spring have ﬁnished nesting duties the year by august here and there pair of belated rollers may be seen feeding their young before the beginning of the month nearly all the young crows and koels have emer ged from the egg and the great majority of them have left the nest young crows are distinguished from adults by the indistinctness of the grey on the neck they continually open their great red mouths to clamour food the swallows swifts pied butcher fantail ﬂycatchers babblers storks weaver common and pied mynas peafowl and almost all the resident water waders and swimmers except the terns and the plovers are likely to have eggs or young the nesting season of the swifts and butcher is nearly over in the case of the others it is at its height the swallows and minivets are busy with their second broods the nests of most of these birds have already been described the indian peafowl pavo cristatus usually lay their large white eggs on the ground in long grass or thick under growth sometimes they nestle on the roofs of deserted buildings or in other elevate d situations egrets cormorants darters openbills and spoonbills build stick nests in trees these birds often breed in large colonies in most cases the site chosen is clump of trees in village which is situated on the border of tank sometimes all these species nest in company hume described village in mainpuri where scores of the birds together with some whistling teal and nested simultaneously after site has been selected by colony the birds return year after year to the place nesting purposes the majority of the eggs are laid in july the young appearing towards the end of that month or early in the present one the nest of the sarus crane grus antigone is nearly always an islet some four feet in diameter which either ﬂoats in shallow water or rises from the ground and projects about foot above the level of the water the nest is composed of dried rushes it may be placed in jhil paddy ﬁeld or borrow pit by the railway line favourite place is the midst of paddy cultivation in some ﬁeld where the water is too deep to admit of the growing of rice two very large white eggs rarely three are laid this species makes attempt to conceal its nest in the course of railway journey in august numbers of incubating saruses may be seen by any person who takes the trouble to look them raoul makes the extraordinary statement that incubating sarus cranes not sit when incubating but hatch the eggs by standing over them one leg on each side of the nest needless to say there is truth whatever in this statement the legs of the sitting sarus crane are folded under it are those of incubating ﬂamingos and other the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https the month of august two of the most interesting birds in india are busy with their nests they are the and the jacana these birds live move and have their being on the surface of tanks owing to the great length of their toes jacanas are able to run about with ease over the surface of the ﬂoating leaves of water and other aquatic plants or over tangled masses of rushes and water in the monsoon many tanks are so completely covered with vegetation that almost the only water visible to person standing on the bank consists of the numerous drops that have been thrown on to the ﬂat surfaces of the leaves where they glisten in the sun like pearls two species of jacana occur in india the motopus indicus and the jacana or the water hydr ophasianus chirur gus they are to be found on most tanks in the parts of the united provinces they occur in small ﬂocks and are often put up by sportsmen when shooting duck they emit weird mewing cries the jacana is black bird with bronze wings it is about the size of pigeon but has much longer legs the species is white bird in winter the tail is short but in may both sexes grow long caudal feathers which give the bird its popular name the jacana does not grow these long tail feathers the nests of jacanas are truly wonderful structures they are just ﬂoating pads of rushes and leaves of aquatic plants sometimes practically the whole of the pad is under water so that the eggs appear to be resting on the surface of the tank the nest of the winged species is usually larger and more massive than that of the water the latter nest is sometimes so small hardly to be able to contain the little shallow circular cup of rushes and water or ﬂoating lotus leaves or tufts of water grass the eggs of the two species show but little similarity both however are very beautiful and remarkable the eggs of the jacana have rich bronze background on which black lines are scribbled in inextricable confusio n so that the egg looks though arabic texts had been scrawled over it this species might well be called the arabic the eggs of the water are in shape like pegtops without the peg they are of dark rich colour and devo id of any markings the nest of the handsome but noisy purple coot porphyrio poliocephalus is platform of rushes and reeds which is sometimes placed on the ground in rice ﬁeld but is more often ﬂoating and is then tethered to tree or some other object from six to ten eggs are laid these are very beautiful objects the ground colour is delicate pink this is spotted and blotched with crimson beneath these spots there are clouds of pale purple which have the appearance of lying beneath the surface of the shell the water gallinula phoenicura is bird that must be familiar to all one pair at least is to be found in every village which boasts of tank and bamboo clump matter how small these be the water is black bird about the size of the average bazaar fowl with white face throat and breast it carries its short tail almost erect and under this is patch of feathers during most seasons of the year it is silent bird but from until the end of the monsoon it is exceedingly noisy and were it in the habit of haunting our gardens and compounds its cries would attract much attention those of the koel and the bird however water are conﬁned to tiny hamlets situated far away from cities many people are not acquainted with their calls which eha describes roars hiccups and cackles the nest is built in bamboo clump or other dense thicket the eggs are with spots of brown red and purple the young birds when ﬁrst hatched are covered with black down and look like little black ducklings they can run swim and dive soon they leave the egg little parties of them are to be seen at the edge of most village tanks in the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https resident ducks are all busy with their nests the majority of them lay their eggs in july so that in august they are occupied with their young the nettopus coromandelianus usually lays its eggs in hole in mango or other tree the hollow is sometimes lined with feathers and twigs it is not very high up rule from six to twelve feet above the ground being the usual level the tree selected the nesting site is not necessarily close to water thirteen or fourteen eggs seem to be the usual clutch but many twenty have been taken from one nest young teal when they emer ge from the egg can swim and walk but they are unable to ﬂy european seems to have actually observed the process whereby they get from the nest to the ground or the water it is generally believed that the parent birds carry them stuart baker writes that very intelligent native once told him that early one morning before it was light he was ﬁshing in tank when he saw bird ﬂutter heavily into the water from tree in front of him and some twenty paces distant the bird return ed to the tree and again with much beating of the wings ﬂuttered down to the surface of the tank this performance was repeated again and again at intervals of some minutes at ﬁrst the native could only make out that the cause of the commotion was bird of some kind but after few minutes he remaining crouched among the reeds and bushes saw distinctly that it was and that each time it ﬂopped into the water and rose again it left gosling behind it the young ones were carried somehow in the feet but the parent bird seemed to ﬁnd the carriage of its offspring easy matter it ﬂew with difﬁculty and fell into the water with considerable force august is the month in which some fortunate observer will one year be able to conﬁrm or refute this story the or nukta sarcidiornis melanotus which looks more like freak of some domesticated breed than one of nature own creatures makes in july or august nest of grass and sticks in hole in tree or in the fork of stout branch sometime s disused nests of other species are utilised about dozen eggs is the usual number of the clutch but anderson once found nest containing fewer than forty eggs the lesser dendr ocygna javanica usually builds its nest in hollow in tree sometimes it makes use of the deserted nursery of another species and there are many cases on record of the nest being on the ground bund or piece of high ground in jhil eight or ten eggs are laid the little grebe or dabchick podiceps albipennis is another species that lays in july or august this bird which looks like miniature duck without tail must be familiar to since at least one pair are to be seen on almost every pond or tank in northern india although permanent residents in this country little grebes leave in the rains those tanks that not afford plenty of cover and betake themselves to jhil where vegetation is luxuriant the nest like that of other species that build ﬂoating cradles is tangle of weeds and rushes when the incubating bird leaves the nest she invariably covers the white eggs with wet weeds and hume remarks it is almost impossible to catch the old bird on the nest or to take her so much by surprise not to allow her time to cover up the eggs matter of fact these birds spend very little time upon the nest in the the sun rays are powerful enough not only to supply the heat necessary incubation but to bake the eggs this contr etemps however is avoided by placing wet weeds on the eggs and by the general moisture of the nest better idea of the heat of india during the monsoon can be furnished than that afforded by the case of some eggs taken by friend of the writer in august he found clutch of four eggs not having leisure at the time to blow them he placed them in bowl on the mantelshelf on the evening of the following day he heard some squeaks but thinking that these sounds emanated from or one of the other numerous tenants of every indian bungalow paid little heed to them when however the same sounds were heard some hours later and appeared to emanate from the mantelpiece he went to the bowl and lo and behold two young egrets had emer ged the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https were at once fed they lived three days and appeared to be in good health when they suddenly gave up the ghost septem ber and sweet it is by lonely meres to sit with heart and soul awake where lie aﬂoat each anchored like fairy boat amid some fabled elﬁn lake to see the birds ﬂit to and fro along the reedy edge mary howitt september is month many people assert that it is the most unpleasant and unhealthy season of the year malarial and muggy though it is september scarcely merits all the evil epithets that are applied to it the truth is that after the torrid days of the hot weather and the humid heat of the rainy season the european is thoroughly weary of his tropical surroundings his vitality is at low ebb he is languid and irritable thus he complains bitterly of the climate of september notwithstanding the fact that it is distinct improvement on that of the two preceding months in the early part of the month the weather differs little from that of july and august the days are somewhat shorter and the sun rays somewhat less powerful in consequence the average temperature is slightly lower normally the rains cease in the second half of the month then the sky resumes the ﬂeckless blueness which characterises it during the greater part of the year the blue of the sky is more pure and more intense in september than at other times except during breaks in the monsoon because the rain has washed from the atmosphere the myriads of specks of dust that are usually suspended in it the cessation of the rains is followed by period of steamy heat the moisture of the air gradually diminishes the temperature rises but each september day is shorter than the one before it and hour by hour the rays of the sun part with some of their power towards the end of the month the nights are cooler than they have been some time at sunset the village smoke begins to hang low in diaphanous sure sign of the approaching cold weather the night dews are heavy in the morning the blades of grass and the webs of the spiders are bespangled with pearly dewdrops cool zephyrs greet the rising sun at dawn there is in the last days of the month touch of cold in the air the indian countryside displays greenness which is almost not quite like because the ﬁerce greens induced by the monsoon rains are not of the same hues those of the young leaves of spring the foliage is almost entirely free from dust this fact adds to the vernal appearance of the landscape the jhils and tanks are ﬁlled with water and being overgrown with luxuriant vegetation enhance the beauty of the scene but almost immediately after the cessat ion of the rains the country begins to assume its usual look day by day the grass loses little of its greenness the earth dries up gradually and its surface once more becomes dusty the dust is carried to the foliage on which it settles subduing the natural greenery of the leaves sooner the rains the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https the rivers begin to fall by november most of them will be sandy wastes in which the insigniﬁcant stream is almost lost to view the mimosas ﬂower in september their yellow spherical blossoms are rendered pale by contrast with the deep gold hue of the blooms of the san hemp which now form conspicuous feature of the landscape in many districts the cork trees millingtonia hortensis become bespangled with hanging clusters of white ﬂowers that give out fragrant perfume at night the of the autumn harvest are being gathered in acre upon acre of the sown rice falls before the sickle the once again become the scene of animation the fallow ﬁelds are being prepared the spring crops and the sowing of the grain is beginning throughout the month insect life is rich and varied it was in july and august the bird and the koel call so seldom in september that their cries when heard cause surprise the voice of the pied longer falls upon the ear nor does the song of the the green barbets lift up their voices fairly frequently but it is only on rare occasion s that their on their anvils the pied mynas are far less vociferous than they were in july and august by the end of september the bird chorus has assumed its winter form except that the ﬂycatchers have not joined it in numbers apart from the sharp notes of the warblers the cooing of the doves the hooting of the the wailing of the kites the cawing of the crows the screaming of the green parrots the chattering of the mynas and the seven sisters the trumpeting of the sarus cranes and the clamouring of the lapwings almost the only bird voices commonly heard are those of the fantail ﬂycatcher the amadavat the wagtail the oriole the roller and the sunbird the cock sunbirds are singing brilliantly although they are still wearing their workaday garments which are quaker brown save one purple streak along the median line of the breast and abdomen many birds are beginning to moult they are casting off worn feathers and assuming the new ones that will keep them warm during the cool winter months with most birds the new feathers grow fast the old ones fall out in few however the process of renewal does not keep pace with that of shedding the result is that the moulting bird presents mangy appearance the mynas afford conspicuous examples of this when moulting their necks often become almost nude so that the birds bear some resemblance to miniature vultures great changes in the avifauna take place in september the sparrows the koels the sunbirds the the red and the majority of the leave the punjab from the united provinces there is large exodus of birds koels pied paradise ﬂycat chers and indian orioles these last are replaced by orioles in the united provinces but not in the punjab on the other hand the great autumnal immigration takes place throughout the month before september is half over the migratory wagtails begin to appear like most birds they travel by night when migrating they arrive in silence but on the morning of their coming the observer can not fail to notice their cheerful little notes which like the hanging of the village smoke are to be numbered among the signs of the approach of winter the three species that visit india in the largest numbers are the white motacilla alba the masked personata and the grey wagtail melanope in bengal the the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https are largely replaced by the wagtail leucopsis the names white and grey are not very happy ones the white species is grey bird with white face and some black on the head and breast the masked wagtail is very difﬁcult to distinguish from the white species differing in having less white and more black on the head and face the white constituting the mask the grey wagtail has the upper plumage grey and the lower parts sulphur the three species arrive almost simultaneously but the experience of the writer is that the grey bird usually comes day or two before his cousins on one of the last ten days of september the ﬁrst batch of indian redstarts ruticilla frontalis reaches india within twenty days of the coming of these welcome little birds it is possible to dispense with punkas like the redstarts the and minivets begin to pour into india towards the end of september the snipe arrive daily throughout the month with the ﬁrst full moon of september come the grey quail coturnix communis these like the afford good sport with the gun if attracted by call birds set down overnight when the stream of immigrating quail has ceased to ﬂow these birds spread themselves over the country it then becomes difﬁcult to obtain good bag of quail until the time of the spring harvest when they collect in the crops that are still standing thousands of teal invade india in september but most of the other species of duck not arrive until october or even november not the least important of the september arrivals are the migratory birds of prey none of the owls seem to migrate nor the vultures but large proportion of the diurnal raptores leaves the plains of india in the spring to every migratory species of raptorial bird that captures living quarry there is migratory counterpart or near relative it would almost seem if each species were broken up into two migratory and stationary one thus of each of the following pairs of birds the is migratory and the other the and the tawny eagle the large indian and the common kite the and the buzzard the sparr and the shikra the peregrine and the lugger falcon the common and the merlin the kestrel and the kite it is tempting to formulate the theory that the raptores are migratory or the reverse according or not they prey on birds of passage and that the former migrate merely in order to follow their quarry certain facts seem to bear out this theory the peregrine falcon which feeds largely on ducks is migratory while the lugger bird not particularly addicted to in india throughout the year the necessity of following their favourite quarry may account the migratory habits of some birds of prey but it does not apply to all thus the osprey which feeds almost exclusively on ﬁsh is merely winter visitor to india again there is the kestrel this preys on rats and mice nevertheless it leaves the plains in the hot weather and goes to the himalayas to breed all the species of birds of prey cited above migratory begin to arrive in the plains of india in september the merlins come only into the punjab but most of the other raptores spread over the whole of india the various species of harrier make their appearance in september these are birds that can not fail to attract attention they usually ﬂy slowly few feet above the surface of the earth so that they can drop suddenly on their quarry they squat on the ground when resting but their wings are long and their bodies light so that they not need much rest those who shoot duck have occasion often to say hard things of the the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https peregrine falcon because these birds are apt to come unbidden guests to the shoot and carry of f wounded duck and teal before the shikari has time to retrieve them of the migratory birds of prey the kestre l is perhaps the ﬁrst to arrive the osprey and the peregrine falcon are among the last very few observations of the comings and the goings of the various raptorial birds have been recorded in the present state of our knowledge it is not possible to compile an accurate table showing the usual order in which the various species appear this is subject to which those persons who dwell permanently in one place might with advantage direct their attention regards nesting operations september is not month of activity on the 15th the close season game birds ends in the government forests and by that date the great majority of them have reared up their broods grey partridge eggs it is true have been taken in september but we have seen grey partridges like doves and kites can scarcely be said to have breeding season they lay eggs whenever it seemeth good to them few belated peafowl may still be found with eggs but these are exceptions most of the hens are strutting about proudly accompanied by their chicks while the cocks are shedding their trains other species of which the eggs may be found in the prese nt month are the munia the comm on and the large grey babblers and of course the various species of dove before the last day of august all the young mynas have emer ged from the egg and throughout the ﬁrst half of september numbers of them are to be seen following their parents and clamouring food most of the koels have departed but some individuals belonging to the rising generation remin d us that they are still with us by emittin g sounds which are very fair imitations of the sqwaking of young crows baby koels are importunate professional beggars and solicit food of every crow that passes by to the great disgust of all but their foster the majority of the seven sisters have done with nursery duties season some ﬂocks however are still accompanied by impedimenta in the shape of young babblers or pied the impedimenta make far more noise than the adult birds they are always hungry or at any rate always demanding food in squeaky tones with each squeak the wings are ﬂapped violently if to emphasise the demand every member of ﬂock appears to help to feed the young birds irrespective of whose nests these have been reared in throughout september bayas are to be seen at their nests but before the month draws to its close nearly all the broods have come out into the great world the nests will remain until next monsoon or even longer monuments of sound workmanship in september numbers of curious brown birds heavily barred with black make their appearance these are that have emer ged from nests hidden away in dense thickets in few weeks these birds will lose their barred feathers and assume the black plumage and red wings of the adult by the end of august most of the and those of the various species of egrets that have not been killed by the are able to congratulate themselves on having successfully reared up their broods in september they lose their nuptial the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https ye strangers banished from your native glades where tyrant frost with famine leag proclaims who lingers dies with many risk ye win the privilege to breathe our softer air and glean our sylvan berries gisborne walks in forest october in india differs from the english month in almost every respect the one point of resemblance is that both are periods of falling temperature in england autumn is the season the departure of the migratory birds in india it is the time of their arrival the chief feature of the english falling of the altogethe r wanting in the indian autumn spring is the season in which the pulse of life beats most vigorously both in europe and in asia it is therefore at that time of year that the trees renew their garments in england leaves are after an existence of about six months they curl up become brown and ﬂutter from their sprays in india they enjoy longer lives and retain their greenness the greater part of year few indian trees example the shesham lose their foliage in autumn the and the coral trees part with their leaves gradually during the early months of the winter but these are the exceptions nearly all the trees retain their old leave s until the new ones appear in spring so that in this country march april and may are the months in which the dead leaves lie thick upon the ground in many ways the autumn season in northern india resembles the english spring the indian october may be likened to april in england both are months of hope heralds of the most pleasant period of the year in both the countryside is fresh and green in both millions of avian visitors arrive like the english april october in northern india is welcome chieﬂy that to which it leads but it has merits of its own is not each of its days cooler than the preceding one does it not produce the joyous morn on which human beings awake to ﬁnd that the hot weather is thing of the past throughout october the sun rays are hot but an hour or two after dawn especially in the latter half of the month the climate leaves little to be desired an outing in the early morning is thing of joy if it be taken while yet the air retains the freshness imparted to it by the night and before the grass has yielded up the sparklin g jewels acquired during the hours of darkness it is good to ride forth on an october morn with the object of renewing acquaintance with nimble wagtails sprightly redstarts stately demoiselle cranes and other migrants in addition to meeting many winter visitors the rider may if he be fortuna come upon colony of that has begun nesting operations the husbandman enjoys very little leisure at this season of the year from dawn till sunset he ploughs or sows or reaps or threshes or winnows the rice yields the of the kharif harvest by the end of the month it has disappeared before the sickle and many of the ﬁelds occupied by it have been sown with gram the hemp san is the next crop to mature in some parts of northern india the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https yellow ﬂowers are the most conspicuous feature of the autumn landscape they are brilliantly coloured broom the san plant is not allowed to display its gilded blooms long it is cut down in the prime of life and cast into village pond there to soak the harvesting of the various millets the picking of the cotton and the sowing of the wheat barley gram and poppy begin before the close of the month the sugar the arhar and the rice are not yet ready the sickle those crops will be cut in november and december in september so in october the birds are less vociferous than they were in the spring and the hot weather during the earlier part of the month the notes of the koel and the bird are heard on rare occasions before october has given place to november these noisy birds cease to trouble the pied starlings have become comparatively subdued their joyful melody is longer notable feature of the avian chorus in the ﬁrst half of the month the green barbets utter their familiar cries at frequent intervals the weather grows colder they call less often but at season of the year they cease altogether to raise their voices the tonk tonk tonk of the coppersmith is rarely heard in october during the greater part of the cold weather this barbet is silent creature reminding us of its presence now and then by calling out wow softly if half ashamed at the sound of its voice the oriole now utters its winter note tew and that sound is heard only occasionally it is unnecessary to state that the peren crows kites doves pies tailor green parrots jungle and spotted noisy throughout the month the longer utter the soft notes which they seem to keep the rainy season but before settling down to the sober delights of the winter some individuals become almost lively and vociferou s they were in the nesting season likewise some pairs of blue jays behave in september and october though they were about to recommence courtship they perform strange evolutions in the air and emit harsh cries but these lead to nothing after few days of noisy behaviour the birds resume their more normal habits the hoopoes have been silent some time but in october few of them take up their and utter it with almost much vigour they did in march it would thus seem that the change of season the approach of winter has stimulating inﬂuence on rollers and hoopoes causing the energy latent within them suddenly to become active and to manifest itself in the form of song or dance in october the pied chat and the frequently make sweet melody throughout the month the cock sunbirds sing lustily and almost brilliantly canaries many of them are beginning to reassume the iridescent purple plumage which they doffed some time ago from every mango tope emanates the cheerful lay of the fantail ﬂycatcher and the lively think of never to be of the ﬂycatcher amada vats sing sweet little songs without words they ﬂit about among the tall grasses in the early morning and at eventide the give vent to their hoot preceded by curious guttural the young ones that left the nest some weeks ago are rapidly losing their barred plumage and are assuming the appearance of the adult by the middle of november very few immature are seen migration and moulting are the chief events in the feathered world at the present season the ﬂood of autumn immigration which arose tiny stream in august and increased in volume nightly throughout september becomes in october mighty river on the bosom of which millions of birds are borne day by day the avian population of the jhils increases at the beginning of the month the garganey teal are almost the only migratory ducks to be seen on them by the ﬁrst the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https brahminy duck gadwall common teal widgeon shovellers and the various species of pochard abound with the duck come demoiselle cranes curlews storks and sandpipers of various species the geese and the pintail ducks however not return to india until november these are the last of the regular winter visitors to come and the ﬁrst to go the various kinds of birds of prey which began to appear in september continue to arrive throughout the present month and ﬂycat chers minivets hes and swallows pour into the plains from the himalayas while from beyond those mountains come redstarts wagtails starlings buntings quail and snipe along with the other migrants come numbers of rooks and jackdaws these not venture far into india they conﬁne themselves to the est frontier province and the punjab where they remain during the greater part of the winter the exodus from the provinces of the sunbirds sparrows orioles red and paradise ﬂycatchers is complete by the end of october the above are by means the only birds that under go local migration the great majority of species probably move about in methodical manner in the course of the year great deal of local migration is overlooked because the birds that move away from locality are replaced by others of their kind that come from other places during spell of exceptionally cold weather great many himalayan birds are driven by the snow into the plains of india where they remain few days or weeks some of these migrants are noticed in the calendar december in october the annual moult of the birds is completed so that clothed in their warm new feathers they are ready winter some time before it comes in the case of the redstart the most of the wagtails and some other species the moult completely changes the colouring of the bird the reason of this is that the edges of the new feathers are not of the same colour the inner parts only the margins show because the feathers of bird overlap like slates on roof or the scales of ﬁsh after time the edges of the new feathers become worn away and then the deeper parts begin to show so that the bird gradually resumes the appearance it had before the moult when the redstarts reach india in september most of the cocks are grey birds becau of the grey margins to their feathers by the middle of april when they begin to depart many of them are black the grey margins of the feathers having completely disappeared other individuals are still grey because the margins of the feathers are broader or have not worn so much october is the month in which the falconer sallies forth to secure the hawks which will be employed in the sport of kings during the cold weather there are several methods of catching birds of prey indeed there are of capturing almost every bird and beast the amount of poaching that goes on in this country is appalling and unless determined efforts are made to check it there is every prospect of the splendid fauna of india being ruined the sportsman is bound by all manner of restrictions but the poacher is allowed to work his wicked will on the birds and beasts of the country almost without let or hindrance the apparatus usually employed the capture of the peregrine the shahin and other falcons is piece of cane about the length of the expanse of falcon wings to the middle of this dove of which the eyelids have been sewn up is tied when wild falcon appears on the scene the throws into the air the cane with the luckless dove attached to it the dove ﬂies about aimlessly being unable to see and is promptly pounced upon by the falcon whose wings strike the limed cane and become stuck to it then falcon and dove fall together to the ground where they are secured by the the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https method largely resorted to is to tether myna or other small bird to peg driven into the ground and to stretch before this net about three feet broad and six long kept upright by means of two sticks inserted in the ground sooner or later bird of prey will catch sight of the tethered bird stoop to it and become entangled in the net third device is to catch buzzard and tie together some of the ﬂight feathers of the wing so that it can ﬂy only with difﬁculty and can not go far before it falls exhausted to the ground to the feet of the bird of which the powers of ﬂight have been thus curtailed bundle of feathers is tied among the feathers several horsehair nooses are set when bird of prey of the kind on which the falconer has designs is seen the buzzard is thrown into the air it ﬂaps along heavily and is immediately observed by the falcon which thinks that the buzzard is carrying some heavy quarry in its talons now the buzzard is weakling among the raptores and all the other birds of prey despise it accord ingly the falcon unmindful of the proverb which says that honesty is the best polic y swoops down on the buzzard with intent to commit larceny and becomes entangled in the nooses then both buzzard and falcon fall to the ground struggling violently all that the has to now is to walk up and secure his prize october marks the beginning of lull in the nesting activities of birds lull that lasts until february we have seen the nesting season of the birds that breed in the rains ends in september nevertheless few belated sarus cranes and weaver birds are often to be found in october still busy with nestlings or even with eggs the latter usually prove to be addled and this explains the late sitting of the parent october however is the month in which the nesting season of the storks xenor hynchus asiaticus begins if the monsoon has been normal one and the rains have continued until after the middle of september this bird begins to nest shortly after the monsoon rains have ceased eggs have been taken in the beginning of september and late 27th december most eggs are laid during the month of october the nest is large saucer platform of twigs and sticks hume once found one fully six feet long and three broad the nest is usually lined with grass or some soft material and is built high up in tree the normal number of eggs is four these are of dirty white hue novem ber it is the very carnival of nature the loveliest season that the year can show the gently sighing breezes they blow have more than vernal softness bernard barton the climate of northern india is one of extremes six months ago european residents were seeking in vain suitable epithets of disapprobation to apply to the weather they are trying to discover appropriate words to describe the charm of november it is indeed strange that poet has yet sung the praises of the perfect climate of the present the project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https cold weather of northern india is not like any of the english seasons expressed in terms of the british climate it is dry summer warmest at the beginning and the end in which the birds have gotten to nest the delights of the indian winter are enhanced the englishman by the knowledge that while he lives beneath cloudless sky and enjoys genial sunshine his in england dwell under leaden clouds and endure days of fog and mist and rain and sleet and snow in england the ﬁelds are bare and the trees devoid of leaves in india the countryside wears summer aspect the sowings of the spring cereals are complete by the ﬁfteenth of november those of the tobacco poppy and potato continue throughout the month by the beginning of december most of the ﬁelds are covered by an emerald carpet the picking of the cotton begins in the latter part of october with the result that november is month of hard toil the ponies that have to carry the heavy loads of cotton from the ﬁelds into the larger towns by the middle of the month all the san has been cut and the water have been gathered in then the pressing of the sugar begins in earnest the little presses that eight months have been idle are once again brought into use and from ber until the end of january the patient village oxen work

than man is those that winter in england suffer considerable hardship and privation while those that spend the cold weather in india enjoy life to the uttermost consider the birds how they fare on winter day in england when there is foot of snow lying on the ground and the keen east wind whistles through the branches of the trees in the lee of brick walls hayricks and thick hedges groups of disconso late birds stand seeking some shelter from the piercing wind the hawthorn berries have all been eaten insect food there is none it is only in the summer time that the comfortable hum of insects is heard in england thus the ordinary food supply of the fowls of the air is greatly restricted and scores of and other birds die of starvation the covered lawn in front of every house of which the inmates are in the habit of feeding the birds is the resort of many feathered things along with the robins and habitual recipients of the alms of blackbirds thrushes tits starlings

most abundant on some tanks many sixty different kinds of winged things may be counted there are the birds that swim in the deep ducks teal dabchicks cormorants and the birds that run about on the ﬂoating leaves of water and other aquatic jacan water pheasants and wagtails the birds that wade in the shallow water and feed on frogs or creatures that lurk hidden in the herons storks cranes pelicans whimbrels curlews ibises and spoonbills the birds that live among sedges and the snipe purple coots and water then there are the birds that ﬂy great ospreys that frequently check their ﬂight

the grassy plain the fallow ﬁeld or among the growing crops there we ﬁnd bird life in abundance and food in plenty to support it this is not the breeding season therefore the bird choir is not at its best nevertheless the feathered folk everywhere proclaim the pleasure of existence by making joyful noise from the crowded jhil emanate the sweet twittering of the wagtails the clanging call of the geese the sibilant note of the whistling teal the curious of the brahminy ducks the mewing of the jacanas and the quacking of many kinds of ducks everywh ere in the ﬁelds and the groves are heard the

project gutenberg of bird calendar northern india by douglas dewar https week of november onwards ﬂocks of these ﬁne birds may be seen or heard overhead at any hour of the day or night the nesting activities of the fowls of the air are at their lowest ebb in november some thirty species are known to rear up young in the present month opposed to ﬁve hundred in may in the united provinces the only nest which the ornithologist can be sure of ﬁnding is that of the vulture some of the amadavats are still nesting most of the eggs laid by these birds in the rains yielded young ones in september but it often happens that the brood does not emer ge from the eggs until the end of october with the result that in the earlier part of the present month parties of baby amadavats are to be seen enjoying the ﬁrst days of their aerial existence few storks not lay until november thus there is always the chance of coming upon an incubating stork in the present month here and there grey partridge nest containing eggs may be found has been said the nesting season of this species is not the quaint little mites known munias munia malabarica are also very irregular to their nesting habits their eggs have been taken in every month of the year except june in some places indian are busy at their nests but the breeding season of the majority of these birds does not begin until january pallas is another species of which the eggs are likely to be found in the present month if pair of these birds have nest they betray the fact to the world by the unmusical clamour they make from sunrise to sunset the nesting season of the tawny eagle or wokab aquila vindhiana begins in november the nest is typical raptorial one being large platform of sticks it may attain length of three feet and it is usually broad it is long it is about six inches in depth it is generally lined with leaves sometimes with straw or grass and few feathers it is placed at the summit of tree two eggs are usually laid these are dirty white more or less speckled with brown the young ones are at ﬁrst covered with white down in this respect they resemble baby birds of prey of other species the man who attempts to take
