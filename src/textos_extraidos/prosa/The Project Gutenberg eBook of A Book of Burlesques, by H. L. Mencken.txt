of the scales of the ancient ﬂat c ﬂat d sharp g and starts high among the ﬁrst violins and then proceeds downward through the second violins violas and cellos until it is lost in solemn and indistinct mutterings in the then the atmosphere of doom having been established and the conductor having found his place in the score there is heard the motive of brooding or the german commentators call it the quäler ei motiv the opening chord of the eleventh is sounded by six horns and the chords of the ninth which follow are given to the woodwind the rapid ﬁgure in the second measure is solo violin heard softly against the sustained interval of the diminished ninth but the ﬁnal g natural is snapped out by the whole orchestra sforzando there follows rapid and daring development of the theme with the ﬂutes and violoncellos leading ﬁrst harmonized with chords of the eleventh then with chords of the thirteenth and ﬁnally with chords of the ﬁfteenth meanwhile the tonality has moved into d minor then into ﬂat major and then into g sharp minor and the little arpeggio the solo violin has been augmented to seven to eleven and in the end to notes here the inﬂuence of claude debussy shows itself the chords of the ninth proceed by the same chromatic semitones that one ﬁnds in the chansons bilitis but kraus goes much further than debussy the tones of his chords are constantly altered in strange and extremely beautiful manner and has been noted he adds the eleventh thirteenth and ﬁfteenth at the end of this incomparable passage there is sudden drop to c major followed by the ﬁrst statement of the missgeschick motiv or motive of disaster misfortune evil destiny untoward fate 31 32 the project gutenberg ebook of book of burlesques by mencken https graceful and ingratiating theme will give concern to the student of ravel and schoenber it is in fact quite elemental succession of intervals of the second all produced by adding the ninth to the common c g c d certain enharmonic changes its simplicity gives it at ﬁrst hearing placid pastoral aspect somewhat disconcerting to the literalist but the discerning will not fail to note the mutterings beneath the surface it is ﬁrst sounded by two violas and the viol gamba and then drops without change to the bass where it is repeated fortissimo by two bassoons and the the tempo then quickens and the two themes so far heard are worked up into brief but tempestuous fugue brief extract will sufﬁce to show its enormously complex nature pedal point on b ﬂat is heard at the end of this fugue sounded fortissimo by all the brass in unison and then follows grand pause twelve and half measures in length then in the strings is heard the motive of warning 33 34 the project gutenberg ebook of book of burlesques by mencken https of this motive comes the harmonic material much of what remains of the composition at each repetition of the theme the chord in the fourth measure is augmented by the addition of another interval until in the end it includes every tone of the chromatic scale save c sharp this omission is signiﬁcant of kraus artistry if c sharp were included the tonality would at once become vague but without it the dependence of the whole gorgeous ediﬁce upon c major is kept plain at the end indeed the tonic chord of c major is clearly sounded by the against curious triplets made up of f sharp ﬂat and b ﬂat in various combinations in the strings and from it sudden modulation is made to c minor and then to ﬂat major this opens the way the entrance of the motive of lamentation or the german commentators call it the schreierei motiv this simple and lovely theme is ﬁrst sounded not by any of the usual instruments of the grand orchestra but by phonograph in b ﬂat with the accompaniment of solitary trombone when the composition was ﬁrst played at the gewandhaus in leipzig the innovation caused sensation and there were loud cries of sacrilege and even proposals of police action one indignant classicist in token of his ire hung wreath of knackwürste around the neck of the bust of johann sebastian bach in the thomaskirche and appended to it card bearing the legend schweinehund but the exquisite beauty of the effect soon won acceptance the means employed to attain it and the phonograph has so far made its way with german composers that ludwig grossetrommel of göttingen has even proposed its employment in opera in place of singers this motive of lamentation is worked out on grand scale and in intimate association with the motives of brooding and of warning kraus is not content with the ordinary materials of composition his creative force is always impelling him to break through the fetters of the diatonic scale and to ﬁnd utterance his ideas in archaic and extremely exotic tonalities the pentatonic scale is favorite with him he employs it boldly wagner did in rheingold but it is not enough he proceeds from it into the dorian mode of the ancient greeks and then into the phrygian and then into two of the plagal modes moreover he constantly combines both unrelated scales and antagonistic motives and invests the combinations in astounding orchestral colors so that the hearer unaccustomed to such bold 35 36 37 the project gutenberg ebook of book of burlesques by mencken https is quite lost in the maze here example is characteristic passage solo french horn and bass piccolo the dotted half notes the horn obviously come from the motive of brooding in augmentation but the bass piccolo part is new it soon appears however in various fresh aspects and in the end it enters into the famous quadruple motive of sulphur truth schwefelgelbe wahrheit we shall presently see its ﬁrst combination is with jaunty ﬁgure in minor and the two together form what most of the commentators agree upon denominating the zarathustra motive i call this the zarathustra motive following the weight of critical opinion but various inﬂuential critics dissent thus ferdinand bierﬁsch of the hochschule für musik at dresden insists that it is the theme of the elevated mood produced by the spiritual isolation and low barometric pressure of the mountains while moll of frankfurt calls it the motive of prowling kraus himself when asked by fritz bratsche of the berlin volkszeitung shrugged his shoulders and answered in his native hambur g dialect so gehts im leben s giebt gar kein use is life it gives hardly any use to inquire in much the same way schubert made reply to one who asked the meaning of the opening subject of the slow movement of his c major symphony halt s maul du verﬂuchter narr don t ask such question my dear sir but whatever the truth the novelty and originality of the theme can not be denied it is in two distinct keys d major and minor and they preserve their identity whenever it appears the handling of two such diverse tonalities at one time would present insuperable difﬁculties to composer less ingenious than kraus but he manages it quite simply by founding his whole harmonic scheme upon the tonic triad of d major with the seventh and ninth added he thus achieves chord which also contains the tonic triad of minor the same thing is now done with the dominant triads and half the battle is won more over the instrumentation shows the same boldness the double theme is ﬁrst given to three solo violins and they are muted in novel and effective manner by stopping their f holes the directions in the score say mit glaserkitt that is with glazier s putty but the konzertmeister at the gewandhaus herr dur substituted ordinary pumpernickel with excellent results it is in fact now commonly used in the german orchestras in place of putty it does less injury to the varnish of the violins and besides it is edible after use it produces thick oily mysterious far ef fect at the start i have just said the double theme of zarathustra appears in d major and minor but there is quick modulation to b ﬂat major and c sharp minor and then to c major and f sharp minor meanwhile the tempo gradually accelerates and the polyphonic texture is helped out by 38 39 the project gutenberg ebook of book of burlesques by mencken https of the themes of brooding and of lamentation sudden hush and the motive of warning is heard high in the in c ﬂat major against double natural and c the lower strings there follows cadenza of less than measures four harps tympani and single tuba and then the motive of waiting is given out by the whole orchestra in unison this stately motive is repeated in f major after which some passage work the piano and pianola the former tuned quarter tone lower than the latter and played by three performers leads directly into the quadruple theme of the sulphur truth mentioned above it is ﬁrst given out by two oboes divided single english horn two bassoons in unison and four trombones in unison it is an extraordinarily long motive running to seven measures on its ﬁrst appearance the four opening measures are given on the next page with an exception yet to be noted all of the composer s thematic material is now set forth and what follows is stupendous development of it so complex that written description could even faintly indicate its 40 41 the project gutenberg ebook of book of burlesques by mencken https the quadruple theme of the sulphur truth is sung almost uninterruptedly ﬁrst by the then by the strings and then by the full brass choir with the glockenspiel and cymbals added into it are woven all of the other themes in inextricable whirls and whorls of sound and in most amazing combinations and permutations of tonalities moreover there is constantly rising complexity of rhythm and on one page of the score the time signature is changed less than eighteen times several times it is and once it is in one place the composer following koechlin and erik satie abandons altogether half page of the score and these diverse rhythms are not always merely successive sometimes they are heard together example the motive of disaster augmented to time is sounded clearly by the clarinets against the motive of lamentation in time and through it all one hears the steady beat of the motive of waiting in this gigantic development of materials is carried to thrilling climax with the whole orchestra proclaiming the zarathustra motive fortissimo then follows series of arpeggios the harps made of the motive of warning and out of them there gradually steals the tonic triad of d minor sung by three oboes this chord constitutes the backbone of all that follows the three oboes are presently joined by fourth against this curtain of tone the ﬂutes and piccolos repeat the theme of brooding in f major and then join the oboes in the d minor chord the horns and bassoons follow with the motive of disaster and then likewise now come the violins with the motive of lamentation but instead of ending with the d minor tonic triad they sound chord of the seventh erecte d on c sharp seventh of d minor every tone of the scale of d minor is now being sounded and instrument after instrument joins in the effect is indescribably sonorous and imposing meanwhile there is steady crescendo ending after three minutes of truly tremendous music with ten sharp blasts of the double chord moment of silence and single trombone gives out theme hitherto not heard it is the theme of tenderness or the german commentators call it the biermad l motiv thus again silence then single piccolo plays the closing cadence of the composition ruhm und ewigkeit presents enormous difﬁculties to the performers and taxes the generalship of the most skillful conductor when it was in preparation at the gewandhaus the ﬁrst performance was postponed twelve times in order to extend the rehearsals

at hambur g on january 14 at the age of three he performed creditably on the zither corne t and trombone and by 1877 he had already appeared in concert at danzig his family was very poor and his early years were full of difﬁculties it is said that at the age of nine he copied the whole score of wagner s ring the scores of the nine beethoven symphonies and the complete works of mozart his regular teacher in those days was stadtpfeifer schmidt who instructed him in piano and bass in 1884 desiring to have lessons in counterpoint from kalbsbraten of mainz he walked to that city from hambur g once distance the round trip of 316 miles in 1887 he went to berlin and became fourth cornetist of the philha rmonic orchestra and valet to schweinsrippen the conductor in berlin he studied violin and second violin under the polish virtuoso pbyschbrweski and also had lessons in composition from wilhelm geigenhe imer formerly third triangle and assistant librarian at bayreuth his ﬁrst composition march cornet violin and piano was performed on july 18 1888 at the annual ball of the arbeiter liedertafel in berlin it attracted little attention but six months later the young composer made musical berlin talk about him by producing composition called adenoids twelve tenors cappella to words by otto julius bierbaum this was ﬁrst heard at an open air concert given in the tiergarten by the sozialist liederkranz it was soon after repeated by the choir of the gottesgelehrheitsakademie and kraus found himself famous young man his string quartet in g sharp minor ﬁrst played early in 1889 by the quartet led by rudolph wurst added to his growing celebrity and when his ﬁrst tone poem orchestra fuchs du hast die gans gestohlen was done by the philharmonic in the autumn of 1889 under lachschinken it was hailed with acclaim kraus has since written twelve symphonies two choral nine poems suite brass and tympani trio harp tuba and glockenspiel ten string quartettes serenade ﬂute and four concert overtures cornet concerto and many songs and piano pieces his known work perhaps is his symphony in f ﬂat major in eight movements but kraus himself is said to regard this huge work

ehensible changes in the plan and the ushers are now completely at sea all they know clearly is that the relatives of the bride are to be seated on one side and the relatives of the bridegr oom on the other but which side one and which the other they discuss it heatedly three minutes and then ﬁnd that they stand three putting the bride s relatives on the left side and three putting them on the right side the debate though instructive is interrupted by the sudd en entrance of seven women in group they are headed by truculent old battleship possibly an aunt or something of the sort who ﬁxes the nearest usher with knowing suspicious glance and motions to him to show her the way he offers her his right arm and they start up the center aisle with the six other women following in irregular order and the ﬁve other ushers scatter ed among the women the leading usher is tortur ed damnably by doubts to wher the party should go if they are aunts to which house they belong and on which side are the members of that house to be seated what if they are not aunts but merely neighbors or perhaps an association of former cooks parlor maids nurse girls or strangers the sufferings of the usher are relieved by the battleship who halts majestically about twenty feet from the altar and motions her followers into pew to the left they ﬁle in silently and she seats herself next the aisle all seven settle back and wriggle room it is tight ﬁt who in point of fact are these ladie s don t ask the question the ushers never ﬁnd out one ever ﬁnds out they remain joint mystery all time in the end they become sort of tradition and years hence when two of the ushers meet they will cackl over old dreadnaught and her six cruisers the bride grown old and fat will tell the tale to her daughter and

man usually he wears hurried unwilling protesting look he has been dragged from his ofﬁce on busy morning forced to rush home and get into his coat and then marched to the church by his wife one of these men much hustled has forgotten to have his shoes shined he is intensely conscious of them and tries to hide them behind his wife s skirt they walk up the aisle accidentally he steps upon it and gets look over the shoulder which lifts his diaphragm an inch and turns his liver to water this man will be courtmartialed when he reaches home and he knows it he wishes that some foreign power would invade the united states and burn down all the churches in the country and that the bride the bridegr oom and all the other persons inter ested in the pr esent wedding wer dead and in hell the ushers their best to seat these wedding guests in some sort of order but after few minutes the crowd at the doors becomes so large that they have to give it up and thereafter all they can is to hold out their right arms ingratiatingly and trust to luck one of them steps on fat woman s skirt tearing it very badly and she has to be helped back to the 60 61 62 the project gutenberg ebook of book of

past him without noticing him and proceeds grandly to seat far forwar she is cousin to the bride s mother and will make report to every branch of the family that all six ushers disgraced the cer emony

organist who has now reached mendelssohn s spring song the third and last time is accompanied by huge buzz of whispers and there is much craning of necks and nodding and smiling here and there an unusually gorgeous hat is the target of many conver ging glances and of many more or less satirical criticisms to the damp funeral smell of the ﬂowers at the altar there has been added the cacodor ous

stately thing he mistakes it the wedding march from lohengrin and is hot marching upon the altar at once the best man an old hand restrains him gently and administers another sedative from the bottle the bridegr oom s thoughts turn to gloomy things he remembers sadly that he will never be able to laugh at benedicts again that his days of low rabelaisian wit and scofﬁng are over that he is now the very thing he mocked so gaily but yesteryear like drowning man he passes his whole life in however that part which is past but that part which is to come odd fancies throng upon him he wonders what his honeymoon will cost him what there will be to drink at the wedding breakfast what certain girl in chicago will say when she hears of his marriage will there be any childr en he rather hopes not all those he knows appear so greasy and noisy but he decides that he might conceivably compr omise on boy but how is he going to make sure that it will not be girl the thing yet is medical medicine is making rapid strides why not wait until the secret is discover ed this sapient compr omise pleases the bridegr oom and he proceeds to consideration of various problems of ﬁnance and then of sudden the organist swings unmistakably into lohengrin and the best man grabs him by the arm there is now great excitement in the church the bride s mother two sisters three brothers and three have just marched up the center aisle and taken seats in the front pew and all the women in the place are craning their necks towar d the door the usual electrical delay ensues there is something the matter with the bride s train and the two bridesmaids have deuce of time ﬁxing it meanwhile the bride s father in tight pantaloons and tighter gloves ﬁdgets and fumes in the vestibule the six ushers crowd about him inanely and the sexton rushes to and fro like rat in trap finally all being ready with the ushers formed two abreast the sexton pushes button small buzzer sounds in the organ loft and the organist has

maintaining his equilibrium but the bride herself moves steadily and erectly almost seeming to ﬂoat her face is thickly encrusted with talcum in its various forms so that she is almost dead white she keeps her eyelids lower ed modestly but is still acutely awar of every glance fastened upon in the mass but every glance individually example she sees clearly even through her eyelids the still cold

sweet and oh lovely and ain t she pale from the latitude of the last pew to the very glacis of the altar of god while she has thus made her progress up the hymeneal chute the bridegr oom and his best

lower waistcoat pocket the ring is still there the best man wriggles his cuffs one however pays any heed to them they are not even seen indeed until the bride and her father reach the open space in front of the altar there the bride and the bridegr oom ﬁnd themselves standing side by side but not word is exchanged between them nor even look of recognition they stand motionless contemplating the ornate cushion at their feet until the bride s father and the bridesmaids ﬁle to the left of the bride and the ushers now wholly disor ganized and imbecile drape themselves in an irregular ﬁle along

ambassador there tells that it costs million 67 68 69 71 the project gutenberg ebook of book of burlesques by mencken https year to keep up the walls you the walls alone what must it cost to keep up the palace with all that fancy work yes i grant you that brickwork looks good but what of it so does cheap cotton know the gaudy things those theban peddlers sell to my down on the river bank but does it last of course it doesn well i am putting up this pyramid to stay put and i don t give damn its looks i hear all sorts of funny cracks about it my barber is sharp nigger and keeps his ears open he brings all the gossip but i let it go this is my pyramid i am putting up the money it and i have got to be mortared up in it when i die so i am trying to make good substantial job of it and letting the mere beauty of it go hang anyhow there are plenty of uglier things in egypt look at some of those pyramids up the river when it comes to shape they are pretty much the same this one and when it comes to size they look like warts beside it and look at the sphinx there is something that cost four millions if it cost what is it now burlesque caricature an architectural cripple so long it was new good enough it was showy piece of work people came all the way from sicyonia and tyre to gape at it everybody said it was one of the sights one could afford to miss but by and by piece began to peel off here and another piece there and then the nose cracked and then an ear dropped off and then one of the eyes began to get mushy and watery looking and ﬁnally it was mere smudge face scarecrow my father spent lot of money trying to ﬁx it up but what good did it by the time he had the nose cobbled the ears were loose again and so on in the end he gave it up bad job yes this pyramid has kept on the jump but i m going to stick to it if it breaks some say i ought to have built it across the river where the quarries are such gabble makes sick i look like man who would go looking around such child i hope not man could have done that even babylonian could have done it it would have been easy milking cow what i wanted was something that would keep on the that would put strain on so i decided to haul the whole business across the million tons of rock and when the engineers said that it couldn t be done i gave them two days to get out of egypt and then tackled it myself it was something new and hard it was job i could get my teeth into well i suppose you know what time i had of it at the start first i tried pontoon bridge but the stones the bottom course were so heavy that they sank the pontoons and i lost couple of hundred niggers before i saw that it couldn t be done then i tried big raft but in order to get her to ﬂoat with the stones i had to use such big logs that she was unwieldy and before i knew what had struck i had lost six big dressed stones and another hundred niggers i got the laugh of course every numskull in egypt wagged his beard over it i could hear the chatter myself but i kept quiet and stuck to the problem and by and by i solved it i suppose you know how i did it in general way well the details are simple first i made new raft good deal lighter than the old one and then i got thousand water and had them blown up until they were tight drums then i got together thousand niggers who were good swimmers and gave each of them one of the skins on each there was leather thong and on the bottom of the raft spread over it evenly there were thousand hooks you get the idea yes that s it exactly the niggers dived overboard with the 72 73 74 the project gutenberg ebook of book of burlesques by mencken https under the raft and tied the thongs to the hooks and when all of them were tied on the raft ﬂoated like bladder you simply couldn t sink it naturally enough the thing took time and there were accidents and setbacks instance some of the niggers were so light in weight that they couldn t hold their under water long enough to get them under the raft i had to weight those fellows by having rocks tied around their middles and when they had fastened their and tried to swim back some of them were carried down by the rocks i never made any exact count but i suppose that two or three hundred of them were drowned in that way besides couple of hundred were drowned because they couldn t hold their breaths long enough to swim under the raft and back but what of it i wasn t trying to hoard up niggers but to make raft that would ﬂoat and i did it well once i showed how it could be done all the wiseacres caught the idea and after that i put big gang to work making more rafts and by and by i had sixteen of them in operation and was hauling more stone than the masons could set but i won t go into all that here is the pyramid it speaks itself one year more and i ll have the top course laid and begin on the surfacing i am going to make it plain marble with fancy work i could bring in gang of theban stonecutters and have it carved all over with lions heads and tiger claws and all that sort of but why waste time and money this isn t menagerie but pyramid my idea was to make it the boss pyramid of the world the king who tries to beat it will have to get up pretty early in the morning but what troubles i have had believe there has been nothing but trouble trouble trouble from the start i set aside the engineering difﬁculties they were hard the engineers but easy once i put my mind on them but the way these niggers have carried on has been something terrible at the beginning i had only thousand or two and they all came from one tribe so they got along fairly well during the whole ﬁrst year i doubt that more than twenty or thirty were killed in ﬁghts but then i began to get fresh batches from up the river and after that it was nothing but one ﬁght after another two weeks running not stroke of work was done i really thought at one time that i d have to give up but ﬁnally the army put down the row and after couple of hundred of the ringleaders had been thrown into the river peace was restored but it cost ﬁrst and last fully three thousand niggers and set back at least six months then came the labor unions and the strikes and more trouble these labor unions were started by couple of smart yellow niggers from chaldea one of them sort of lay preacher fellow with lot of gab before i got wind of them they had gone so far it was almost impossible to squelch them first i tried conciliation but it didn t work bit they made the craziest demands you ever heard holiday every six days meat every day night work and regular houses to live in some of them even had the effrontery to ask money think of it niggers asking money finally i had to order out the army again and let some blood but every time one was knocked over i had to get another one to take his place and that meant sending the army up the river and more expense and more devilish worry and nuisance in my grandfather s time niggers were honest and faithful workmen you could take one fresh from the bush teach him to handle shovel or pull rope in year or so and after that he was worth almost much he could eat but the nigger of isn t worth damn he never does an honest day s work if he can help it and he is forever wanting something 75 76 77 the project gutenberg ebook of book of burlesques by mencken https these fellows i have young bucks from around the first cataract here are niggers who never saw baker s bread or butcher s meat until my men grabbed them they lived there in the bush like so many hyenas they were ten days march from lemon well now they get class beef twice week good bread and all the ﬁsh they can catch they don t have to begin work until broad daylight and they lay off at dark there is hardly one of them that hasn t got psaltery or harp or some other musical instrument if they want to dress up and make believe they are egyptians i give them clothes if one of them is killed on the work or by stray lion or in ﬁght i have him embalmed by my own embalmers and plant him like man if one of them breaks leg or loses an arm or gets too old to work i turn him loose without complaining and he is free to go home if he wants to but are they contented they show any gratitude not at all scarcely day passes that i don t hear of some fresh soldiering and what is worse they have stirred up some of my own carpenters cutters gang bosses and so on every now and then my inspectors ﬁnd some rotten libel cut on to the effect that i am overworking them and knocking them about and holding them against their will and generally mistreating them i haven t the slightest doubt that some of these inscriptions have actually gone into the pyramid it s impossible to watch every stone well in the years to come

think every american they get hold of is millionaire the f irst m an the french are worse i went into hotel in paris and paid ten francs day room myself and wife and when we left they charged one

thing and if you don t eat breakfast in the hotel they charge you krone it anyhow the f irst m an well well what next but after all you can t blame them we americans come over here and hand them our and we ought to be glad if we get anything back at all the way man has to tip is something fearful the s econd m an 113 114 the project gutenberg ebook of book of burlesques by mencken https t it though i stayed in dresden week and when i left there were six grafters lined up with their claws out first came the porteer then came the f irst m an how much did you give the port eer the s econd m an five marks the f irst m an you gave him too much you ought to have given him about three marks or say two marks ﬁfty how much was your hotel bill the s econd m an including everything the f irst m an just your bill your room the s econd m an i paid six marks day the f irst m an well that made marks the week now the way to ﬁgure out how much the porteer ought to get is easy fellow i met in showed how to it first you multiply your hotel bill by two then you divide it by and then you knock off half mark twice two is into goes about three times and half from three leaves two and half see how easy it is the s econd m an it looks easy anyhow but you haven t got much time to all that ﬁguring the f irst m an well let the porteer wait the longer he has to wait the more he appreciates you the s econd m an but how about the others the f irst m an 115 116 the project gutenberg ebook of book of burlesques by mencken https s just simple your chambermaid gets quarter of mark every day you have been in the hotel but if you stay less than four days she gets whole mark anyhow if there are two in the party she gets half mark day but more than three marks in any one week the s econd m an but suppose there are two chambermaid s in dresden there was one on day duty and one on night duty i left at six clock in the evening and so they were both on the job the f irst m an don t worry they d have been on the job anyhow matter when you left but it s just easy to ﬁgure out the tip two one all you have to is to add ﬁfty per cent and then divide it into two halves and give one to each girl or better still give it all to one girl and tell her to give half to her pal if there are three chambermaids you sometimes ﬁnd in the swell hotels you add another ﬁfty per cent and then divide by three and so on the s econd m an i see but how about the hall porter and the ﬂoor waiter the f irst m an just easy the hall porter gets whate ver the chambermaid gets plus per more than two marks in any one week the ﬂoor waiter gets thirty pfennigs day straight but if you stay only one day he gets half mark and if you stay more than week he gets two marks ﬂat week after the ﬁrst week in some hotels the hall porter don t shine shoes if he don t he gets just much if he does but then the actual boots has to be taken care of he gets half mark every two days every time you put out an extra pair of shoes he gets ﬁfty per cent more that day if you shine your own shoes or go without shining them the boots gets half his regular tip but never less than mark week the s econd m an certainly it seems simple enough i never knew there was any such system the f irst m an i guess you didn very few but it s just because americans don t know it that these foreign blackmailers shake down once you let the porteer see that you know the ropes he ll pass the word on to the others and you ll be treated like native the s econd m an i see but how about the elevator boy i gave the elevator boy in dresden two marks and he almost fell on my neck so i ﬁgured that i played the sucker 117 118 119 the project gutenberg ebook of book of burlesques by mencken https f irst m an so you did the rule elevator boys is still somewhat in the air because so few of these bum hotels over here have elevators but you can sort of reason the thing out if you put your mind on it when you get on street car in germany what tip you give the conductor the s econd m an five pfennigs the f irst m an naturally that s the tip ﬁxed by custom you may almost say it s the unwritten law if you gave the conductor more he would hand you change well how i reason it out is this way if ﬁve pfennigs is enough car conductor who may carry you three miles why shouldn t it be enough the elevator boy who may carry you only three stories the s econd m an it seems fair certainly the f irst m an and it is fair so all you have to is to keep account of the number of times you go up and down in the elevator and then give the elevator boy ﬁve pfennigs each trip say you come down in the morning go up in the evening and average one other round trip day that makes trips week five times is one mark there you are the s econd m an i see by the way what hotel are you stopping at the f irst m an the goldene esel the s econd m an how is it the f irst m an oh ask oatmeal at breakfast and they send to the livery stable peck of oats and ask you please to be so kind to show them how to make it the s econd m an my hotel is even worse last night i got into such sweat under the big german feather bed that i had to throw it off but when i asked single blanket they didn t have any so i had to wrap up in bath towels 120 121 the project gutenberg ebook of book of burlesques by mencken https f irst m an yes and you used up every one in town this morning when i took bath the only towel the chambermaid could ﬁnd wasn t bigger than wedding invitation but while she was hunting around i dried off so harm was done the s econd m an well that s what man gets running around in such countries in leipzig they sat nigger down beside at the table in amsterdam they had cheese breakf ast in munich the head waiter had never heard of buckwheat cakes in mannheim they charged ten pfennigs extra cake of soap the f irst m an what you think of the railroad trains over here the s econd m an rotten that compartment system is all wrong if nobody comes into your compartment it s lonesome and if anybody does come in it s too damn sociable and if you try to stretch out and get some sleep some rufﬁan begins singing in the next compartmen t or the conductor keeps butting in and jabbering at you the f irst m an but you can say one thing the german trains they get in on time the s econd m an so they but wonder they run so slow they can t help it the way i ﬁgure it german engineer must have devil of time holding his engine in the fact is he usually can t and so he has to wait outside every big town until the schedule catches up to him they say they never have accidents but is it any more than you expect did you ever hear of mud turtle having an accident the f irst m an scarcely you say these countries are far behind the times i saw ﬁre in cologne you would have laughed your head off it was in feed store near my hotel and i got there before the ﬁremen when they came at last in their tinpot hats they got out half dozen big squirts and rushed into the building with them then when it was out they put the squirts back into their little express wagon and drove off not line of hose run out not an engine pufﬁng not gong heard not
