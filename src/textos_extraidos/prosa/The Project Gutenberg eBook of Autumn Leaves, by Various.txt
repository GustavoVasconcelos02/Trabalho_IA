morning of last thursday christmas morning when nathan stoddard young saddler strode through the vacant streets of one of our new england towns hastening to begin his work the town is an one and although the observance of the ancient church festival is longer frowned upon in years past yet it has been little regarded especially in the church of which nathan is member the saddler mounted the steps of his shop he felt the blood so rush along his limbs and tingle in his ﬁngers that he could not forbear standing without the door moment if to enjoy the triumph of the warmth within him over the cold morning air the little stone church which nathan attends stands in the same square with his shop and nearly opposite it was closed usual on christmas day and recent snow had heaped the steps and roof and loaded the windows nathan thought that it looked uncommonly beautiful in the softening twilight of the morning while nathan stood musing with his eyes ﬁxed upon the church he became suddenly conscious that another ﬁgure had entered the square upon the opposite side and was walking hastily along he turned his eyes upon it and was greatly surprised by its appearance he saw tall old man although good deal stooping with long straight and very white hair falling over his shoulders which was the more conspicuous from the black velvet cap it appeared that he wore and the suit of pure black in which he was dressed and which seemed to nathan almost to glisten and ﬂash the old man tripped along he had hardly begun to speculate to who the stranger could be when he beheld him turn in between the posts by the path that leads to the church tread lightly over the snow and up the steps and knock hastily and vigorously at the but half recovered from his wonder he was just raising his voice to utter remonstrance when to his sevenfold amazement the door was opened to the knock and the old man disappeared the project gutenberg ebook of autumn leaves by various https was not without creeping feeling of awe mingled with his astonishment that nathan gazed upon the door through which this silent ﬁgure had vanished but he was not easily to be daunted he did not care to follow the steps of the stranger into the church but he remembered shed so placed against the building near the farther end that he had often when child at some peril indeed climbed upon its top and looked into the church through little window at one side of the pulpit this he started but he did not fail to run across the square and leap over the at the top of his speed in order to gather warmth and courage the attempt when nathan stoddard climbed upon the old shed and pressed his face against the glass of the little window he had at ﬁrst only confused impression of many lamps and many ﬁgures in all parts of the church but his vision grew more clear he beheld sight which could not amaze him less than the apparition that startled tam shanter he glared through the darkness into the old kirk of alloway the great chandelier of the church was partly lighted and there were besides many candles and lanterns burning in dif ferent parts of the room and casting their light upon lar ge party of young men and women who were dressed in breeches and rufﬂed shirts and hooped petticoats and towering such he had only seen in old pictures they were mounted upon benches and ladders and boards laid along the tops of the pews and were apparently just completing the decoration of the church which was already dressed with green with little trees in the corners and with green letters upon the walls and great wreaths about the pillars the whole party appeared full of life and cheerfulness while the old man whom nathan had seen enter stood near the door looking quietly on with little girl holding his hand it was not until nathan stoddard had looked some little time upon this spectacle that he began to feel that he was witness of any thing more than natural the whole party had so an air and appeared so engaged with their pleasant occupation that notwithstanding their quaint dress nathan only thought how much he should like to share their company but the more he studied their faces the more he was ﬁlled all their appearance of youth and their simple manners with strange sort of veneration the sweet and cheerful faces of the young women seemed to grow awfully calm and beautiful they brought their task to close and their foreheads with the hair brought back in the way to become more and more serene and high there was strange beauty too about the old man face he appeared to nathan if he felt that the group before him only waited his command to fade away in the morning light that struggled among the candles but he could not bear to give the word and so they kept playing with the festoons and stepping about the pews to please him nathan felt cold thrill partly from pleasure and partly from awe running up his back and strong pain across his forehead seldom known to one of his temperament again and again he drew his hand across his brows until he felt that he was near swooning and like to fall and he clung desperately to his hold when the ﬁt was over he dared venture more but hastened to the ground it was fear of ridicule or of incredulity that led nathan stoddard to keep secret what he had witnessed but it was like some deep and holy experience that would lose its charm if it were spoken of to another so he went back to his shop and sat looking upon the church and watching almost with dread the doves that lighted upon its roof and ﬂuttered about and beat their wings against its windows the minister of nathan parish was young man by the name of dudley and it so happened that he had driven out before light on the morning we have spoken of to visit sick man at some distance in returning home he had to pass along the rather unfrequented street which runs in the rear of his church and close to it he was driving rapidly along his ear caught what seemed the peal of an or gan he stopped his horse to listen and moment convinced him that the sound both of the instrument and of singing voices came from his own church and it was music of depth and beauty such he had never before heard within it filled with astonishment he put his horse upon its fastest trot and drove round into the square to the shop of nathan stoddard there is music in our church nathan he cried to the young saddler what can it mean but nathan answered not word he caught the horse by the head and fastened him to post before the door then stepping to the side of the sleigh he said to mr dudley come with sir mr dudley looked upon the pale face and trembling lips of his parishioner and followed in silence nathan sprang upon the shed at the side of the church and scrambled up to the little window dudley followed and with nathan help gained the same precarious foothold look in sir said nathan not venturing glance himself mr dudley looked and had not nathan arm been about his body

the dress and manners of our forefathers recognized the of century and half ago the singers gallery was ﬁlled by choir of girls and boys while his own place in the pulpit was occupied by ﬁgure whom he recognized the original of portrait which he had purchased and hung in his parlor at home its singular beauty it was said to be portrait of minister in the town who lived in the last century and is still remembered his virtues the sight of this old man face completely stilled the agitation of the young minister he was leaning over the great bible with his hands folded upon it and his eyes seemingly ﬁlled with tears of pleasure and gratitude and bent upon the choir dudley listened intently and could catch what seemed the words of some old christmas carol thou my cup of joy run and he was so rapt with the sights and the sounds within that it needed all nathan endeavors to uphold him by this time the sound of gathering crowd below which he had not heeded at ﬁrst was forced more and more upon his notice and the anxious voice of his oldest deacon calling mr dudley mr dudley rose high and loud while great thundering at the front door of the church announced that the people below had also caught the sound of the music and were clamorous admission mr dudley hastened round to prevent their causing any disturbance to the congregation within but he came only in time to see the door burst open and to be borne in with the crowd all gazed about in wonder the congregation indeed were gone and the preacher and the choir and the room was cold but there was great green cross over the pulpit and words along the walls and festoons upon the galleries and great wreaths like vast green serpents coiled about the cold pillars the church of the orthodox parish of had been fairly dressed christmas by spirit hands when mr dudley reached his home after the wonder had in part spent itself he found that an enormous christmas pie had been left at his door by old man dressed in black about six in the morning just after he had gone to visit his sick parishioner the girl who received it reported the old man saying in tremulous but very kind voice give your master the christmas blessing of an old puritan minister how the meaning of this message would have been known to mr dudley had not the events we have told disclosed it who can say need i add that my friend mr dudley from whose lips i have taken down the above narrative has directed the decorations to remain in his church during the coming month and that he avows the intention of observing the christmas of the following year with public services unless indeed he should be anticipated by his ancient predecessor it may not be impertinent to observe that i am invited to dine and spend the day with the dudleys

woody plants too were my delight though they invariably came out of the press they went in except that the leaves were in every variety of unnatural position i never grew weary either of gathering stately and graceful green ferns and ﬁnding them all cockled up the phrase went when i got home i believe i made some experiments on horsechestnut blossom once but it is not to be found in my herbarium i am inclined to think they were unsuccessful how happy children are with any new possession i thought there never was any thing quite equal to my new book all the girls had them with neat marbled covers and white paper within and each one was determined to make hers the best of the whole when pasting day came there was an intense excitement we all daubed our little ﬁngers to our heart content and our faces too to that i remember perfectly the sensation of smiling after the paste stiffened we spattered our desks and pasted the wrong side of the ﬂowers and stuck the leaves together and got every thing little and in short became so worried and heated and vexed that we did not hunt any more ﬂowers long time after the ﬁrst pasting day in the mean while my ideas had under gone

shrinking delicate wild ﬂowers that makes hesitate even to pick them from their shady retreats but then such was my ardor investigation the more i loved them and the more beautiful they seemed the more eagerly i tore them to fragments let the ingenious student analyze bits of brass wire and reduce to its simple elements much gunpowder he pleases but i raise my voice against this wanton destruction of rare and beautiful ﬂowers chemical process can ever restore them i glance over this new page i see merry troop of little girls crowding around their kind teacher trying to restrain their superabundant spirits and restless activity till they may give them free scope in the woods passing up the street they are joined by fresh recruits who come dancing out of the houses with baskets and trowels and tin boxes and delightfully mysterious suppers packed away nicely to be eaten in the most romantic place that can be found there is danger of snakes or ivy where they are going

the sport and making the air ring with their laughter i was sure afterwards to come upon the slippery places unintentionally and take slide whether i would or not i had i remember most unfortunate propensity climbing and scrambling choosing the worst paths and daring the others to follow my lead on precarious footholds it was unfortunate because i seldom came forth from these trials unscathed i was always tearing my dresses in clambering over fences or bumping my head in creeping under where others cleared brooks with light spring i landed in the middle i was sure to pick out spongy oozy slippery grass to stand upon in marshy land or was yet more likely to slump through over shoes in black mud banks always caved in beneath my feet unexpectedly brambles seemed to enter into conspiracy

the sun tempered in his ferocity by an occasional cloud above us the sea calm and all that sort of thing you what you want on such occasions we set sail from braman resolved to have jolly good time i ca describe our passage down it was altogether too full of fun to be written on one sheet sufﬁce it to say we laughed and sang and joked and ate and drank was when we were young and so on all the way and in fact i felt rather disappointed at arriving so soon we did at our destined port here new pleasures awaited us in the shape of acquaintances unexpected and unexpecting rides on the beach bowling and loaﬁng in general too rich to be described here and now but there is an end to all sport and ours came quite too soon the shadows had begun to lengthen considerably before we thought of starting on our return and certain ominous indications in the heavens above us warned us that our passage homewards was not by land further delay was unadvisable dolefully we set our sail and made boston harbor we began to feel the reaction which always follows season of extreme joviality and our spirits were down our chief wit tom who had before kept us the project gutenberg ebook of autumn leaves by

other joker second only to tom the above named having amused us during the whole day by long yarns spun out from varied experience and rich imagination betook himself to slumber and tried to dream that he was safe home again the rest of us performed our duties about the boat in gloomy silence looking occasionally with some anxiety at the clouds gathering slowly over our heads but keeping our opinions within our own breasts i had apprehension of danger nothing indicated gale in fact the breeze was gradually deserting us all that was to be feared was calm steady rain which visiting us at distance of several miles from home and late at night promised any thing but an agreeable conclusion to our day excursion at last it came first heavy drop then few more and then regular straight pour our sail hung motionless and we seemed to stand still and take it our companions were soon roused from their abstraction by the very unpleasant circumstances and we hastily took counsel together unship the mast says tom and over with your oars we obeyed our captain sulkily and soon were moving on again we pulled away an hour or so drenched with the rain which seemed to come down faster than ever and were about miserable and pack of wretches ever lived there is nothing like good ducking to use the common expression to take the life and spirit out of man not to mention the other discomforts that attended our situation silently we rowed and not sound was heard above the plashing of the rain upon the surface of the sea and the regular stroke of the oars it very strange that we

position there we were high and dry on bank of mud scooped furrow on each side of us attesting the frantic ef forts of our oarsmen to get headway and long wake ten feet in extent marking our distance from the sea behind us such was our position the moon revealed it to us we looked dolefully in one another faces three minutes then grim smile gradually stole over tom expressive countenance he slowly ejaculated point shirley it is when the ludicrous side of the matter seemed to occur to each of us simultaneously and we indulged ourselves with roar of laughter ﬁrst since we had left nahant of course nothing could be done under the circumstances but we must wait patiently the rising of the tide to ﬂoat us of so we sat there in our wet garments until the dead of night when our boat gradually

way that i need not see her from my window i put the bars up again and lay in wait behind the bushes soon i heard her approaching i come forward she comes near on that pony of hers who holds his head

talking nonsense with little handsome i hear her amusing my good aunty and i catch few words her utterance having peculiar distinctness and the lowest tones being ﬁne and clear like those of good singer on pianissimo strain it is peculiarly ladylike articulation was she born and bred in ratborough i wonder she never speaks while we are singing does she like music then i asked her once but what sort of answer is y es to such question and that is all i elicited music again the forenoon occupation miss flora does not like being criticized i ﬁnd one must not presume to set her right in the smallest particular singers are proverbially irritable i am not certain i could belong to and never get cross or unreasonable i hate to be corrected but i hate more to be incorrect i could give canary

day to test her power over she made dance with her and now i feel like fool i think of etty playing waltz us at flora request and giving long serious look i approached the piano to compliment her playing i could not utter word i answered her gaze with one sober and more sad and came away to my room to have some talk with my real self now it says i to myself truce to your upbraidings you old

thoughts well from hurry and uncertainty of mind which i am not often troubled withal it was partly astonishment in truth that confused little ugly and i actually exchanging ideas i shall call her little ugly still however i could not make her look at she spoke nor answer my wit by change of countenance 28th little handsome can not be convinced that the ﬂirtation is over at an end she alternately rails at my capricious solemnity and pretends to be grieved at it i can see that nothing but my avoidance of is my safety should the sentimental tone prevail and tears come into those beautiful eyes i am gone man at my earnest request i have grown humble or bold enough to ask favor miss etty has brought or rather dragged her into the parlor great basket it is so great that i imagine in her own apartment she gets into the middle of it bodily i sat down to watch the motions of her adroit little digits in darning stockings and mending homely garments i imagined rather than saw humorous gleam in her eye i did so and there was certainly slight contraction of her mouth in length if to counteract an inclination of the muscles to move in the opposite direction flora ﬂuttered about the room like butterﬂy pausing moment at window or bookcase or resting awhile to play few capricious notes on the piano and sometimes coming to view miss etty employment if it were branch of industry she was unacquainted with and curious about the maples are turning red already the setting sun threw glorious light through their tinted foliage and the still bosom of the lake reﬂected it in softened changeable hue of mingled crimson and silver flora was standing at the door i somehow found myself there also but i talked over my shoulder to aunt tabitha about potatoes i have fancy walk round the pond said flora after pause she looked at much to say you see you monster it is too late to go alone miss flora i will second your wish if you can drum up third party said i flora blushed and pouted moment then beckoned to little ugly who disobligingly suggested that the grass would be wet it so happened there was dew and flora convinced her of the fact by running in the grass and then presenting the sole of her shoe her inspection miss etty her objection being vanquished went her bonnet and we set forth miss flora arm in mine matter of course and miss etty in hers save where the exigencies of the woodland path gave her an excuse to drop behind little the project gutenberg ebook of autumn leaves by various https to stump suggested to flora new whim instead of going round the pond which i now began to like doing i must weary myself with rowing her across i was ready enough to it however had not miss etty quietly observed that the pond was muddy and the boat unseaworthy flora would not have yielded to twenty feet of water mud she sighed and resumed my arm i of fering the other to miss etty in so determined way that she could not waive accepting it marched forward with spirits rising into high glee and loquacity presently feeling sudden irritation at the feather lightness with which little ugly ﬁngers just touched my elbow if she disdained any support from i caught her hand and drew it through my arm and when i relinquished it pressed her arm to my side with mine thinking she would snatch it away and walk alone in offended dignity whether she was too really digniﬁed that or took my rebuke it was intended i know not but she leaned on my arm with somewhat greater conﬁdence during the remainder of our walk and now and then even volunteered remark before we ﬁnished the circumambulation of the pond she had quite forgotten her sulky reserve and talked with much earnestness and animation flora subsiding into listener with willing interest which raised her in my estimation considerably and now that i am alone in my room and journalizing it behooves to gather up and record some of those words precious from their rarity flora and i in our merry nonsense had mock dispute and referred the matter to miss etty arbitration etty mind you side with said flora be an impartial umpire miss etty said i and you will be on my side little ugly was obliged to confess that she had not heard word of the matter her thoughts being elsewhere intently engaged i must request you to excuse my inattention she said and to repeat what you were saying the latter request i scorn to grant said i and the former we will consider about when we have heard what thoughts have been preferred to our most edifying conversation you shall tell us said flora y es or we till go of f and leave you to your meditations here in the dark woods with the owls and the whom you probably prefer company miss etty condescended to confess she should be frightened without my manful triumph i must thank you she said the novelty of an evening walk in the woods i enjoy it i confess very highly look at those dark mysterious vistas and those deepening shadows blending the bank with its mirror how dif ferent from the trite daylight truth it took strong hold of my imagination go on and so you were i was hardly doing so much thinking i was seeing it to remember etty draws like an artist said flora in whisper i was taking mental daguerreotype of my companions by twilight and of all the scene round too in the same grey tint just to look at some ten or ﬁfteen years hence let us all three agree said i on the 28th of september to remember this evening i am certain i shall look back to it with pleasure horrid shrieked flora how can you talk so by that time you will be shocking sort of person i always wonder how people can be resigned to live when they have lost youth and with it all that makes life bearable fifteen years dismal thought i shall have outlived every thing i care about in life so moaned little handsome but you may have found new sources of interest suggested i perhaps little too tenderly i had some sympathy with her dread of that particular phase of existence perhaps the mistress of the project gutenberg ebook of autumn leaves by various https worse and worse screamed flora miserable comforter you are if it were not enough merely to grow old but one must be slave and martyr never doing any thing one would prefer to nor going anywhere that one wants to go ever to one spot and one perpetual planning dinners every day cooks hardly less ignorant than yourself added i laughing at her selﬁsh horror of matronly bondage yet provoked at it miss etty would you if you could stand still instead of going forward my happiness is altogether dif ferent from flora she replied though we were brought up side by side what has taught to be independent of the world and its notice was my being continually compared with her and assured with compassionate regret that i had none of those qualiﬁcations which could give success in general society which was i began without the last syllable said flora catching up the word at any rate i knew i was plain and shy and made friends slowly so i chose such pleasures should be under my own control and could never fail they make my life so much happier and more precious than it was ten years ago that i feel certain i shall have wider and fuller enjoyment of the same ten years hence what they are i partly guess and partly drew from her in her uncommonly frank mood i begin to perceive that i well flora have been cherishing most mistaken and unsatisfactory aims my surly old inner self has often hinted much but i would not hear him etty may have her mistaken views too but she has set thinking well you crusty old curmudgeon what has been my course since the awe of the schoolmaster ceased to be sort of external conscience you told study was none of my business says conscience and pretty piece of work you have made of it without idle in college and when you began to perceive the connection between study and what people call success in life overworking yourself here you are and just beginning to bethink yourself that i might have furnished just the right degree of stimulus if you had but allowed it hark hark it is the duet that silvery second is etty i will steal down stairs and when they have ended pop in and it shall go hard but i will have another song parlor dark and empty i fancied i heard flora giggling somewhere but i might be mistaken yet the voices sounded if they came from that i am sure i heard one note on the piano to give the pitch hark i hear the parlor door softly shut and now the stairs creak and betray them stealing up they probably betrayed stealing down they only blew out the lights and kept perfectly itches donkey etty your voice is still with clear sweet and penetrating it was when you talked so eloquently night in our dreamy what if i had early adopted her idea that with every conscious power is bound up both the duty and the pleasure of developing it might i not now have reached higher ground with health of body and mind ambition is an unhealthy stimulus wretchedly uneasy guest too in the breast of an invalid i would fain have purer motive which shall dismiss or control it etty are the uses to be made of her talents while she lives thus withdrawn into world of her own certainly she is wrong i shall convince her of it when our friendship now fairly planted i trust shall have taken root now we shall be the best friends in the world and i will conﬁde to her i am nodding over my paper and that click says the old clock at the stair is making ready to announce midnight 29th capricious are the ways of womankind little ugly is more thoroughly and undemonstrative than ever i am chagrined think i am an man i am downright angry and have half mind to ﬂirt with little handsome out of spite only miss etty is too indif ferent to care i did but leave my old aunt to flora and step back to remark that it was pleasant sunday that the sermon the project gutenberg ebook of autumn leaves by various https and dull and that the singing was discordant miss etty assented but very coldly and presently she bolted into an old red house and left to go home by myself when we started church again she was among the missing and we found her in the pew on our arrival thus pointedly to avoid might be accident however she did not refuse to sing from the same with and pointed to verse on the other page quaint but excellent after all old watts has written the best hymns in the language evening without choice i found myself walking round the pond again it was smooth glass and the leaves scarcely trembled on the trees and bushes round it and in my heart reigned similar calm strange quiet has fallen on my usually restless and anxious mind i thought that in future i could be content not to look beyond the present duty and having done my best in all circumstances that i could leave the results to follow god wills at that moment i could sincerely say let him set high or low wherever he has work to perform if i can remain thus quiet in mind my health will soon return i feel assured if distrust i fear this peace must be only mood to pass away when my natural spirits return the fever of covetousness of rivalry of envy and ambitious earthly aspirations will come back like waves upon the lake these uneasy feelings will chase each other over my soul i picked up little linen wristband at this moment which i recognized she does not deserve to have it again sulky little ugly said i i will put it in my and keep it remembrancer am glad to is the very spot where we stood when we agreed to remember it and each other ﬁfteen years hence we will see what i shall be then and i shall have some aid from this funny little talisman it will speak to quite intelligibly and distinctly its owner in silent mood at any rate how lonely i feel every human soul hermit yet there might be something nearer companionship than i have found mine yet one knows my real old fellow i like you better than i did let us be good friends 30th golden sunrise how much one loses under false idea of its being luxury to sleep in the morning reclining under farmer puddingstone elm and looking upon the glassy pond in which the glowing sky mirrored itself my soul was ﬁred with poetic inspiration on the blank page of letter i wrote how holy the calm in the stillness of morn and threw down my paper being suddenly quenched by i was debating whether to write t ethelind over the top returning that way after my ramble i found the following conclusion pinned to the tree by jackknife how holy the calm in the stillness of morn when to call to breakfast josh toots on the horn the ducks gives quack and the caow gives moo and the childen chimes in with their plaintive how holy the calm in the stillness of neune when the pot is singin its silvery teune its soft woolly teune jest like aribi darter while the plays up the simperny arter how holy the calm in the stillness of night when the moon like punkin looks yaller and bright while the aowls an the katydids screeching like time jest brings up close to the eend my rhyme and underneath was added if in scorn of my fruitless endeavor i wrote that are right of f fast you could shell corn i suppose it is by way of thanks my having driven the pigs from the garden that i ﬁnd great bunch of dahlias adorning my mantelpiece brown earthen pitcher and in the middle of the dahlias magniﬁcent sunﬂower it must be my aunt doing and its very homeliness pleases just i love her homely sincerity of affection who arranges the glasses in the parlor etty i would not fear to afﬁrm from the asters the project gutenberg ebook of autumn leaves by various https cheek by jole with petunias and carnations i wonder if she would not like some of the clematis i saw twining about dead tree by the pond it is more beautiful in its present state than when it was in ﬂower etty loves wild ﬂowers because she is one herself and loves to hide here in her native nook where eye i might except my own gives her more than casual noon i shall think it quite uncivil of little ugly if she does not volunteer to arrange my share of the booty i am bringing now that i have almost broken my neck and quite my cane to obtain it this i said to myself i came into the house by the kitchen entrance and proceeded to deposit my trailing treasures on norah table by the side of yellow squash go with to captain black said etty voice at the side door the old folks have not seen you since your return i ca said flora with drawl yes be coaxable once it only makes obstinate to coax why not go without i beg i am novelty i was in twice only yesterday old people like attention from such you because it is unreasonable to expect it the old man is failing i ca him any good it is dusty and my gown is long it would please him to see you i went to sit with him yesterday but timothy digfort came in with the same intent so i went to church having walked in the graveyard till the bell rang owl that you are i envy you the lively meditations you must have had why you go it of use waiting what will you let carry both these baskets there put the little one on the top of the other i think three or four peaches and few ﬂowers can add much to the weight it is tiresome enough to what i want to when it is really necessary and little handsome danced into the parlor without perceiving i laid detaining hand on etty basket she put herself in motion on which she turned round with look of unfeigned astonishment may i not be substitute flora i inquired i not require any aid said miss etty shyly it is not on that account i was ur ging flora please to let have the it is quite unnecessary you should trouble yourself she insisted i persevered in carrying of f my load it is the old red house is it not said i with the roof sloping almost to the ground and shall i say that you sent this view of my strange phiz will not refresh the old people like the sight of flora fresh young face but i shall go in and make the agreeable well i can are you really in earnest asked etty looking full in my face with smile of wonder that made her radiantly beautiful she turned away blushing at my surprised and eager gaze and taking up her little basket joined without word of answer on my part it was some time before i quite recovered from strange ﬂurry of spirits which made my heart bump very much it does when i hear any unexpected good news and then i dashed away upon the subject of old age and any thing else that came uppermost in the hope of drawing the eyes to mine again with that transﬁguring smile playing upon the lips but i was like an unskilful magician i had lost the spell i could not again discover the spring i had touched in vain i said to myself i make her it again little ugly the project gutenberg ebook of autumn leaves by various https answered my incoherent sallies in her usual sedate manner and i believe it was only in my imagination that her cheek dimpled little with heightened color now and then when i was particularly eloquent introduced by miss etty i was cordially welcomed i am always af fected by the sight of an aged woman who at all reminds of the grandmother so indulgent to my prankful boyhood the old man too interested he has seen much of the world in his seafaring life and related his adventures in most unhackneyed style i go and see them every day one of the captain anecdotes was very good an old salt he said bah what was it how very lovely etty looked sitting on cricket at the old woman feet and with half smile on her face submitting her polished little head to be stroked by her trembling hands this i saw out of the corner of my eye hark aunt tabitha call to dinner i am glad of it i was scribbling such nonsense when i have so much to write better worth while 12 the night is beautiful and it is piece of to close the shutter light my lamp and write in my journal peace of mind came yesterday positive happiness neither of which i can analyze i only know i have not been so thoroughly content since the acquisition of my ﬁrst jackknife nor so proud since the day when i ﬁrst sported shining beaver i have conquered etty distrust she has actually promised her friendship i am rather surprised that i am so enchanted at this triumph over prejudice i am hugely delighted not because it is triumph however has nothing to with it it is worthier feeling one in which humility mingles with more cordial than i have hitherto been conscious of i can and i will deserve etty good opinion she is an uncompromising judge but i will surprise her by going beyond what she believes capable of i never had sister i shall adopt etty and when i go home we will write every week if not every day but how came it all about by what blessed sunbeams can the ice have been softened till now i hope it is broken up ever people under the same roof can not long mistake each other it seems else etty and i should never have become friends we left the door of captain black house and turned into the ﬁeld path to avoid the dust etty said i not know whether you care much about it but you have given pleasure to these good old people who have but little variety in their daily routine being poor and inﬁrm and lonely it is really duty to cheer them up if we can i felt that it warmed my heart to have shared that duty with her and i said so i thought she looked doubtful and surprised it was good opening egotism and i improved it i saw that she was uninterested listener but all along rather suspicious and incredulous if what i was claiming myself was inconsistent with her previous notions of my disposition i believe i had made some little impression saturday night but her old distrust had come back by sunday morning now she was again shaken at last looking up with the air of one who has taken mighty resolve she said i presume such keen observer yourself must have noticed that the most reserved people are on some occasions the most frank and direct i am going to tell you that i feel some apology due to you if my ﬁrst impressions of your character are really incorrect i am puzzled what to think i am to suppose that your ﬁrst impressions were not favorable those of black whom i heard remark that i was an amiable youth with an uncommonly pleasant smile just the opposite in fact to my eye you had mocking ironical cast of countenance i felt sure at once you were the sort of person i never could make friend of and acquaintances i leave to flora who wants to know every body i thought the less i had to with you the better i felt hurt and almost insulted i had not been mistaken then she had disliked and perhaps disliked yet it was not that i stood in fear of your satire she continued i am indif ferent to ridicule or censure in general one but friend has power to wound ﬂattering emphasis truly i felt my temper little stirred by miss etty frankness i was sulkily the project gutenberg ebook of autumn leaves by various https i had claim to any forbearance any consideration peculiarities of any sort i am perfectly resigned to being the theme of your wit in any circle if you can ﬁnd aught in my ways to amuse you zounds i must speak my conduct to flora must have conﬁrmed the charming impression produced by my unlucky phiz i imagine but bear malice against in her behalf you must have seen that she was perfectly able to revenge herself etty laugh rung out and reminded of my once bafﬂed curiosity when it reached my ear from norah domain but though this unsuppressed mirth of hers revealed the prettiest row of teeth in the world and made the whole face decidedly beautiful somehow or other it gave pleasure but rather feeling of depression my joining in it was pure pretence presently the brightness faded and i found myself gazing at the cold countenance of little ugly again i did not refer to flora said she you say she can avenge her own quarrel and we both were quite ready to laugh at you you could be to laugh at us i assure you doubt of it said i with some pique but what i can not give you can not think of with any toleration what cried i astonished how have i of fended man of any right feeling at all could not make game of an aged woman his own relative at the same time that he was receiving her hearty and af fectionate hospitality neither have i done so cried i in towering passion y great wrong in accusing of it i would knock any man down who should treat my aunt with any disrespect and if i have sometimes allowed flora to it unrebuked you well know that she might once have pulled my hair or cuf fed my ears and i should have thought it becoming thing young lady to i have played the fool under your eye and submit that you should entertain high opinion of my wisdom but you have right to judge so unfavorably of my heart if i have spoken to my aunt with boyish petulance when she vexed at least it was to her face and regretted and atoned to her satisfaction i am incapable of deceiving her much less of ridiculing her either behind her back or before her face i respond to her love with sincere gratitude and the sister of my grandmother shall never want any attention that an own grandson could render while i live i shall ﬁnd it hard to give you this accusation miss etty i said haughtily and shut my mouth if i would never speak to her again she made answer but looked up into my face with one of those wondrous smiles it went straight to my heart pistol bullet could my high indignation proving defence against it i was instantly vanquished and i heartily shook the hand she held out to i was just able to refrain from pressing it to my lips which now i think of it would have been most absurd thing to i wonder what could have made think of doing it after dinner i hear flora musical laugh in the mysterious boudoir and low congratulatory little murmur of good humor on etty part i believe she is afraid to laugh loud lest i should hear her it and rush to the spot the door is ajar i storm the castle flora admitted with shout of welcome the instant i tapped etty pushed toward but said nothing the little room was almost lined with books drawings paintings shells corals and in the sunny window plants met my exploring gaze but the great basket was nowhere to be seen it was got up the nonce i imagine etty rogue this is the pleasantest nook in the house it is shame you have not been let in before said flora zealously you shall see etty drawings neither of us opened the portfolio she seized however but watched etty eyes they were cast down with difﬁdent blush which gave pain i was indeed an intruder she gave us the permission we waited however there were many good copies of lessons the project gutenberg ebook of autumn leaves by various https did not dwell upon but the sketches spirited though imperfect i studied if they had been those of an allston etty was evidently in ﬁdget at this preference of the smallest line of original talent over the corrected performances which are like those of every body else i drew out ﬁgure done in black chalk on brown paper it chained flora wondering attention quite new it was young man with his chair tipped back his feet rested on table with slipper perched on each toe his hands were clasped upon the back of his head the i was angry at the diabolical expression given it by eyes looking askance and lips pressed into an arch by contemptuous smile it was corner of this very brown sheet that i saw under her arm when she vanished from the kitchen i entered the vociferous mirth which attracted was at my expense before flora could recognize my portrait little ugly pounced upon it it fell in crumpled lump into the bright little wood ﬁre and ceased to exist i had totally gotten it said she with blush which avenged my wounded ironical pleasure at having been the subject of her pencil i could not indulge myself in expressing i did not care to enlighten little handsome any lurking pique was banished when etty showed with smile the twilight view by the pond you draw she asked and flora cried he makes caricatures of his friends with pen and ink let him deny it if he can i
