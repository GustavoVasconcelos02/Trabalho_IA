delicate soft south wind barely touched the leaves of the big trees among whose branches the busy green parrots had been chattering and the gorgeous peacocks screeching and swinging all through the

in bold relief against the brilliant sunset an elderly gentleman with grizzled hair and beard careworn expression and mild brown eyes that were anxiously riveted on the at present sailless sea he carried small red telescope in his hand and divided his time between pacing the short grass plateau and spasmodically sweeping the horizon what was he looking so impatiently he was looking the smoke of the calcutta steamer that brought mails and passengers to port blair once in every six weeks think of but one mail in six weeks ye sybarites of pall mall revelling in dozen daily posts scores of papers and all the latest telegrams from china to peru imagine reading up forty days arrears of your times or post imagine six punches simultaneously gladly colonel denis usually hailed his letters and especially the weekly gazette yet it was neither news nor promotion that he was so restlessly awaiting thoughts were altogether centred on passenger his only daughter whom he had not seen thirteen years not since she was little mite in socks and sashes and now she was ﬁnished young lady coming out from england by this mail to be the mistress of his house he was glad that this long anticipated day had dawned at last and yet he scarcely dared to analyze his own feelings was ashamed to own even in his inmost heart that mingled with all his felicity there is secret kind of stiﬂed misgiving this girl who is to share his home within the next few hours is in reality far personal acquaintance goes much stranger to him if he had never seen her before although she is his own little nell with whom he used to romp by the hour in the verandah at karkipore thirteen years ago those thirteen years stand between him and that familiar merry face dancing gait and ﬂoating yellow hair they have taken that away and what are they going to give him instead of course he and his daughter had corresponded by every mail but what are nice affectionate letters what are presents yea photographs when the individuality of the giver has long been blurred and indistinct when the memory of face and the sound of voice have faded and faded till nothing tangible remains but name children of ﬁve years old have but short memories and in helen denis case there was one near her to revive her dying recollections i wonder if she will know among the crowd her father muttered he paced the platform with the telescope behind his back i sorry now i never had my photo taken to prepare her how strange i shall feel with girl in the house after all these years i quite forgotten woman ways from an expression that came into his eyes one might gather that backward glance at woman ways was not altogether one of the most agreeable memories of the past if she should be and he paused shuddered and looked out over the sea some minutes with face that had grown suddenly stern his thoughts were abruptly recalled to the present by the sound of footsteps coming up the gravel pathway behind him hullo colonel cried loud cheery voice why are you doing sentry here oh of course i get you expect miss denis this mail yes i looking out the steamer he replied he turned round and accosted very handsome young man with aquiline features brilliant teeth and eyes blue the surrounding sea tall young man carefully dressed in creaseless light suit who wore pale silk tie run through ring gloves and carried large white umbrella he had an adequate appreciation of his own appea rance and with good reason men frequently referred to him the fellow of their acquaintance and women spoiled him they had petted him and

people down to the present time when he although you would not think it had passed his birthday he had been sent to port blair in connection with some new works on the mainland and was acting another man who had gone on furlough his name was known beauty apollo or look and die and he was really less conceited than might have been expected under the circumstances quentin was not alone his compan ion was shorter slighter and altogether more insigniﬁcant person dark an arab through exposure to the sun he wore weather terai pulled so far over his brows that one could only guess at pair of piercing eyes thin visage and black moustache his clothes were by means new his hands burnt to rich maho gany and innocent of gloves ring or umbrella somehow with his slouched hat slender ﬁgure and swarthy skin he had rather foreign air and was complete contrast to his patron look and die quentin whom he followed slowly up the hill and muttering an indistinct greeting to colonel denis he walked on few paces and stood with his arms folded looking down upon the sea somewhat in the attitude of the picture of napoleon at helena this sunburnt silent individual was known by the name of the photographer he was mysterious stranger who three months previously had dropped into the not into if from the clouds and during these three months the united ingenuity of the community had failed to discover anything more about him than what they had learned the very ﬁrst day he had landed on ross to wit that his name was lisle and that he had come from calcutta to take photographs among the islands immediately after his arrival he had established himself in the dâk bungalow on aberdeen had hired boat and in very short time had made himself completely at home his belongings consisted of small quantity of luggage large camera some and native servant who refused to elucidate any one on the subject of his master and the public were very inquisitive about that gentleman who shall say that their curiosity was not legitimate people never came to ross unless they were convicts settlement ofﬁcers formed part of the garrison or were functionaries like quentin who was acting some one else lisle did not come under any of these heads he was not an ofﬁcer hindoo or otherwise he did not belong to the settlement nor was he one of the class whose special behoof the islands had been colonized the problem still remained unsolved who was lisle what was he doing at port blair where did he come from when and where was he going was he rich or poor married or single all these queries still remained unsolved and opened up ﬁne ﬁeld of speculation society so isolated from the outer world so meagrely supplied with legitimate news were naturally thrown good deal upon their own resources topics of conversation and discussion week after most of the papers had been read and digested and people had to fall back upon little items of local and such items were wont to be scarce think then what godsend conjecture and discussion lisle would and did prove this waif blown to them from beyond the sea without address or reference if he had been uneducated person it would have been totally different but the aggravating thing was that shabby were his clothes he had the unmistakable bearing and address of gentleman he spent all his days photographing natives trees islands if his daily bread solely depended on his industry he lived not far from where quentin dwelt in splendid bungalow in solitary state and the former constantly meeting the photographer had scraped up an acquaintance with him had dropped in and smoked friendly cigarettes in the rest house verandah had thrown out feelers in in vain come to the conclusion that lisle was very gentlemanly fellow in his way he was fool that he was most entertaining companion and wound up by insisting that he should come and share his roof to this lisle objected in fact he refused the invitation but when he learned that the rest bungalow was requisitione d some missionaries and when his host became the more pressing the more he was reluctant he gave in after considerable hesitation pg 6 pg 7 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https you see it not purely unselﬁsh idea said quentin i awfully lonely at this soul to speak to unless i go to ross and i often too lazy to stir and now i shall have you to argue with and to keep company of an evening then to your photographs there lots of room them you can have whole side of the house to yourself and you please i come on one condition replied the other looking straight at him i come if you will allow to pay my share of the butler account and all that sort of thing we are speaking quite require some one to talk to i want roof since you say the missionaries are coming to the rest house i doubt if we would assimilate quentin who had been lounging in low cane chair took his cigar out of his mouth blew cloud of smoke and hesitated it was all very well to have this chap up to keep him company of an evening but to chum with jove the other seemed to read what was passing through his mind he said with twinkle in his eye i not fellow travelling ﬁrm of photographers doubt every one imagines i an envelope over to his that my name quentin took up the paper carelessly cast his eye over it became rather red and laughed nervously from this time forwa rd lisle and quentin chummed together on equal terms to the scandal of their neighbours who were amazed that such fastidious man look and die quentin should open his house and his arms to this unknown shabby stranger his manners were studiously courteous and polite but he understood how to entrench himself in fortress of reserve that held even creery the chief lady of port blair at bay and this was saying very hard two damaging statements had been it were wrested from him he liked the andamans because there was daily post and telegrams and he had occupation now did not admission number one savour of dread of blue envel opes and clamouring hungry whom he had effectually given the slip and admission number two was worse still occupation now was doubtless the result of social and ﬁnancial bankruptcy creery was disposed to deal hardly with her opinion he was an outlaw she rather prided herself upon having ﬁtted him neatly with name if he had thrown her one sop of conciliation or given her the least little hint about himself and his affairs she might have tolerated him but he remained perversely dumb quentin was dumb it was shrewdly suspected that he knew more about his inmate than any indeed he had gone so far to deny that he was professional photographer when rigidly by certain lady he only laughed and shook his head and said that lisle was harmless mad on the subject of photography and but otherwise pleasant companion but beyond this he declined to enlighten his questioner assistance being forthcoming society was obliged to classify the stranger themselves and they ticketed him genteel loafer penniless who had come down to port blair in hopes vain of obtaining some kind of employment and had now comfortably established himself mr quentin hanger and unpaid companion it must be admitted that the stranger gave considerable colour to this view he did not visit and mix with society on ross he wore shabby clothes and shocking hats and spent most of his time tramping the bush with gun on his shoulder or camera on his back looking all the world like an italia n or brigand according to that high authority creery three months he had been without competitor in the interest of the community but now his day was over his star on the wane he was about to give place to very rare and important new arrival namely an unmarried lady who was currently reported to be but eighteen years of age and very pretty pg 8 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https ii expectation now sits expectation in the air and hides sword all this time colonel denis had been engaged in animated conversation with quentin nature had been doubly genero us to the latter gentleman she had not merely endowed him with unusual personal attractions but had increased these attractions by the gift of charming manner that fascinated every one who came in contact with the general himself down to the sullen convict boatmen it was quite natural to him even when discussing trivial subject with an individual who rather bored him than otherwise to throw such an appearanc of interest into his words and looks that one would imagine all his thoughts were centred in the person before him and the topic under discussion to men this attitude was ﬂattering to women irresistible and what though his words were writ on sand his manner had its effect and was an even more powerful factor in his great popularity than his stalwart ﬁgure and handsome face at the present moment he stood leaning on his furled umbrella listening with rapt attention to what colonel denis had to say on the subject of versus gigs every one at ross kept boat of their own like the at the time of the flood the colonel was enlar ging on the capabilities of his new expressly in honour of his daught er he would have bought carriage elsewher he was interrupted by lisle who meanwhile had been keeping watch on the horizon and whistling snatches of the overture to mirella under his breath abruptly announcing here she is colonel denis was so startled that he actually dropped the telescope which rolled to his informant feet who picking it up noticed he returned it that colonel denis was looking strangely nervous and that the hand stretched towards him was shaking visibly he gazed at him with considerable surprise and was about to make some remark when quentin exclaimed in tone of genuine alarm by geor ge here is creery i see the top of her topee coming up the hill and i going but he reckoned without that good lady who had already cut off his retreat in another moment her round ﬂorid face appeared below the topee followed by her ample person clad in sulphur sateen costume garnished with green ribbons last but not least came her fat dog nip an animal that she called darling treasure duck and but other person in the settlement recognized him by any of these titles before she was within twenty yards she called out in thin authoritative treble well what are you all doing here what is it eh any news you need not be looking the scotia she ca possibly be in till you told you so colonel denis oh in answer to silent gesture from lisle so she is coming in is she in tone that gave her listeners to understand that she had business to be there contradicting creery and so you have been up playing tennis at the general to quentin i saw your peon going by with your bat and shoes but what has brought you over to ross lisle thought you rarely left the mainland fastening on him now that especial reason i often come over he replied parrying the question you been shopping in the bazaar she continued you have been buying collars pg 9 pg 10 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https creery is is gifted with sight all the same it was not collars but cartridges that he had purchased not she returned the lady with laugh but she has eyes in her head and that collar in your hand i can tell most things by the shape of the parcel still charmed ever with aberdeen lisle bowed i heard that you were going away so i he paused and then added some day what you with all your them oh but to be sure you ca that here you must ﬁnd the chemicals terribly costly they are rather expensive i tell you what i will give you little commission how would you like to come over some morning and take and nip and then the bungalow and then group of our servants if lisle face was any index of his mind it said plainly that he would not relish the prospect at all i want to send home some photos to my sister lady grubb of course i shall pay that understood during this conversation colonel denis looked miserably uncomfortable and quentin if it was with painful difﬁculty that he restrained his laughter the travelling photographer alone was unmoved he surveyed his patroness gravely if he were taking mental plate of her topee with its purple puggaree her little eager light eyes her important nose and ruddy cheeks and then replied in most deferential manner thank you very much your kind of fer but i am not professional photographer was creery crushed not at all she merely raised her light eyebrows and said oh not professional photographer then what are you creery very humble slave bowing profoundly photographs are rather sore subject with him just now broke in quentin in his loud hearty voice you have not heard what happened to him yesterday when he was out shooting how should i she retorted peevishly well i must say he bore it like stoic i myself mild i am and sweet you know my temper to be would have killed the fellow what fellow my new chokra time hung heavily on his hands and i suppose he thought he would be doing something really useful once in his life so he went into the room where lisle keeps all his precious plates not even printed he has collected and treasured like so many well well well tapping her foot my dear lady i coming to it if you wo hurry my confounded chokra took them all so much dirty glass and washed every man jack of them and was exceedingly proud of his industry and what did you to him demand ed creery turning round and staring at the victim of ignorance could i he knew better but i told my fellow not to let him come near few days pg 11 pg 12 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https colonel denis said the lady now addressing him is it true that you have not seen your daughter thirteen years yes quite true i am sorry to say why did you not go home on furlough i never could manage it when i could get home i had money and when money was plentiful there was leave ah and you told she was pretty girl i believe i hope you are not building on that pretty children are delusion i never yet saw one of them that did not grow up plain excepting creery expostulated quentin if history is to be believed i was most beautiful beautiful that people came to see miles and miles around and insinuatingly i sure you would not call plain now creery who had secret partiality this gentleman laughed incredulously and then replied well perhaps you are the exception that proves the rule of course once more addressing colonel denis your daughter will bring out all the new fashions and have end of pretty is if you have given her liberal outﬁt she here paused reply but answer being forthcoming went on if you feel at all nervous about meeting her i go on board with you with pleasure i should like it and you are well enough acquainted with to know that you have only to say the word at this suggestion the eyes of the two bystanders met and exchanged signiﬁcant glance and whilst colonel denis was stammering forth his thanks and excuses they hastily took leave of creery and made their escape the steamer is coming in very fast and i think i go home and see that everything is ready said the colonel after pause well perhaps it would be well acceded the lady but are you really certain you would not like to meet her or at any rate to be at your bungalow to receive her once more her companion politely but ﬁrmly declined her good ofﬁces assuring her earnestly that they were quite unnecessa ry and the lady visibly disappointed said she shouldered her parasol and turned away perhaps you will have your journey nothing i should not be the least surpri sed if she did not come by this steamer after all and mark my words that you would engage in spite of my advice will give you trouble yet colonel denis nothing daunted hurried down to his own bungalow large one facing the mainland entirely surrounded by deep verandah and approached by pathway hedged with yellow heliotrope good many preparations had been made the expected young mistress there were ﬂowers everywhere in profusion curious tropical ones berries and orchids and ferns the lamps were lit in the and everything was extremely neat and yet there was want there was bare gaunt look about the although it had been lately furnished and ram sawmy the butler of twenty years standing had disposed the chairs and tables in the most approved his put up coloured purdahs and white curtains all missy baba nevertheless the general effect was grim and comfortless there were books or chair there certainly were few coarse white antimacassars but these were gracefully arranged according to sawmy taste coverings the smaller tables colonel denis looked about him discontentedly moved chair here vase there then happening to catch glimpse of himself in mirror he went up to it and anxiously confronted his own reﬂect ion how wrinkled and grey he looked he might be ﬁfteen years older than his real age after few seconds he took up and opened small album and critically scanned faded photograph of gentleman in long with corresponding whiskers leaning pg 13 pg 14 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https balustrade his hat and gloves carelessly disposed at his portrait of himself taken many years previously there is use in my thinking that it the least like now she could not know more than i would know then closing the book with snap and suddenly raising his voice he called out here sawmy see that dinner is ready in half an hour and have the ayah waiting i going missy doubtless dinner and the ayah had long time to wait it was fully an hour before the scotia dropped anchor off ross she was immediately surrounded by swarm of boats including that of colonel denis who boarded her and descended among the crowd to the cabin with his heart beating unusually fast the cabin lamps were lit and somewhat dazzled the eyes of those who entered from the moonlight there were but few passengers and the most noticeable of these was helen denis who sat alone at the end of narrow table with bag on her lap the inevitable waterproof over her arm and her gaze ﬁxed anxiously on the door leading from the companion ladder colonel denis would not be disappointed his daughter had fulﬁlled the promise of her youth and was very pretty girl she was slight and fair with regular features and quantities of light brown that twenty years ago was called fair before golden and locks came to put it out of fashion her eyes were rather uncertain but one thing was beyond all dispute they were beautiful eyes her complexion it was extremely pale at present and her very lips were white but this was due to her agitation to her awe and wonder and fear to her anxiety to know which of the many strange faces that came crowding into the cabin was the one that would welcome her and be familiar to her and dear to her long she lived she sat quite still with throbbing heart surveying each with anxious expectation colonel denis entered she half rose and looked at him appealingly you are helen he said in answer to her glance oh father she exclaimed tremulously now putting down the bag and stretching out her hands how glad i am that you are you sounds nonsense i know but i was half afraid that i had forgotten your face you know apologetically i was such very little thing and that man over there with the hooked nose stared at so hard that i thought was half and she paused and laughed little hysterically and looked at her father with eyes full of tears and he rather shyly stooped down and touched her lips with his grizzly the ice was broken helen seemed to immediately recover her spirits her colour and her ut she had never lost the use of that she was girl to what she had been ten minutes lips broke into smiles her eyes danced she was scarcely the same individual the frightened young lady whom we had ﬁrst seen sitting aloof at the end of the saloon table i remember you now quite well said miss denis i knew your voice and oh i am so glad to come home again this was delightful colonel denis man of but few words at any time was silent from sheer necessity now he felt that he could not command his utterance was beﬁtting to his sex if this meeting was rapturous to helen what was it not to him here was his own little girl grown into big was all the dif ference in short time miss denis and her luggage creery would be pleased to know that there was good deal of the latter were being rowed to ross by eight boatmen over sea that reﬂected the bright full moon it was almost light day helen and her father walked along the pier and up the hill homewards they passed bungalow on their the ﬁgure of girl who had long been lying in wait in the shadow of the verandah leant out they went by and watched them stealth ily then pushing open door and hurrying into room she said to her mother an enormously stout woman pg 15 pg 16 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https she has come she has ﬁgure like i could not see her face plainly but i believe she is anything to look at however those who had already obtained glimpse of miss denis in the saloon of the scotia were of very different opinion and according to them the spin was an uncommonly pretty girl likely to raise the average of ladies looks in the settlement by about ﬁfty per almost at the moment that colonel denis and his daughter were landing at ross another boat was putting her passengers ashore at aberdeen quentin very smart gig steep hill lay between him and his bungalow but declining the elephant in waiting he and lisle and another friend to whom he had given seat over commenced to breast the rugged path together this latter gentleman was parks the principal medical ofﬁcer in the settlement little man with sharp face grey whis kers and moustache and keen eyes to match he was comfortable of ﬁgure and ﬂuent of speech and prided himself on having the army list of the indian staff corps at his ﬁngers ends he could tell other men services to week knew to day when brown would drop in his and how much jones had had more than this he had an enormous circle of acquaintances in the three presidencies and if he did not know most old indian residents personally at any rate he could tell you all about who they married when and why who were their friends enemies or relations what were their prospects of promotion their peculiarities their favourite he was sort of animated directory with copious notes and prided himself on knowing india well another man knew london he was unmarried well off and lived in the east from choice not necessity he was exceeding ly popular in society was reputed to have saved two lacs of rupees and to be looking out wife after climbing the hill some time in silence parks to survey the scene in reality to take breath hold hard you fellows he cried the other two were walking on hold hard there hurry looks like scene in theatre does it waving hand towards the prospect below them with the moon lime light rejoined quentin he paused and glanced back upon the steamer surrounding boats and the sea all bathed in bright tropical shine at the many lights twinkling up and down the island like in wood parks remained stationary some seconds contemplating ross with his thumbs in the of his waistcoat at length he said i daresay old denis hardly knows himself with girl sitting opposite him i hope she will turn out well you mean that you hope she will turn out amended quentin turning and surveying his companion expressively ah parks you were always great ladies man nonsense sir nonsense i not thinking of her looks at all but the fact of the matter is that denis has had an uncommonly rough time of it and i trust he is in shallow water at last and that this girl will turn out to be what they call comfort to him i hope she will be comfort to us all i sure we want some consolation in this vile hole but why is old denis special charity inquired mr quentin old he is not so old if it comes to that in fact he is ﬁve years my junior and i suppose i not an old man am i demanded parks with spark of choler in his eye oh you you know that you are younger than any of us rejoined quentin quickly time never touches you but about denis oh he has had lot of bother and worry and you know that that plays the deuce with fellow the fact of the matter is that tom denis came to awful grief in money matters pg 17 pg 18 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https parks now walking on abreast of quentin and discoursing in ﬂuent conﬁdential tone his father affairs went smash and tom became security to save the family name mortgaged all his own little property that came to him through his mother exchanged from crack regiment at home and came out here into the staff corps it was foolish quixotic business altogether one was bit obliged to him his sisters thought he might have done more his father was callous old beggar and took everything he got quite matter of course and tom was the support of his relations and their scapegoat the very last animal i like to be remarked quentin but let interrupt you go on well if tom had not enough on his hands he saddled himself with wife he did not want either beautiful greek it seems that she burst into tears when he told her he was going to india and i not sure that she did not faint on his breast into the bargain however the long and the short of it was that tom had soft heart and he offered to take her out with him denis had lovely face an empty head heart and money in fact interest or connections or anything and she was the very worst wife poor man like tom she came out to bombay and carried all before her one would have thought she had thousands at her carriag es dresses and dinners my word they ran the governor wife pretty hard there was holding her at least it would have taken stronger man than tom denis to that she ﬂatly refused to live on the plains or to go within ﬁve hundred miles of his native regiment and his rôle was to broil in some dusty baking station and to supply my lady up in the hills or spending the season at poonah or bombay with almost the whole of his believe she scarcely left him enough rupees to keep body and soul together the man must have been fool said lisle emphatically now speaking the ﬁrst time aye fool about pretty face like many another growled the doctor there was denying her beauty the pure greek type her ﬁgure model every movement the poetry of motion she was cockney born though her father greek refugee conspirator whatever you like and of course prince at athens and the descendant of princes according to his own painter in london whose princess kept lodgers well denis was very clever with her pen and made capital imitations of her husband signature she borrowed freely from the soucars she ran bills in all directions she had vice in common with her kinsfolk of crete and she was the prettiest woman in india luckily denis i say it with all respect to her ashes she died after short but brilliant social career leaving him this girl and some enormous debts the fact of the matter was tom was ruined man and all these years between his father affairs and his wife liabilities his life has been long battle and poor he was and doubt is he never could say to needy friend and i need scarcely tell you that people soon discovered this agreeable trait in his character it pity he has not little more moral courage and that he never studied the art of saying remarked mr lisle dryly it merely matter of nerve and practice it not that exactly rejoined parks but that he is too much afraid of hurting people feelings too simple and unselﬁ sh i hope this girl who has come out will stand between him and this greedy world i should have thought it ought to be the other way so it ought but you see what denis is yourself turning and appealing to jim quentin go over to him morning and tell him that you are at your wits ends ﬁve hundred rupees and he will hand it out to you like lamb i only wish lambs were in the habit of handing out ﬁve hundred rupee notes i take to pastoral life returned quentin fervently casting woeful thought to the many long bills he owed in calcutta london and elsewhere pg 19 pg 20 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https let us hope miss denis will have some force of character said parks that the only chance him strong will like her mother minus her capabilities making the money ﬂy and few other weaknesses and here halting and holding out his hand our roads part not bit of it replied quentin taking him forcibly by the arm you just come home and dine with us doctor and tell few more family histories parks was little reluctant at ﬁrst declaring that he was due elsewhere that it was quite impossible it only the irwins i know and they will think you have stopped at will be all right come along thus parks was led away from the path of duty and down the road approaching quentin bungalow was rather curious to see the ménage that was the reason why he had been such an unresisting victim to jim invitation jim rarely entertained and much preferred sitting at other people boards to dispensing hospitality at his own dinner was cooked well served parks who was not insensible to culinary arts was both surprised and pleased he had known his host many years had come across him on the hills and on the plains on board ship and in the jungle they had host of acquaintances in common and after few glasses of claret and brisk volley of mutual reminiscences and stories parks began to tell himself that he was really very fond of apollo quentin after all and that he was one of the nicest young fellows that he knew and what about the man who sat at the foot of the table hitherto he had not been able to classify this lisle nor had he been so much interested in the matter other and idler people he had seen him often coming and going at aberdeen and had nodded him friendly and now and then exchanged few words with him his clothes were shabby his manner reserved parks understood that he was gentleman to whom quentin had given om and believing this he could not help feeling that he was performing gracious and kindly action in noticing him and doing the civil he would have called it himself to this beggarly stranger but now when he came to look at the fellow his appearance was changed what wonders can be worked by decent coat seen without his slouc h hat and rusty karki jacket he was quite another person and query was that reserved manner of his humility parks noticed that there was nothing subservient in his way of speaking to quentin quite the reverse that far from holding subordinate position in the establishment servants were more prompt to attend on him than on any one else and sprang to his very glance that he more than quentin looked after his parks wants and saw that his plate and glass were always replenished to his liking in which duties apollo who was good deal occupied with his own dinner and speculations on miss denis appearance was rather slack when the meal was over and the silent footed servants had left the room cigars and cigarettes were brought out and conversation became general lisle had plenty to say he had travelled much and had the polished manners and diction of man who had mixed with good society parks scrutinized him narrowly and summed up his age to be year or two over looked good deal younger without his hat his hair was black the traditional raven wing slightly touched with grey on the temples his eyes were piercing and very dark there was humorous twinkle in them at times that qualiﬁed their general was somewhat stern on the whole this lisle was handsome man in quite different style to his apollo who lounged with his arm over the back of his chair and seemed buried in thought he was undoubtedly gentleman and he looked if he had been in the service all the same this was but idle speculation and dr parks had not got any forrader than any one else the pause incident to lighting up lasted nearly ﬁve minutes then quentin roused himself ﬁlled out bumper of claret pushed the decanter along the table and said pg 21 pg 22 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https gentlemen ﬁll your glasses i am about to give you toast miss very good health what to dr parks are you not going to drink it come come ﬁll up ﬁll up oh yes i honour your toast i drink it he replied suiting the action to the word and now i follow it up by what you little expect and that speech all right make start you are in the chair but be brief goodness sake what is the text the text is not ﬂirt with miss denis oh and pray why not if she is pretty and agreeable and appreciative you know what i told you this very evening she is mere an inexperienced child she is denis one ewe lamb she is to be his companion the prop of his old age if you have any sense of chivalry spare her spare her ejaculated quentin with theatrical gesture of his hand one would think i was butcher or the public executioner i know proceeded parks your proclivities tender whisperings and in short the whole gamut of your attentions and that they never mean anything but too many forlorn maidens have learnt to their cost you most agreeable but evasive young man nodding towards his host with an air of pathetic expostulation i say come now you know this is ridiculous exclaimed quentin pushing his chair back he spoke but parks was in the vein expounding on his friend foibles and not to be silenced you know well i your imbecile weakness pretty face and that you can not resist making love to every girl you see until still better drives her out of your ﬁckle heart go on go on cried his victim you were loss to the church of course continued the elder gentle man clearing his throat i can readily imagine that society man before regions are vast desert you are thrown away here and are ﬁguratively castaway out of humanity reach and now fate seems induced to smile upon you once more in sending you possibly pretty creature to be the sharer of your many empty hours if i thought you would be serious i would not say anything or if this girl was hardened veteran of dozen seasons and knew the difference between jest and earnest again i would hold my peace but it is i sum up the whole subject in one word and with regard to helen denis i say hear hear cried his friend hammerin g loudly on the table doctor your eloquence is positively touching but you always were the ladies champion all the same you are exaggerating the situation i am most innocent inof come now james quentin how about that girl at poonah that you made the talk of the station how about the girls you proposed to up at matheran and murree what about the irate father who followed you to lahore and from whom you concealed yourself behind the counter eh now now doctor i cry peccavi spare before lisle who lay back in his chair smoking looking both bored and indif ferent you go in ladies society on ross said dr parks addressing him abruptly struggling to an erect posture and knocking the ash off his cigar i only know one lady over there and she is host in herself you mean mrs creery yes i allude to creery and at the very mention of the name they all three laughed aloud pg 23 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https and how about miss denis quentin you not given your promise said parks once more returning to the char ge i promise you one thing doctor drawled the host who was beginning to get tired of his persistence i not marry her now that you have let behind the scenes about her bewitching mother and i promise you that i go over and call and see if i can discover any traces of grecian ancestry in miss denis face and ﬁgure you are incorrigible i might well talk to the wall there only one hope the girl and that poor one poor it is let us have it chance that she may not be taken like out of every two dozen with ﬁckle jim quentin handsome face where has lisle gone to he added looking round into the verandah or to bed or out to sea the latter is just likely anything he did not approve of the conversation he thinks that ladies should never be discussed and he shrugged his shoulders expressively quite one of the old school eh said the elder gentleman raising his eyeb rows and pursing out his under quite laconically quentin i daresay you will think i bad creery but who is this fellow lisle and what in the name of all that slow is he doing down here who is he leaning over conﬁdentially oh he ﬁshes and shoots and likes the andamans awfully to who he is simply you see gentleman at lar ge and his name is gilbert lisle thus parks in spite of his superior opportunities was foiled and returned to his own abode wiser than any of his neighbours pg 24 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https iii first impressions and i am something curious being strange cymbeline the morning after her arrival helen denis found herself alone her father was occupied with drills and till twelve when they breakfasted she went out into the verandah and looked about her in order to become better acquainted with the situation of her new home the bungalow stood little way back from the gravel road that encircled the whole island and was shaded by luxuriant crimson creeper hedge of yellow ﬂowers bordered the path leading up to the door and between the house and the sea was clump of thick palms that stood out in bold relief against the deep cobalt background of the sky jays parrots and unfamiliar tropical birds were ﬂitting about and from the sea faint breeze was wafted bearing strange fragrant odours from the distant mainland light haze lay over the water betokening warm meridian few white clouds slumbered in the hot heavens overhead and save the hum of insects and birds and distant sound of oars swinging to and fro in the rowlocks the place was silent sunday morning in the country when every one has gone to ﬁrst helen stood and then she sat down on the steps to contemplate this scene which formed the prelude to new epoch in her gazed and gazed and seemed afraid to move her eyes lest the vision should escape her she sat thus without moving fully half an hour well what you think of it all young woman from voice behind her caused her to spring up and she found her father standing there in his white uniform with his sword under his arm oh papa i never never saw anything like it i never dreamt or fancied there could be such beautiful like fairylan d like an enchanted country like r similes running like robinson crusoe island rather dif ferent to brompton eh i suppose you had not much of view there view she exclaimed if there had been one we could not see it in the ﬁrst place we were shut in by high dirty brick walls and in the second all the lower windows were mufﬂed glass there was one window at the end of the that overlooked the road and though it was pretty high up it was all painted but some one had scratched little space in it right in the middle and often and often when i been saying my lessons or reading translations in class every idea has been sent right out of my head when i looked up at that pane and seen an eye watching always seemed to be watching but of course that was imagination it used to make feel quite hysterical at times and many bad mark it cost well you are not likely to get any bad marks here said her father laying his hand on her shoulder he spoke and you think you will like port blair it seems to to be kind of paradise i wonder half the world does not come and live here she replied emphatically to this remark ensued rather long silence silence that was at length broken by noise strange to helen ears the lovely scene before her was to her still admiring eyes this noise was loud ﬁerce hoarse shout something like an angry cheer she glanced at her father with somewhat heightened colour and in answer to her startled face he said those are the convicts they leave off work at twelve they are busy on the barracks just now stay where you are and you will see them pass presently pg 25 pg 26 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https approach of the convicts was heralded by faint jingling of chains that gradually became louder and louder and in few moments the gang came in sight escorted by four burly armed warders helen drew back pale and she watched this long silent procession ﬁle past two and two all clad in the same blue cotton garment all heavily manacled otherwise there was but little resemblance among them there passed the squat chinaman chained to the tall ﬁery pathan who ﬂung he went by glance of bitter hatred and deﬁance at the two european spectators they were in turn followed by brace of tattooed burmans who seemed rather cheerful than otherwise then few mild hindoos then more arabs more burmans more ﬁerce rohillas more mild hindoos helen stood almost breathless they glided by nor did she speak till the very last sound of clanking chains had died away in the distance poor creatures i had gotten them she said this place is paradise to prisoner poor creatures echoed her father the very scum and sweepings of her majesty indian murderers poor robbers poor dacoits and why are they in chains such heavy chains because they are either recent arrivals or desperate characters the former probably the worst of the creatures are not kept in ross but colonized in other gaols on the mainland or at viper and are there many here on ross about four thousand including women but some of these have and only go back to section is delicate way of putting night many of them are our servants our servants papa i am speaking of the settlement but our boatmen our water may well break it to you at cook are each and all people who have past that does not bear close inquiry and now my dear shall we go in to breakfast it was delightful change from his usual solitary meal to have that bright pretty face sitting opposite to him he watched her intently some was pouring out tea with all the delight of child i never done it before papa she exclaimed she despatched his be sure you let sawmy know or he will despise course being at school i never got chance miss twigg herself presided over the hot water and then in the holidays i had much better tea but i never made it ah your holidays helen that is what puzzled so much about your aunt julia i understood that you were always to spend your vacation with the platts i did once when i was small and i not think they liked so after lapse of ﬁve years they tried suppose to see if i was improved but these holidays were even worse than the others i have quick temper and i got into fearful trouble how oh it very old story and i hope and trust that i have more command of my feelings now i remember i was in the room at afternoon tea rather by accident i usually took that refreshment in her voice to stage the kitchen my cousins are good deal older than i were grown up then i perfectly recollect though they declare they were well but it is not question of your cousins age but of some domestic fracas that you were about to tell yes i always wandering from the point i recollect it was sunday afternoon some gentlemen were calling and they notice d and talked to and i was ﬂattered and doubtless pert they asked cousin clara who i was and where i and my class ic proﬁle pg 27 pg 28 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https from and aunt julia told them that i was her poor brother child and added something matter helen had never heard word with regard to her other parent save that she was beautiful greek who had died young her picture she had seen and this in itself was sufﬁcient her to idealize her and adore her azalie denis had the face of an angel i wo tell you what she said but i have never forgotten it in passion of rage and scarcely knowing what i was doing i snatched up cup of scalding tea and ﬂung it in aunt julia face yes cup and all you may imagine the commotion you can believe that i was in disgrace i was led solemnly from the room and locked away in lumber upstairs where i remained the rest of my vacation each day i was asked to apologize and each day i said i wo so there i stayed till i went back to school ere leaving i was taken down to my aunt apartment and told that i was wicked bad abominable child and that i would come to an untimely end and then cousin clara took up pair of big scissors and seizing my beautiful thick plait of hair sawed and hacked it of f close to the nape of my neck what cut of f your hair exclaimed colonel denis roused to sudden animation yes though i screamed and struggled it was of use i well remember the appearance of my poor pigtail in clara hand well after this you will not be surprised to hear that i was never asked to upper cream street again i was not sorry i never could get on with aunt julia i so glad that you are not bit like her papa she used to make shake in my shoes and how you know that i wo the same he asked with smile i sure you wo have another cup of tea please it strange that we have so few relations he said obediently passing his cup he spoke besides your aunt julia there only my sister christina she has been an invalid years and never writes is not she married to queer irishman who lives at place with ridiculous and aunt julia wo have anything to with her yes your aunt julia did not approve of the match this sheridan was kind of professor that christina met abroad most dreamy unpractical genius with magniﬁcent head and brogue that you could cut with hatchet after living some years in small german town they went over to ireland and there they reside on property that was left to him i write now and then and he might have added enclose cheque but christina never sends afraid they are very badly off shaking his head he stirred his tea now tell something about this delightful place papa i been reading good deal about it i mean the andamans they were ﬁrst taken possession of in 1789 by the british government or rather the east india company were abandoned in 1796 and resumed in 1858 the year after the mutiny i know it all nicely you know great deal more about it than i this is ross is it not yes the other settlements are scattered about people come over here to church to shop to play tennis and to hear the news and are there many other mean convicts and soldiers there are about ﬁfty men and ﬁfteen or sixteen ladies doubt you will have good many visitors oh papa you mean to call on yes of course who else would they come to see it makes feel quite nervous the palms of my hands are cold already only six weeks ago i was doing french composition and german translation and not daring to speak pg 29 pg 30 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https my breath without leave and now all at once i am grown up i am to receive visitors i may wear what i like and with an interrogative smile across the table i please long you throw cups of tea at people my dear now papa i very sorry i mentioned that if you are going to use it against but tell something about the ﬁfteen ladies who are likely to come and call well there is creery she is the wife of the head of the foolscap department and lives close to this hesitati ng she is very energetic woman but her hesitating manner is little against her rather arbitrary you know but we all have our faults then there is caggett her husband has some trade with burmah and his wife lives here in preference to moulmein miss caggett is our only young lady and you will see what you think of her home is the wife of the colonel of this only second ﬁddle you know you are certain to have kind friend in her then there is durand wife of captain durand of the european detachment here she is away just now and great loss to the place there are several ladies at whom you are sure to like i wish i was sure that they would like rejoined his daughter in rather melancholy voice you must bear in mind that i am not accustomed to the society of people and i know that i have conversation conversation and pray what have we been having the last of an hour oh that is quite different i can talk away to you by the week but with strangers what can i discuss even the weather i know what happens here it always ﬁne i suppose you will ﬁnd plenty to say i engage returned her father with emphasis and i have doubt he was going to add was cut short by the imperious rapping of an umbrella on the wooden steps of the verandah and shrill female voice calling boy pg 31 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https iv miss denis has visitors what his name and birth i can not delve him to the root shakespear there is mrs creery exclaimed colonel denis starting up rather nervously she has come to call ﬁrst keep her waiting to helen who was hastily smoothing her hair and pulling out her rufﬂes y will go into the my dear yes but not alone papa taking him by the arm you will have to introduce must come with you see she had begun to say must already denis was by means reluctant to present his pearl of daughters to the visitor who had prognosticated that she would be plain and he was sufﬁciently human to enjoy that lady stare of stolid astonishment she took helen hand and kept it in hers quite minute whilst she leisurely studied her face how you miss denis had you good passage very good thank you replied the young lady demurely i see sitting down she spoke and specially addressing colonel denis that you have had new curtains and purdahs put up and have actually bought that white marble table that kursandoss had so long on hand how much did you give it one hundred rupees replied the purchaser in guilty voice heavens and earth casting up hands and eyes did any one ever hear of such folly it is not worth thirty miss denis it good thing that you have come out to look after your is most extravagant man helen thought that this was pleasantry and laughed immoderately creery was really most amusing how oddly she was dressed she was quite old in helen eyes in truth she was not far from ﬁfty and yet she was attired in white muslin polonaise trimmed with bows and wore black sailor hat with the letters bacchante stamped in gold upon the ribbon mean while the elder lady had been taking great deal of interest in miss denis pretty she had come to the conclusion that the pattern was too complicated to be what is called carried away in her eye and was resolved to ask it boldly that before she was many days older you may go up to the mess she said playfully dismissing her host with wave of her plump mittened hand i want to have chat with your daughter alone i came to see her are novelty now my dear we shall be quite comfortable she said colonel denis meekly took his departure did you ﬁnd him much changed she continued lowering her voice mysteriously little but not nearly much changed i seem to him how much is he going to allow you the housekeeping helen assured her questioner that the subject had not even been considered creery on hearing this was visibly disappointed and said rather tartly well listen to anything under ﬁve rupees could not it less the durands spend that the homes say they manage on four but that nonsense and the children could not be half fed maybe your father will still leave it to ram sawmy but sudden ener you must not hear of that man is robber pg 32 pg 33 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https he has been twenty years with papa ventured helen so much the worse your father pocket returned creery emphatically i suppose you have brought out number of new gowns what have you got i have white silk and black silk replied helen with some exultation in her own mind they were her ﬁrst silk dresses both perfectly useless here snapped the matron stark staring madness there not horse between this and horse what else cashmere and plush costume you may just send it back to england or throw it away helen paused aghast well on go not all surely i have some pretty cottons and muslins and come that better and when are your boxes to be opened this afternoon if possible oh well i come down and see your things i may get some new ideas and we are little with the fashions here waving once more her mittened hand and now to turn to another subject it great responsibility young girl like you to be placed at the head of even small establishment like this i am older than you are it was quite superﬂuous to mention this fact i know the world and i wish to give you word of caution helen became crimson i hope you are steady sensible girl i hope so creery raising her chin in manner well known to miss twigg manner betokening insurrection there now be huffy i mean to be your friend i would have come down and stayed here the ﬁrst week or two to set you going if your father had asked you have lady in the house however i spoken to him most seriously all the men in the place will of course be ﬂocking to call and turning your head with their silly compliments rule they are not bad set of young fellows but quentin and captain rodney are the only two who i should say were in position to marry others are just oh and yes her voice became hollow and i must put you on your guard against mr lisle mr lisle echoed helen opening her eyes very wide yes forget the name he seldom comes over he lives at aberdeen with on him i should say correcting herself sharply he came here few months knows from where it is generally believed that he is in hiding that he is under cloud he is poor rat has visible means of livelihood and is close wax about his past however quentin shields him keeps his secret and there is nothing more to be said except you have anything to say to him he may have the impudence to call but indeed to give him his due he does not push it is most unpleasant feeling to have this black sheep living in the neighbourhood at all i wish he was well out of the settlement shaking her head expressively helen amazed at creery volubili ty sat staring at her in speechless surprise why should she take such pains to warn her against man who she admitted did not push and whom she was not likely to see another knocking in the verandah and rather timid voice calling boy announced the arrival of second visitor and creery rose saying pg 34 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https you will be coming up to the general tennis this evening and we shall meet again so i wo say then casting one last searching glance around the apartment she if seized by some afterthought hurried across coolly pulled back the purdah door curtain and looked into the nothing new there i see dropping the drapery after long exhaustive stare nothing but ﬁlter well au revoir and nodding approvingly at helen she ﬁnally took her departure the new arrival was complete contrast to the parting guest pale faded but still pretty little woman with imploring dark eyes like fawn attired in neat white dress solar topee and respectable gloves she was home the wife of colonel denis commanding ofﬁcer and the mother she plaintively informed helen of less than nine children they make so dreadfully anxious dear miss denis especially the seven at home i live on tenter from to imagine my feelings when they were all in measles last spring but this was feat beyond helen you have two here she asked politely after pause yes tom and billy your father is so fond of them and they wanted so much to come and see you but i told them you would think them the ﬁrst call too helen eagerly assured her visitor that they would have been most welcome and rushing impulsively out of the room returned with box of she had purchased her own delectation which she sent to the young gentlemen with her best love requesting that they would come and call soon possible this gift and message completely won their mother heart at ﬁrst she had been little doubtful little in awe of this pretty girl but now she became much warmer in manner and said you know my dear i not society lady i have time gaiety even if i were ﬁtted it between sewing my boys and girls at home and my letters and my housekeeping not to mention tom and billy i never seem to have spare moment i came down here early on purpose hoping to be the ﬁrst to welcome you but i was late after all and she smiled deprecatingly your father is such very dear friend of ours that i feel if i had kind of claim on you and hope you wo stand on ceremony with us but come to see us often you can will you i shall be very glad indeed thank you you see you and i being the only ladies in the too is kind of bond is it not if i can help you in any way abou t your housekeeping be sure you let know wo you i am an old campaigner of ﬁfteen years standing and everything of course is quite new to you you and your father i hope will come up and dine with us quietly night and then you and i can have very nice long chat helen thanked home her invitation and said that if her father was not engaged she was sure they would be most happy to accept it and now my dear said the little lady rising i must really go the dhoby has been waiting at home this i know and i have all the clean clothes to sort so i will wish you may i kiss you holding helen hand and looking at her with timid appealing eyes helen became rather red but smiled assent thereupon the salute was exchanged and home presently took her departure after this visit there was long interv al colonel and miss denis were equipped and ready to start the general tennis party when sawmy brought in another card small one this time bearing the name of james quentin the card was almost instantly followed by that gentleman looking if he had just stepped out of having cordially wrung his host hand and been presented to his daughter he seated himself near the young lady placed his hat on the ﬂoor and commenced to discuss the climate her passage surveying the new arrival critically at the same time she was much pg 35 pg 36 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https than he expected he said to himself he summed her up her proﬁle was not classical but it would pass her eyes were ﬁne in shape and colour though their expression was rather too merry his taste he imagined that she had plenty of spirits and but meagre supply of sentiment her complexion was perfect but of course that would not last three months on the whole he was most agreeably surprised and her dainty dress and ladylike deportment were refreshing to his eyes spring of water to traveller in the desert the shape of her hat the ﬁt of her long gloves her brilliant colour and pure english accent all mentally carried him back to the park once his mecca yes the fall of miss denis draperies the very lace in her rufﬂes were each source of gratiﬁcation to her visitor who had keen eye such things and was connoisseur in toilettes he told himself emphatically that this young lady was end of ﬁnd but aloud he politely inquired if colonel and miss denis were going up to the tennis they were well he was going sudden might he be permitted to accompany them james quentin felt an additional sense of importance he strolled up the narrow path towards the general grounds personally conducting miss denis coolly leaving her father to bring up the rear alone the pathway was too narrow to permi t of three abreast and he honestly believed that the young lady beside him could not be launched into settlement society under happier or more distinguished auspices pg 37 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https what is she like so sweet face such angel grace in all that land had never been helen found her reception most trying ordea she was very cordially welcomed by the general who instantly came forward to meet her and escorted her towards creery she ran the gauntlet of two groups of men who were standing on the ostensibly discussing the recent mail but naturally watching the new arrival who was the cynosure of every eye she passed by and approached row of seats on which the still more formidable seated in state creery who occupied the social throne in the shape of stuffed now rose majestically and like cedric the saxon advanced two steps saying in her most dulcet company voice very glad you have come miss denis i am charmed to welcome you to port blair helen blushed vividly was this august this almost regal individual the same who had questioned exhorted and warned her few hours previously she could scarce ly believe it but this was merely her ignorance that visit had been made in private capacity here creery was in public and responsible of chief lady of the station she now took helen hand in hers and proceeded to present her to her immediate circle caggett let introduce miss denis caggett rose made kind of plunge intended curtsey and subsid ed again muttering incoherently miss denis graham grah am is our musician she sings and plays most beautifully graham who was pretty brunette with lovely teeth shook hands with helen and smiled signiﬁcantly much to say you must not mind creery miss denis king has nice little girl and lives at viper miss denis logan our authores poor logan blushed till the tears came into her eyes and said oh creery please nonsense nonsense miss denis she has written the sweetest really exquisite ode called let see lifer lament and numbers of charming sonnets you must get her to read them to you some day alas logan who in moment of foolish expansiveness had mentioned her small poems under the seal of secrecy to another lady and had to her horror awoke and found herself famous manners miss denis and she paused if deliberating on what she could possibly say manners please mind about creery exclaimed that lady you know that i neither play nor sing nor write poetry manners was sprightly person regarded by creery with suspicion and dislike and she now glowered on her menacingly i am very glad to see miss denis and i hope she will overlook my numerous deﬁciencies quoth manners unabashed all the ladies had now been it were told off excepting miss caggett who approached and squeezed helen ﬁngers and looked up in her face and said pg 38 pg 39 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https so thankful dear that you have come it so wretched being the only girl in the settlement you ca think how i have been looking forward to this another squeeze miss lizzie caggett was small in person and mind and had very pretty little ﬁgure black hair bright eyes an ugly nose and an almost lipless mouth garnished with beautiful teeth she had been born in india had had three years at school in england and been out considerable number of seasons she danced like sylph talked hindostani like native and it was whispered that she gossipped with her ayah in that language dressed extrav agantly was lively and sufﬁciently to be considered she was the only unmarried lady among ﬁfty men she had shrewd eye to the main chance and never allowed her feelings to betray her save alas in the case of james quentin he from sheer lack of something to had been wont to spend his idle hours in miss caggett society she was amusing and lively and said such deliciously spiteful things of other women and told capital stories accompanied by vehement gesticulation with her tiny hands she had also nice little voice it came to pass that they sang duets together and walked on the pier by moonlight alone quentin meant nothing of course and at ﬁrst lizzie quite understood this but by degrees her strong foothold of common sense slipped away from under her feet and she fell desperately in love with the gay deceiver and naturally tried to convince herself that it was mutual she steeled herself to see him pay little attention to the rising helen would all that but when the novelty had worn off things would right themselves and fall back into their old that quentin would fall back into his at her side creery had previously broken the news to her that helen denis was looking and beautifully dressed but she was by means prepared the face and ﬁgure she beheld coming up the walk and james quentin in attendance already before she was hours on the island however she made brave struggle and bit her lips and clenched her small hands and broke into smile she had made up her mind to be the bosom friend outwardl y and if possible the conﬁdante of this tall denis girl after all who could expect her to be pleased to see young and pretty rival monopolizing every one attention and thrusting her into the background when all the introductions had been effected game of tennis was got up and number of little andamanese boys in white tunics and scarlet caps came forward from some to ﬁeld the balls and the settlement band which was stationed at the end of the plateau struck up their latest waltz and presently the entertainment was in full swing every one played tennis even creery who was old or young it suited her at the enough to ask questions to give advice and to lay down the law and to be treated with unquestioning deferen ce and deep respect sufﬁciently young to waltz to wear sailor hats and to disport herself at tennis helen had been the championess player at miss twigg and played well lizzie caggett sharp eyes noted this and after little while she challenged her to single set there and then vainly did helen decline to pick up the gauntlet vainly did she beg to be excused creery threw the weight of her authority into the scale and the match was to come off immediately capital idea match between the two girls she remarked to the general there will just be time it before tea before helen could realize her position ball was thrust into her hand crowd had gathered around and she alone stood to lizzie caggett on the it was one thing to play in miss twigg with spectators but miss twigg girls but quite another affair when one of the principals in contest before forty complete strangers and pitted against antagonist who knew every inch of the courts and was ﬁrmly resolved to try conclusions with this brilliant visitor pg 40 pg 41 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https so the match began the assembled bystanders watching each game intently and hanging expectant on the issue of each stroke the excitement grew intense the ladies were the play was brillian t and the games hard

which her sister lady grubb was the sun oh how utterly weary were creery intimates of those brilliant reminiscences the thousandth time did they not one and all detest the very name of grubb how was it people asked each other that creery had reigned so long and so tyrannically at ross how came she to occupy position from which nothing could dislodge had been mutinies there had been social risings but they all had been quelled even lady who had positively refused to go in to dinner unless she was taken in before creery had been quenched circumstances had placed the latter on the social throne

spent nearly all her time in the south of france according to creery south of france read lunatic asylum she herself was woman of robust constitution and always ready to say present consequently the

europeans and the convicts but even the savages of the interior these royal ideas had developed but little germ sown by the ﬁrst strains of god save the queen played she accompanied the general to presentation of prizes had thrown out roots and suckers and planted sense of her own dignity in her bosom that nothing but death could eradicate creery had children and ample leisure and with such magniﬁcent idea of her social status one will be surprised to hear that she condescended to manage the domestic concerns of all within her realms she had come to look upon this sacred duty and viewed all comings and goings with microscopic scrutiny the positi on of her house favoured this supervision it was close to the pier had good back view of the bazaar and the principal road ran by her door and consequently it is exaggeration to say that nothing escaped her from long practice she could tell at glance where people were going they ran the gauntlet of her verandah if the general wore

passing thought her whole attention was given to the ﬂowers she felt quite bewildered among such an embarras richesse and she paused every now and then to exclaim and to gather handfuls she was also in ecstasies at the and golden orioles that ﬂew with shocking tameness across their path miss caggett was accustomed to these sights her she had kept bottled up the beneﬁt of male companion and did not trouble herself to respond to helen raptures she had dogged her and purposely kept off malone and singled her out her own special associate in order that she she said to herself might have it out with her here in the jungle where she could be shrill she pleased one of the island peacocks where she could give reins to her wrath and one but her unsuspicious rival would be any the wiser on ross the very walls had ears the two girls wandered along one and the other laden with spoils till they came to an opening in the forest where there was very beautiful shallow pool apparently spring it was an unusual sight and lizzie halted and looked down into it and beheld the reﬂection of her own ﬁgure and of her at present very cross discontented little face seen in mirror set in lovely frame of ferns and mossy stones and graceful grasses she pondered over her own appearance and felt an agonizing thrill at the patent fact that she was now beginning to look old bright young face came into view over her bright young face that she hated from the bottom of her heart wonder she was prey to envy she gazed at helen reﬂection never had she looked better than in that soft white gown with wreath of eucharis lilies twined round her sailor hat lizzie stared and noted every item of that pretty vision and felt conviction of her own powerlessness to crush the horrible truth that one of those two faces was lovely and smiling and young and that the other was pinched and passée that other her own her day was on the wane the summer of her that it would come again she would sell her soul to recall it gone and in helen denis case she had all her golden youth before her these bitter thoughts were too much her her face worked convulsively the corners of her mouth went down and all of sudden she burst into tears helen was dismayed she led her gently to fallen log of ebony and implored of her to tell her if she was ill or what was the matter the tears were but summer shower and quickly spent and miss caggett came to herself dried her eyes and said that it was merely slight nervous seizure the result of racking headache and meant nothing but she added i tired and we may well rest here awhile there is hurry very well agreed helen i want to settle these ﬂowers they are in most dreadful state proceeding to arrange her basket then whilst you arrange your ﬂowers dear i will tell you story said lizzie now completely composed oh how nice of you i like stories and this is the very place one ghost story but mine is going to be said miss caggett brieﬂy i care them so much rejoined helen sorting out orchids she spoke however anything you like once upon time there was girl and she lived in the east indies with her mother her name was lizzie caggett she commen ced helen who was kneeling at the log using it table her ﬂowers looked up if she did not believe her ears her name i tell you was lizzie caggett she was not great beauty like some people but she was not young man came

was considerably brighter than usual girl arrived at port blair named helen denis and he paid her attention at ﬁrst because she was new half lives at her house he is always at her side and viciously he has made her the talk of the whole place he also rising and suddenly dropping the narra form plainer speaking is hypocrite he told you lie about that piano belongs to has pretended to you that he scarcely knew scarcely ever was out of our house is nearer the truth one thing he ca deny and that is his own look here dragging out thick packet of letters tied with blue ribbon you can read them if you like you wo in answer to scornful gesture then there tossing them violently on the ground where they fell with heavy thud and the ribbon coming undone lay scattered about like pack of cards miss caggett after this outbreak paused and folded her arms akimbo but her eyes were gleaming and her lips working convulsively helen was thunderstruck never had it dawned upon her till now that she had come and seen and conquered this furious lady lover the sudden announcement gave her shock and some seconds she was speechless there proceeded miss caggett pointing to letter at her feet three months ago i was his dearest lizzie and now you are his dearest helen and she laughed like hyena you are altogether mistaken and quite wrong cried her companion speaking at last i am nothing to him but an ordinary acqua intance and i think you should repeat these terrible things about him to you ca care very much him or you would not say that he is hypocrite and does not speak the truth to his making the talk of the place i am quite distressed to hear that port blair is so hard up topic helen was very angry and her face was an open book in which every emotion that swayed her was eloquently expressed quentin was utterly indifferent to her and this fact gave her considerable advantage over miss caggett besides being angry she was disgu sted and looked down upon her opponent with glance of unmistakable scorn of course you will tell him all i have said exclaimed lizzie with hysterical smile oh of course ironically miss caggett was ﬁlled with horrible fear that she had overshot her mark which had been merely to blacken quentin to helen to arouse her ire and take advantage of the ensuing quarrel and coolness and once more ingratiate herself with her late adorer but who would have expected miss denis to be supremely ironical and scornful and to have taken the news in this very strange way lizzie believed that girl living could be indifferent to james quentin instead of tearing her hair and weeping and denouncing him she was quite unmoved she had even spurned his letters hateful thing shall you tell him all i have said about him she reiterated deﬁantly your suggestion is of course prompte d by what you would yourself under similar circumstances returned her companion in cutting tone you pretend that you like him demanded miss caggett that you never told you thought him handsome you pretend that you are not in love with him and have lured him away from i pretend nothing i not even pretend to be his friend before his face and then abuse him unmercifully behind his back and now pointing with the tip of her shoe there are your letters i advise you not to leave them here the amusement of some picnic party and i request that you will never speak to in such way again nor mention the name of your friend mr quentin so saying helen picked up her basket turned her back on lizzie and walked off into the jungle in rather stately fashion never once looking back at

ignorance was bliss and she rambled on mechanically her mind not little disturbed by the recent scene lizzie caggett was not nice to quentin she had never quite trusted his dreamy blue eyes now she came to ponder over the subject his stories were often bad tale did not exactly match another forgot what he had said previously and although he had angrily disowned miss caggett yet she had noticed one mezzo soprano song among his music on which was scribbled in pencil lizzie with j love deeply occupied in unravelling various new ideas the young lady strayed further and further into the wood occasionally stopping to cull some too tempting ﬂower or pondering she plucked she was extremely reluctant to go back to the company and to face miss caggett after their late conversation but sudden cessation of birds notes duskiness and little chill wind warned her that it was really time to retrace her steps she had come further than she imagined and it was fully half an hour ere she had extricated herself from among the trees and once more gained the open space looking down upon the shore but what was this to her astonishment the beach was deserted there was sign of living creature to be seen save the dying embers of the gipsy ﬁre and did her eyes deceive her or did she really behold two heavily laden boats steadily rowing back to ross indeed one was already mere speck on the water and she had been left behind at ﬁrst she could not realize her position she the chief whose honour the party had been forgotten and abandoned to pass the night on that terrible desolate mainland alone she ran to rock jutting out far into the water and waved her parasol and screamed and called but the boats were far beyond earshot and the awnings were up she stood looking after them like modern dido with strange ﬁxed despairing eyes then turned and gazed behind her at the thick black and now forest that loomed all round her and encompassed the shore she sat down on the rock locked her arms round her knees and watched the two heartless boats till they were quite out of sight this operation lasted some time and when there was nothing further to be seen in the direction of ross she turned her face towards the open sea and beheld to her horror large canoe coming rapidly in her direction it was still at some distance but she knew that the build of the boat was not european nor did europeans go out boating in tall hats she did not wait closer inspection she dear up into the forest and dashe d among the underwood like mad creature in certain thick covert she threw herself down

big red war canoe and were about ﬁfty in number one or two remained in the canoe the rest sprang over the side and waded to by whole legion of dogs they swarmed round the ﬁre and found but little to

direction but these enterprising spirits had weight and helen although fainting with terror noticed that fat old man in huge cocked hat evidently person of much authority waved his hands with decision towards the horizon and making gestures at the big bank of clouds that were gathering there peremptorily collected all his party who immediately swarmed out into the canoe followed by their pack of

sea or capsized with all hands were but too well known at port blair the sky was now so inky black that it could scarcely look blacker low muttering thunder was heard from behind the clouds and an

storm that was coming up so rapidly he assured them that this delay would be but momentary few vigorous strokes and they were sufﬁciently near to make out that the seemingly blighted tree was the ﬁgure of european woman in white dress in two or three seconds they had touched the beach and lisle sprang out of the boat waded through the water and another instant brought him to the side of trembling distracted girl whom he had never seen before but who nevertheless accorded him though silent welcome helen after she had seen the last of the war canoe had once more ventured down to the shore the dark thick tropical jungle seemed to stiﬂe her and all she knew might be swarming with wild beasts the solitude was something appalling and the silence save queer outlandish sounds in the forest every now and then which caused her to tremble violently her position may not seem so very terrible to some people will say she knew she was sure to be fetched in the morning but night alone upon that savage coast was enough to make even man feel nervous much less girl like helen and by this time she was completely unhinged she sat staring into the gloom she suddenly made out boat positively european boat with three people in it the ﬁrst time her hopes rose she waved her arms frantically and she ran up and down the beach like demented creature she was seen and they were coming

indifferently but i think you are foolish what the good of two people getting wet when one will now wading out to the boat through surf which took the young lady up to her knees he got in ﬁrst helped her in afterwards and making sign to the impatient boatmen to raise the sail he said to his dripping companion there is going to be bit of blow mild way of putting it but we shall have it with us we shall be home in time he added in tone of assumed cheerfulness in few seconds they were gliding along over the water before nice stiff breeze and helen found time to collect her senses and to relate

beating very quickly that they were having more than mere blow they tore through the water all at once the ﬁrst splash of cold salt wave dashed over the boat and drenched her so unexpectedly that she could not refrain from stiﬂed exclamation but this was the only time that she lost her she sat motionless an image and neither moved nor spake not even when shrieking gust carried her hat away and whirled it into the outer darkness and the storm loosened her long hair and ﬂung it to the wind to play with how they ﬂew up the water mountains and were hurled down like stone into the corresponding valleys if they were to be drowned she hoped that it might be soon this present suspense was torture all was so awful opaque roar of the tempest the only sound it came in furious gusts then died away whilst wave after wave swept over the boat and now the low rumble of thunder burst suddenly into one frightful peal that seemed to shake the very sea itself blinding ﬂash lit up the gloom moment it was daylight helen involuntarily turned her eyes towards her companion and met his point blank in that second their two souls seemed to recognize one another in his glance she read intrepidity coolness and encouragement she at least was with brave man and might die in worse company he on his side noted the rigid ﬁgure of his passenger her locked hands and lips she was longer the timid shrinking creature he had dragged on board the gig less than an hour previously she was heroine capable of looking death in the face and death grim visage was never closer to her than now another

the surrounding howling darkness another awful plunge into the hollows and hissing of boiling waves and feeling of water closing all round them it seemed to helen if this was the had shipped heavy sea the boat reeled staggered and made another was not going to founder just yet the stricken boatmen shouted hoarsely to one another and baled in the dark helen crept unconsciously closer to the steersman and during lull in the blast she said you can swim lisle of course and if you escape will you take message from to poor papa i wo he answered roughly but i shall be drowned i know and she caught her breath at the chilling thought if you are i shall be drowned too you may be sure of that if i am saved you may rely upon it that you will be saved also we will sink or swim together if she does capsize lose your head and cling to whatever you trust and i take care of you but i hope it not going to come to that he added then after long silence and another blinding sea he exclaimed tha nk

up and down against the soaking pier in the presence of crowd of anxious faces who were peering over amidst the glare of torches and general excitement the ﬁrst person to greet them was colonel denis

from this presence so effectually kept any one she wished to speak to aloof and out of reach her natural good nature and politeness prevented her from actually dismissing him and she had not the wit or the experience to get rid of him otherwise she had indeed ventured on one or two timid hints but with regard to anything touching another person wishes jim had very keen perceptions and with respect to his own company being anything but ever welcome he would not have believed miss denis even if she had told him so in the plainest terms why should she be different to the rest of her sex

alas the world is full of contrariness quentin appreciated helen because she was difﬁcult to fascinate helen appreciated lisle because he held himself aloof and never gave any one the chance of acquiring that familiarity which notably breeds contempt and lisle was greatly surprised to ﬁnd that he was exceedingly envious of his friend that he admired helen denis more than any girl he had ever

helen was not her friend that she would rather have her little ﬁnger than quentin whole person that she would sooner marry the typical than him and that she had been very cross and tempered and hoped that helen would forget an occasion that it would make her blush to recall this was very ﬁne but who had ever seen miss caggett blush however helen was quite ready to accept the and like the to say pax there was considerable gathering at the band including quentin and creery humorously called them on band nights the former usually recline d on the sward literally and ﬁguratively at helen feet

that your little bachelor dinner went off quite nicely and that everything was eatable except the ice pudding helen felt annoyed quite nicely was indeed but faint praise after all the trouble she had taken and the success that she ﬂattered herself she had achieved she made reply but became rather red and you had quentin of course and the general and latimer and parks what champagne did you give

recently you were late in welcoming her to port blair i have the pleasure of knowing miss denis but to welcoming her to port blair such proceeding would be altogether presumptuous on my part and doubt

am sorry you could not dine with us last night lisle never dines out replied the elder lady speaking precisely if she was lisle interpreter quentin is talking of getting up dinner he said in fact he is rather full of it dinner well let him give it till full moon i hate crossing in the dark and be sure it is on said the elder lady authoritatively mutton was only procurable once week i will remember your suggestions but good deal depends on the butler and his inclination he is rather an imperious person we have but little voice in the domestic arrangements you of course not but i should hope that quentin is master of his own house he leaves all to abraham and generally everything has turned out perhaps the writing of the menu last time people were little startled on glancing over it to see that they were going to partake of lion and jam pupps helen laughed delightedly but the elder lady gravely said oh roast loin and jam puffs well that the worst of not having lady in the house such mistakes never happen in my establishment would you like to take turn now miss denis said lisle glancing at her he spoke i daresay she would and so would i returned creery briskly rising and walking at the other side of him an honour which he was by means prepared what is that unearthly noise inquired helen what are those sounds that nearly drown the band yes reminds of pig being killed

wholesome dainty edibles their young people they are sitting in circle whooping and yelling real bonâ ﬁde savages would you like to come out and see them certainly not exclaimed creery indignantly at

nearly beat out the brains of another convict with his hoe merely excusing himself on the plea that he was tired of life and wanted to be hanged however his victim recovered we were unable to oblige him and he was heard to say that he would white man next time last night just before they went to section he was missed and one of the warders was sent to look him but he did not return general search was made and the warder was found on his face among the reeds stabbed through the heart and aboo was still missing i glad he is on the mainland ejaculated creery with shudder i would not change places with manners triﬂe then he is not so desirous of being executed you imagined said lisle he did not give himself up not he rejoined the general life is sweet his threats meant nothing perhaps he has

photographs last fatal they were vain the moment they landed in bombay thanks to their photos the police wanted them sent them back to and here they are yes the boats were great temptation but now they go off on logs said latimer and even take to the sea in chains the malays especially can swim like ﬁsh however their are getting too sharp them the reward of ﬁve rupees puts them on their mettle

to escape and their determ ination to land him once or twice we were all within point of going over my screams and expostulations were quite useless the natives are very sharp after convicts too said

ﬁnger of fate agreed her companion and if i were superstitious i would say that it was pointing straight at us perhaps there may be some remote connection between our planets perhaps they are identical they stood gazing the phenomenon gradually melted away before their eyes and was replaced by the moon which now rose out of the sea like huge ﬁre balloon the moon is irrepressible out here remarked mr lisle she seems always to the fore so much the better replied helen these eastern nights are splendid i wonder way why the moon has always been spoken of by the feminine gender the lady moon oh that question is easily answered she is never the same two days running now lisle i call that base reﬂection on my sex i believe we are half changeable foot on sea and one on shore to one thing constant never pray to whom does that refer and she looked at him interrogatively i could give you dozen quotations on the other side but i will spare you it is my opinion that women are changeable weathercocks an opinion founded on your own experience well i am wise i proﬁt by the experience of my friends oh rather scornfully things are never valuable lisle laughed and said well let us quarrel what did we start with oh the moon and gazing over at that orb he added i too can repeat poetry miss denis and this seems just ﬁtting place to quote constellations moons and happy skies

charming place if you have taste conchology you will have any quantity of shelling in most cases the shelling is angrily repudiated and yet the chances are that once arrived upon the scene of action and stimulated by general example and keen emulation the will develop into the most unwearying rabid and greedy of shellers when i say greedy sheller i refer to an individual who when tide wind and

swagger dripping up the pier between two lines of outraged acquaintances with shameless air of ah ha see what i have got from the general down to billy home every one went shelling at port blair and some of these shell maniacs creery dubbed them had superb and valuable collections there was much excitement and competition over day quest would be expended on covert shooting or salmon ﬁshing at

then one afternoon few days after the band two large waiting at the pier shellers and kindly notice the party coming down to embark an inexperienced eye would naturally assume that they were all going to bathe each individual carries bag and couple of bath put round the back of their heads they stoop in the sun their garments are whole indeed and quite good enough the occasion but how faded and shrunken and cockled with their boots we will draw veil over these to be brief the appearance of the company is the reverse of distinguished in few short happy hours they will return they will be all soaking in water from the waist downwards luck ily wading about in the nice warm sea is rather pleasant after the ﬁrst plunge and people in the excitement of shelling are insidiously drawn in deeper and deeper still yes by six if all goes well we shall see the company of shellers returning like party of rats but there will be shyness reluctance in their progress up the pier without the least difﬁdence they will run the gauntlet of all the idlers with an air of lofty pride born of the noble spoils they usually carry have they not in their bags such treasures woodcocks staircases tigers and

when the andamans were opened up where she came from and what had been the fate of her crew and never now be learned from her rigging it was guessed that she was of american build that was all even in the brilliant afternoon light she appeared grey and weird with her skeleton gear aloft and her dark ports looking like so many hollow eyes she lay among the tall bulrushes sheathed in her cabins and

seemed much larger and more at close quarters and they rowed under her stern helen in her secret heart was rather sorry that she had been so determined to spend two hours upon the wreck alone that all the way down she had jeered and laughed at malone warnings of cockroaches and ghosts however there was possibility of changing her mind now especially with lizzie caggett inquiring eyes bent upon who was mentally revelling in the prospect of the undivided attentions of all miss denis admirers the next two hours now that it has come to the pinch i believe you are afraid she remarked with malicious smile the only reply that helen vouchsafed to this taunt was by immediately standing up greatly to her surprise creery also rose saying i think i go with you nip is fond of snifﬁng among old timber and he hates shelling like his mistress one clamoured against their departure and helen was once in her life glad of creery society and grateful to nip the two ladies were presently helped over the side nip being cautiously carried up by the scruf f of his neck and the party were left by themselves to the last malone pressed helen to think better of it quarter of an hour will be more than ample

added she full of rats the sound of the oars grew fainter and fainter helen went to the bows from whence she hoped to make her sketch and stood silently looking at the the wooded hills casting deep shadows into the glassy water at the arm of the sea they had just come up and out in the open ocean like green gem in silver distant island of ross it was undoubtedly latimer had suggested capital

evidently about to depart when creery casually remarked if it were mere afterthought oh miss denis is here too sketching apparently this intelligence altered the case the gentleman paused rested on his oars and said rather nonchalantly very well i shall come you wish it so particularly and rowing round made fast his boat and was soon on deck closely followed by big brown retriever oh dear cried

imparted to her friends and acquaintan ces that from what she saw of the invalid it would never surprise her to hear that there was insanity in the denis family and she would not be astonished if she

story uncommonly well so also said public then their reading of the word story was not exactly the same hers she had brought herself to believe that she had been the only person on the wreck who had

in the ofﬁce and af fairs of love shakespear things went on much usual after this at port blair there were more tragedies nothing startling to record and people had quietly settled themselves down to wonder if lizzie caggett would catch malone and when the quentin and denis engagement would be given out there had been the ordinary settlement amusements including grand picnic to mount harriet the last place lord mayo visited before he was stabbed on the pier below mount harriet was very high hill covered with trees and dense jungle and on the top of it was situated the general country bungalow he did not often live there himself but it was in constant demand by people who wanted change also honeymoons and picnics from the summit of the hill there was magniﬁcent view of inland winding water islands mountains and sea but this view was only to be obtained by steady mile climb from the pier and an eleph ant jampanees men carrying chairs and two ponies awaited the picnic party the elephant at mount harriet was character he was ﬁfty years of age and his name was chootie once upon time he had got tired of drawing timber and slaving the indian government and had coolly taken holiday and gone off into the bush where he had remained three whole years however here he was caught and once more in harness waiting very discontentedly at the foot of the hill with structure on his back resembling an irish jarvey minus wheels which was destined to carry six passengers helen and lizzie caggett with happy malone between them went on one side creery quentin and home on the other and presently they started off at quite brisk pace but the day was hot the was rugged and chootie paused like human being and seemed to express wish to contemplate the landscape his mahout expostulated in the strongest language hindustani what did he want ter then he was not going to get that he was nevertheless he exhausted his vocabulary in vain vainly did he revile chootie ancestors in libellous terms chootie remained inﬂexible until two policemen armed with very stout sticks arrived and whacked him with might and main and once more he started off again and kept up promising walk nearly half mile and now the praises lavished on him by his doating driver were even sweeter than new honey but alas he was praised too soon without the slightest warning he suddenly plunged off the road down place steep the side of not church deaf to creery screams and the mahout imprecations he had happened to notice banana was extremely partial to bananas he made his way up to it tore off all the branches within his reach and devoured them with much deliberation and satisfaction if there were not seven furious frightened howling screaming human beings seated on his back he ﬂatly refused to stir until he chose the policemen were not within sight and he seemed to be tossing halfpenny in his own mind to whether he would go ramble through the jungle or return to the path of duty which led to mount harriet and his afternoon rice the afternoon rice had it and he accordingly strolled back nearly tearing his load off the howdah he passed under big that he evidently considered was entirely their then climbed in leisurely manner up the steep bank he had recently descended and resumed the public road stopping now and then to snatch some tempting morsel or to turn round and round in very disagreea ble fashion the fact was he was not accustomed to society nor to carrying load of and he did not like it dragging timber and conveying stores was far more to his taste and besides this creery pg 117 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https and her lively green umbrella annoyed him excessively he had taken special dislike to her was not an amiable elephant and would have thoroughly enjoyed tossing the lady with his stamping on her subsequently at last the party found themselves in front of the mount harriet bungalow to their great relief and delight and scrambled down ladder of course their late conveyance would not condescend to kneel creery once safe on terra ﬁrma was both bold and furious and standing on the steps harangued the mahout in hindustani on the enormity of the elephant behaviour she called him all the epithets she could immediately bring to mind said she would complain to the general and have him shipped to the he was an ugly unruly untamed brute naturally the elephant understood every word of this hindustani is to them it were their native language he calmly waited till the irate lady had said her say and furled oh foolish dame her umbrella and then he slowly turned his trunk in her direction like hose there was whish and instantly she and her elegant costume were drenched from head to foot in dirty water what spectacle she was what scene ensued vainly she ﬂed the wetting was an accomplished fact it had been very sudden and disastrously complete malone actually lay down and rolled in the grass like the rude uncivilized irish savage that he was miss caggett was absolutely hysterical and screamed like peacock helen and home with difﬁculty restraining themselves endeavoured to ameliorate the condition of the unhappy lady they escorted her inside the bungalow helped her to remove her gown gloves and hat she was once in her life actually too angry to speak wept her dress had to be dispatched to the to be washed and dried and she of course was in consequence prevented from taking the head of the table and had to have her meal sent out to her in the retirement of the bedroom where she discussed it alone and the worst of it was that she met with but little real sympathy when she reappeared once more in public she was met with wreathed smiles and broad grins such is friendship the company wandered about the hill after dinner and helen thinking to checkmate james quentin once offered her society to parkes who was only too pleased to accompany long she did not go too far and there was climbing to punish miss denis her want of taste apollo once more devoted himself to lizzie under the foolish impression that in so doing he was searing helen very soul it was soon there was moon wonder people had to depend on the stars and the and creery had had most disagreeable day the signal an early departure they all descended by long steep winding pathway through the jungle instead of by the more public road their boats were awaiting them at hopetown pier creery led the van in jampan carried by four indeed all the ladies preferred this mode of transport to trusting themselves again to chootie who was the bearer of some adventurous spirits whom he took right through the jungle thereby reduc ing their garments to rags and covering their faces with quite pretty pattern of scratches quentin travelled per jampan but lisle walked and considered that he had much the best of it so he he walked at helen denis right hand and they both found this by far the most delightful part of the day this was due to the surrounding inﬂuences or to each other society i will leave an open question about dozen men accompanied the procession with ﬂaring lights it wound down and down the rugged pathway through the forest and gave the whole scene fantastic and picturesque appearance it was lovely night though moonless millions of silent stars spangled the heavens millions of twinkled in the jungle helen never forgot that balmy tropical evening with the glow of torches illuminating the dark luxuriant underwood the scent of the ﬂowers and the faint sound of the sea lisle realized he descended that steep that he was deeply in it at last and in love with this helen denis helplessly in in he might not speak nor ever tell his love he could only play the part of conﬁdant to james quentin and perchance the thankless rôle of best man little did he guess that the young lady at his side was not wholly indifferent to him that her blushes when he appeared with jim were to be put down to his own not to his pg

believed girl only smiles on man she cares yet jim was was yards behind leaden burden to his lagging bearers wild ecstatic idea ﬂashed through his mind that she not care quentin after all but this notion was speedily extinguished by his friend who had noticed lisle in attendance on miss denis on the way down the hill that they stood little apart on the pier before embarking and neither liked nor loved the thing he saw lisle the invulnerable was proof longer lisle was fellow despite his shabby clothes and sunburnt skin yes he had somewhat overlooked that fact but lisle was not ladies man and he was man of honour and quentin fully determined to give him to understand that he must not trespass on his preserves miss denis belonged exclusively to him and now let us privately examine quentin mind brieﬂy stated he did not mean anything in other words he did not wish to marry her that fevered dream was past he was not an atom in love with her either she was too irresponsive and in fact he expressed it to stupid between ourselves if any wandering damsel had appeared upon the scene he was ready to whistle miss denis down the wind at once but damsels were rare at ross he still admired her greatly he did not mean to drop her till he went away and he intended to take precious good care that one should have it in their power to say that she had dropped less abandoned him another his character killer was at stake he could not and would not lose what was precious to him the very breath of his nostrils he accordingly took an early opportunity of giving lisle what he called bit of hint i saw you making yourself very agreeable to the fair helen yesterday he rema rked with affected bonhomie you must make yourself too agreeable you know why not demanded his companion with exasperating composure why not my dear fellow the idea of your asking such question you know very well why not am i to understand that she is engaged to you quentin hated these direct questions and why should lisle look at him if he were witness that he was examining on his oath what is it to you he returned evasively come now lisle leaning on his elbow and smiling into the other face with one of his most insinuating expressions answer my question ﬁrst roughly well i will word fencing was easy to him and he never thought it any harm to dissemble with woman and juggle his sentences so that one almost neutralized another they were fair game but man was different with men he could be frank because he had more respect his own sex and secondly because their eyes were not likely to be blinded by love admiration or vanity meanwhile here was lisle an obstinate downright fellow sternly waiting his reply an answer he must have so he made bold plunge and said with lowered eyelids and in conﬁdential voice what i tell you is strictly masonic i know you are to be depended on there is actual engagement yet between helen and there is an understanding i confess the distinction is too subtle pray explain it how can i go to her father whilst my money affairs are in such confounded muddle until i can that we can not be what you call engaged you see pg 121 pg 122 project gutenberg

the art of innuendo and the management of the various inﬂections of the human voice he was matchless amateur star and could act of f well on the stage after receiving this conﬁdence lisle was silent

roused himself once more then she is engaged to you not quite not our position is such that man of honour knowing it would take advantage of the situation he course not and with this admission the subject dropped quentin had succeeded brilliantly he had assured lisle that he was not engaged and yet he had impressed him with the fact that an engagement he had almost persuaded himself that there was an understanding between him and helen understanding was good useful elastic word it might mean an understanding to play tennis to sit next each other at an afternoon tea or to share the same

doctor pointing to white sail approaching the island it easy to see what you have come down my boy to apollo who smiled signiﬁcantly and accepted the soft impeachment without demur quentin is lucky fellow is he said green addressing himself to lisle with all the enthusiasm of ignorance he has had it all his own way from the ﬁrst none of us were in it and although our circle of ladies is small i venture to say we could show beauty against madras or rangoon yes and i throw in calcutta too i back belle hélène against anything they like to enter pace shape and looks here mr lisle turned upon his heel and walked away what up what the matter eh demanded the youth of quentin who was now gazing abstractedly at the approaching boat with cigarette between his teeth oh he did not approve of your conversation he does not think ladies should be talked about and all that sort of rubbish pooh why not was i not praising her up to the skies what more could i have said and i sure if you mind he need

cried the sprightly lizzie surveying the guilty group with great digni ty i call this pretty behaviour what lazy selﬁsh set beginning piano and ending crescendo malone nodded his head like mandarin at each of these adjectives and declared so they are miss caggett so they are i quite agree with you the young lady merely darted scornful glance in his direction and proceeded quentin well i given you up long ago green i can not say much to you when people set you such an example slap at green tender years lisle you here and pray what have you got to say yourself what is your excuse my excuse coming forward and dofﬁng his hat is that i have more idea of decorating room than one of the settlement fact my genius is of destructive rather than of constructive order but i am always prepared to appreciate other people handiwork well you are cool staring at him second in scornful silence now malone pointing at him with her parasol let us hear what you have got to say yourself malone rested his chin on the top of his and calmly contemplated his fair questioner in somewhat dreamy fashion and then was understood to say that long miss caggett was in any other decoration was quite superﬂuous to which miss caggett responded by rapping him on the knuckles with the handle of her sunshade and saying blarney meanwhile durand had joined the group and now received very warm welcome it was easy to see that she was popula r person at port blair she was upwards of thirty with full but very erect ﬁgure smilin g dark eyes good features and white teeth the upper row of which she showed very much she talked she wore hat with dark blue veil pretty cambric dress and carried red parasol over her arm grand landmark that same parasol creery great events never happen alone quoth malone bowing over

hitherto entirely concealed his friend and he moved durand eyes fell upon gilbert lisle she opened them very wide shut them and opened them once more and said in slow staccato voice i believe i am not dreaming and that i see lisle lisle holding out plump and eager hand what on earth brings you here precisely what every one wanted to know durand had habit of laying great stress on some of her words and she uttered the word earth with extraordinary emphasis pg 127 pg 128 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https acquaintance upon whom all eyes were now riveted smiled shook hands muttered incoherently and contrived by some skilful manœuvre to draw the lady from the centre of the crowd i never was so amazed in my life she reiterated what put it into your head to come here of all places oh i wanted to see something out of the common and to enlar ge my ideas indeed i did not know that they required extension one could understand our being are sent like the convicts but of all people you there is ﬁshing to be had and boating and all that sort of thing and the scenery is perfect he answered pray how long have you been at port blair i came in july he replied rather apologetically july she echoed and this is november ﬁve months and may i ask what is the attraction besides sailing and sharks the unconventional life the temporary escape from politics and post cards express trains telegrams and the bores of one acquaintance well every one to their taste of cours you like port blair give park lane to politics we have our politics here have you not discovered that we are an absolute monarchy yes smiling but alas i am not in favour at court neither am i in the opposition i one of the reds laughing and displaying all her teeth here are all these people coming

spoiled yet by the way pausing and looking at him signiﬁcantly i wonder if you have been losing your heart well enlar ging your ideas i ever lose my heart he asked am i an inﬂammable person the reverse warranted not to ignite i should say shaking her head and now i really must be going or creery will catch and of course we shall meet this evening lisle walked with her to the end of the pier bending towards her and apparently speaking with unusual earnestness miss caggett remarked at the gate he and the lady parted he taking off his hat she waving her hand towards him twice if to enforce some special injunction the gig was now alongside the steps and its late passengers had ascended to the pier miss denis was the last to leave the boat and was at once surrounded by quentin malone captain rodney and green faithless quartette who all quitted miss caggett in body well miss denis said green i am glad to see that you have not forgotten the i asked you to bring pointing to ﬂower in the front of her dress oh this taking it out and twirling it carelessly in her ﬁngers i certainly did not gather it your adornment but still if you like half tendering it but becoming conscious of quentin greedy outstretched hand she paused you surely would not he began pathetically i would not certainly not i will give it to the sea and suiting the action to the word she tossed it over the railings into the water oh miss denis exclaimed gree n with groan how could you triﬂe with my feelings in such manner how could you raise to pinnacle of happiness and cast down to the depths of despair have you conscience pg 129 pg 130 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https it would have been precedent she answered gaily i know you only too would have demanded bouquet every time i returned to the island here the ﬁrst time her eyes fell upon lisle who had now joined the outer circle lisle whom she had not seen six weeks she coloured with astonishment and accorded him rather stiff little bow he did not come forward but contente d himself with merely raising his hat and remaining in the background helen had once rather timidly asked after him from quentin it seemed so strange that he had never been over to ross since the day of the picnic when they had made that never gotten expedition down the mountain escorted by torches and to miss denis somewhat faltering question quentin had brusquely replied that lisle had on one of his sulky ﬁts and the chances were he would not come over to ross was an odd unsociable surly sort of beggar apparently he had now recovered from the sulks there he stood looking sunburnt shabby and ever we had pleasant sail remarked creery but i could not go in at chatham on account of nip graham makes such fuss about that hideous puppy of after all it only nip play of course i could not leave the poor darling in the boat by himself so we had our tea sent out to us and were very happy all the same hugging him she spoke with sudden rapture but nip whose play was death to other dogs stiffened his spine and threw back his head he evidently considered public endearments inconsistent with personal dignity he weighed fully pounds and why creery carried an animal who had the excellent use of his four legs was best known to herself she proceeded up the pier with his head hanging over her shoulder he surveyed malone and lisle who walked behind him with unconcealed contempt what fool she makes of herself about that beast muttered the former he despises us not being carried too i see it in his eye brute i like to vivisect him only imagine exclaimed miss caggett suddenly miss denis has never been to dance in her life giggling af fectedly never danced with any but girls and remember said jim quentin impressively turning and speaking to helen in tender undertone the beneﬁt of his friend that you have given the promise of the ﬁrst waltz the party had now reached little square from whence their various paths diver ged you wait on the pier like good fellow he said to his companion i am just going to walk home with miss denis every one now departed in different directions excepting creery who remained behind at the moment and waving her green umbrella called after them authoritatively now mind that none of you are late this evening you men lisle went slowly back to the pier it was almost deserted

of crimson ﬁre apparently he is unconscious of ﬁgure who comes and leans over the railings with his eyes ﬁxed abstractedly on the sea till with sudden ﬂash they become riveted on something scarcely deserving such eager ﬂoating ﬂower gilbert lisle gazed he was the prey of sore temptation surely he argued with himself there would be harm in picking up castaway lily even quentin would hardly grudge him that and he might well have it the sea then he turned half away if thrusting the impulse from him the convict now noticed him the ﬁrst time but the ﬂower was potent and drew him back he pg 131 pg 132 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https his arms on the railings and stared at it steadily the zemindar watched him narrowly out of his long black eyes the sahib was debating some important question in his own mind he looked at his watch he glanced nervously up and down the pier apparently his companion was noug ht then he hurried to the foot of the steps and unmoored punt and rowed out several lengths in quest of what white ﬂower that the tall english girl had thrown away the native followed his quest with scornful interest he has it now it has evaded him and still ﬂoats on ah he has reached it this time he has lifted it out of the water reverently if it were one of the sacred hairs of buddha he has dried it he has concealed it in his coat bah the feringhee is

and ﬂooding ross with light that was almost ﬁerce in its intensity the island seemed to be set in silver sea over which various heavily laden boats were rowing from the mainland conveying company to the ball jampans bearing ladies were to be seen going up towards the in single ﬁle the guests kept pouring in and despite the paucity of the fair sex made goodly show we notice creery who would not in crimson satin with low body short sleeves and black velvet coronet on her head helen denis in white muslin with natural ﬂowers she had been forbidden by the former lady to even so much think of her white silk but had nevertheless cast many yearnings in that direction all the same she looks well her best friends could wish and certain nervousness and anticipation gives unwonted brilliancy to her colour indeed miss caggett has already whispered paint and unusual brightness to her eyes the world seems very good place to her this evening she is little more than eighteen and it is her ﬁrst dance if she has an arrièr pensée it has to with lisle who after being shall we say interesting and behaving so heroically has calmly subsided into his normal state viz obscurity what is the reason of it why will he not even speak to her little does she guess at the real motive of his absence little that during his long daily excursions by land and sea face hers forms constant background to all his

by dozens of the ﬂoor was smooth glass and all the most comfortable chairs in ross were disposed about the and verandahs the men were struggling into their gloves and hanging round the door is their usual behaviour preliminary to dance and the seventeen ladies were scattered about though resolved to make much show possible creery occupied conspicuous position she stood exactly in the middle of the holding converse with the general who bowed his head acquiescently from time to time but was never so mad to try and get in word edgeways nip was seated on sofa alert and wide awake plainly looking upon the whole affair tomfoolery and nonsense but he had been to previous entertainments and knew that there was such thing supper near the door stood miss caggett the centre of noisy circle dangling her programme and almost drowning the bass and tenor voices by which she was encompassed with her shrill treble and shrieks of discordant laughter at malone muttered witticisms her dress was pink tarletan made with very full skirts and it ﬁtted her neat little ﬁgure to perfection altogether miss caggett was looking her best and was serenely conﬁdent of herself and severely critical of others every one had now arrived save quentin but he thoroughly understood the importance of tardy and solitary entrée at last his tall ﬁgure loomed in the doorway and he lounged in with an air of supreme nonchalance just the preliminary bars of the opening lancers were being played he was not alone to every one amazement he was supplemented by lisle in evening dress there had been grave doubts to his possessing that garb and his absence from one or two dinners had been leniently attributed to this deﬁciency in his wardrobe people who looked once at james quentin looked twice at gilbert lisle they could hardly credit the evidence of their senses lisle in unimpeachable clothes with pg 133 pg 134 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https matchless tie wide expanse of and gloves was totally different person to the individual they were accustomed to see in rusty old coat ﬂannel shirt and disreputable how much depends on man tailor here was the loafer transformed into handsome if rather bronzed gentleman he received the ﬁre of many eyes with the utmost equanimity he leant lazily against the wall like his neighbours miss caggett having breathed the words borrowed plumes and giggled at her own wit presently beckoned him to approach and said pertly this is indeed an unexpected pleasure i thought you said you were not coming mr lisle did i pausing before her very likely but unfortunately i am the victim of constitutional vacillation in plain english you often change your mind never about miss caggett bowing deeply and presently retiring to the doorway chuckled and considered that lizzie they called her among themselves had got the worst of that creery who had been gazing at this late arrival with haughty amazement now longer able to restrain herself advanced upon him if marching to slow music and said i just had letter about you mr lisle lisle is to say his tan became of still deeper shade of brown and his dark eyes they met hers had an anxious uneasy expression oh yes triumphantly i know all about you and who you are and i shall certainly make it my business to inform every one not goodness sake mrs creery he interrupted eagerly the greatest of favours and keep what you know to yourself creery reared back her diademed head like cobra about to strike and was on the point of making some withering reply when the general accosted her with his elbow crooked in her direction and said i believe this is our dance and thus with nod to her companion implying that she had by means done with him she was led away to open the ball meanwhile helen had overheard graham whisper across her to home what you think when creery came back from us she found her letters at home and she has heard something dreadful about mr lisle helen was conscious of thrill of dismay she listened she was so perplexed and so preoccupied that she scarcely knew what she was saying when quentin came and led her away to dance during the lance rs she was visibly distrait and her attention was wandering from the ﬁgures and her partner but she was soon brought to her senses by quentin saying rather abruptly i just heard most awful piece of news heart bounded only fancy their sending to the nicobars helen breathed more freely she stammered out the nicobars yes the order came this evening by the scotia i sail in her camorta at and must you go really yes of course i must is it hard lines some bother about the new barra cks the nicobars are ghastly hole poisonous place i shall be away two is if i ever come back he added in lachrymose voice and what about mr lisle pg 135 pg 136 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https oh he is such beggar seeing new is coming too i sorry you are going to the nicobars they have such bad name fever and malaria i believe you i hear the malaria there rises like lisle is foolish to go you should not let him oh he may well be there here he is hard nails and it would be deadly without companion he promised to come and i sha let him off though i must confess what he says he sticks to miss denis thought quentin arrangement savoured of abominable selﬁsh ness and between this news and the sword of damocles that was swinging over lisle head her brain was busy dancing went on merrily but she did not enjoy herself nearly much she anticipated after all this apple of delight her ﬁrst ball had turned to dust and ashes in her mouth and why lisle leant against doorway and looked on very gravely doubtless he knew the fate that was in store him he remained at his post the best part of an hour and had any one taken the trouble to watch him they would have noticed that his eyes followed helen and jim quentin more closely than any other couple they stopped beside him once she said i did not know that you were coming mr lisle neither did i till quite late in the afternoon i suppose there is not the slightest use in my asking dance now if the young lady had been an experienced campaigner and had wished to dance with the gentleman which she did she would have artlessly replied oh yes i think i can give you number so and so mentally throwing over some less popular partner but helen looked straight into his face with grave truthful eyes displayed crowded programme and shook her head jim quentin who was evidently impatie nt at this delay placed his arm round his partner waist and danced her away to the melting strains of the old kate kearney waltz none gave themselves more thoroughly up to the pleasures of the moment or with more abandon than malone and creery they ﬂoated round and round and to and fro with buoyancy creery though elderly and stout was light of foot and capital dancer and her partner whirled her hither and thither like big red feather every one danced and the seventeen revolving couples made quite respectable appearance in the narrow room and what sight to behold the partnerless men languishing in doorways and clamouring halves and quarters of dances men who from the wicked perversity of their nature were they one man to ten girls would certainly decline to dance at all lisle had abandoned his station at last and waltzed repeatedly with durand they seem ed to know each other intimately and were by far the best waltzers in the room there was ﬁnish and ease about their performance that spoke of balls in the great babylon and though others might pause breath and pant and puf f these two like the brook seemed to go on ever they also put very liberal interpretation upon the term sitting out they walked up the hill in the moonlight and surveyed the other dancers did the not always with the same companion to be brief people were beginning to talk of the marked attention that lisle was paying not lost on helen who noticed them it were against her will and tried to keep down storm of angry thoughts in her heart by asking herself she paced the verandah with parkes and dropped haphazard sentences was it possible that she was jealous bitterly jealous because lisle spoke to another woman lisle who avoided her lisle who had history mr lisle who was going away pg 137 pg 138 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https held her head rather higher than usual pressed her lips very ﬁrmly together and told herself she had not yet fallen quite so low lisle and his friends were nothing to her supper was served early creery was the hostess and we know that she had nip in her mind when she suggested that at twelve they should adjourn refreshment and sailed in at the head of the procession on the general arm nip who had been the ﬁrst to enter the supper sat close to his doating mistress devouring of cold roast peacock and pâté foie gras with evident relish this was part of the entertainment that he could comprehend his mistress was also pleased with the refection and condescended to pass handsome encomium upon the and priced several of the dishes set before her with an eye to future entertainments of her own she was in capital spirits and imparted to malone who sat upon her left that she had never seen better ball in ross in all her experience also amongst many other remarks that miss caggett dress was like dancer but is not that it ought to be he inquired with assumed innocence i mean columbine she replied sternly and her face is an inch deep in is show to helen yes creery to miss denis i greatly disappointed in her she is beauty after all ah well maybe she will come to that so long she can stand the daylight there is hope creery told malone that she believed he was in love with the girl or he would not talk such nonsense and ﬁnally wound up the conversation by darkly insinuating something terrible about lisle adding that he had craved her forbearance and implored her to hold her tongue but i wo she concluded rising she spoke and dusting the crumbs off her ample lap it is my duty to expose him we want any wolves in sheep clothing prowling about the settlement and with nod weighty with warning she moved away in the direction of the miss caggett had torn her dress columbine helen was not sorry to be called aside to render assistance she was unutterably weary of quentin and his monotonous compliments his manner of protecting and appropriating her if she belonged to him and they had some secret bond of union was simply maddenin g she tacked up lizzie rents in corner of the lizzie said suddenly i suppose you have heard all the fuss about lisle creery is bubbling over with the news pretend i told you but she has heard all about him at last very much at last giggling yes interrogated her companion he was in the always suspected that he looked if he had been drilled he was turned out cashiered something disgraceful about racing and to his ﬂirtations we can imagine them from the way he is behaving himself he has danced every dance with durand though i will say this she asked him and of course it was because she came back that he changed his mind about the ball now your dress will i think said helen rising from her knees with rather choking sensation in her throat oh thanks awfully you dear girl pirouetting she spoke i much you another time there dance beginning and i must go and she hurried of in the doorway helen came face to face with lisle who was apparently searching some her pg 139 pg 140 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https held up her chin and with one cool glance was about to pass by when he said rather eagerly miss denis i was looking you malone has been sent to barracks and he said that i might ask you to give his last helen fully intended to decline the pleasure but something in lisle face compelled her to say yes and without word more she placed her hand upon his arm they walked into the and immedia tely commenced to waltz this waltz was soldate lieder her present partner was very superior to jim quentin and she found that she could go on much longer with him without stopping keeping up one even delightful pace but at last she was obliged to lean against the out of breath her eyes she did so followed durand enviously and she exclaimed i wish i could dance like her now had she breathed this aspiration to quentin or malone they would have assured her that her dancing was already perfection but lisle frankly replied oh all you want is practice you must remember that she has been at it years we used to dance together at children parties wo say how long ago i know i dance badly said helen colouring but the reason of that is that although i danced great deal at school it was always gentleman because i was tall ah i see and he laughed now i understand why you were so bent on steering about just now well you are not likely to dance gentleman again i fancy there regretfully it over shall we go outside helen nodded her head and accordingly they went down the steps arm in arm she meant to seize this opportunity of giving him hint of the mine on which he was standing word of warning with regard to creery she had accepted his friendship and surely this would be the act of friend in the dusky shades of secluded corner whispering to lizzie the pair descending from the pass down the steps and out into the moonlight and looked after them with an expression of annoyance that was quite revelation to his sprightly companion pg 141 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https xviii but what will papa say joy so seldom weaves chain like this that oh is pain to break its links so soon moor helen and her partner ascended the steep gravel pathway lined with palms gold mohur and and turning sharp corner came suddenly upon full view of the sea with the moon on her bosom it was soft still tropical night not sound broke the silence save distant murmur of human voices or the dip of an oar in the water that moon overhead seldom looked down upon fairer scene or more couple than the pair who were now leaning over the rustic railings and gazing at the prospect beneath rather the man was looking at the girl and the girl was looking at the sea doubtless idealizes the human form just it casts glamour over the landscape but at the present moment helen appears almost beautiful her namesake her lovely eyes have fathomless expression her pure clear proﬁle is thrown into admirable relief by the glossy dark leaves of neighbouring in her simple muslin dress with its soft lace rufﬂes and row of pearls round her throat she seemed the very type of modest english maiden painted columbine this and perhaps little out of place amid her eastern surroundings she continued to gaze straight before her with her hands crossed on the top of the railing and her eyes ﬁxed on the sea she gazed boat shot out of the dim shadows and across the white moonlit track then passed into obscurity again thinking usual miss denis said her companion yes she answered rather reluctantly thinking of something that i must say to you and wondering how i am to say it is it much worse than last time he inquired with smile but there was an inﬂection of eagerness in his voice oh quite dif ferent ah she is going to announce that she is engaged to quentin he said to hims elf with sharp twinge you ﬁnd it so very hard to tell he inquired in studiously indif ferent tone yes very hard but i must i owe you much am wish to warn you suddenly sinking her voice to whisper she added creery has had letter about you containing any startling revelations any bad news yes she returned faintly bad news oh mr lisle am so sorry is the news too terrible to be repeated he asked with marked deliberation helen ﬁdgeted with her fan picked bit of bark off the railing in front of her and after long silence and without raising her eyes she said must i tell you if you please rather stifﬂy that you have been in the army yes so i was not aware that it was criminal to hold her majesty commission but of course creery knows best pg 142 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https she says you obliged leave disgraced continued his companion in rapid broken whisper cashiered you mean of course yes glancing at him nervously to her amazement he was smiling you believe this miss denis he asked raising himself suddenly from leaning posture and looking at her steadily she faltered i think not more audibly i not blushing deeply she spoke why he asked rather anxiously i can not give you any reason she stammered somewhat abashed by the steadfastness of his gaze except woman reason that it is i am sincerely grateful to you miss denis your conﬁdence is not am not the man in question creery has got hold of the wrong end of the stick once i know of whom she is thinking his face darkened he spoke namesake and i am ashamed to say relation of mine it is extremely of the old lady to make the subject of her correspondence then in quite another tone he said i suppose you have heard of our start yes she replied scarcely above whisper i regular bird of passage and ought to have been away weeks ago and you yourself will probably be on the wing before long he was thinking of her marriage with jim quentin but how could she know that oh not year at any rate papa does not expect that we shall be moved before then she answered quite composedly i am sorry you are going to the mean you and quentin hastily correcting herself it horribly unhealthy and convicts die there by dozens her lip quivered little she spoke not quite so bad you think returned her companion moving his elbow an inch closer to her i an old traveller you know i will look after him you look after who she asked in amazement why quentin to be sure i know all about it i lowering his voice am in the secret lisle will you kindly tell at once what you mean certainly miss denis i mean that quentin is the happiest of men i am extremely pleased to hear it but why she interrogated ﬁrmly what is the use of fencing with in this way he exclaimed with gesture of impatience you may trust know all about it quentin has told himself that he is engaged to you engaged to she echoed with glowing eyes mr lisle you are joking i look if i was joking he demanded rather bitterly it is not the case it is the ﬁrst that i have heard of it exclaimed the young lady in voice trembling with agitation and indignation how dared he say so lisle felt bewildered rapturous possibility made his brain reel yet who was he to believe quentin had been very positive he had never known him to utter deliberate lie and here on the other hand stood this girl saying and if ever the truth was traced upon proud indignant lips it was written on hers you believe mr lisle she asked impatiently fully moment he did not speak and was it the moonlight or some sudden emotion that made him look so white pg 143 pg 144 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https i believe you of course he answer ed in low voice and now he continued in the same low tone urged to speak by an irresistible impulse perhaps you can guess why i have stayed away how from sense of mistaken loyalty my lips have been locked her eyes which up to this had been ﬁxed intently on his now sank suddenly suspicion of the truth now dawned upon her mind and she turned aside her face miss denis he said i see you have guessed my love you these three magic words were almost inaudible barely louder than the orange leaves which whispered in the scented air nevertheless busy little zephyr caught them up carried them away and murmured them to the sleepy ﬂowers and the drowsy waves that washed the invulnerable rocks beneath them helen made reply this was the ﬁrst to which she had ever listened and those three syllables stirred every ﬁbre of her heart you remember that time on the wreck he continued when you told that i was leading lazy useless life and that i ought to go back to the outer world you little guessed that it was you yourself who were keeping prisoner here still the young lady said nothing but kept her face steadily turned towards the sea he waited moment if expecting some reply but none came at last he said in quite different tone i see how it have been presumptuous idiot and after all i had right to expect that you would care straw about i am years older than you are i lisle she interrupted turning towards him at last and speaking with apparent effort you are quite she stopped and little smile played round her mouth she added almost under her breath but what will papa say then you mean to say he exclaimed coming nearer to her and grasping the railing ﬁrmly in his hand to conceal how it shook again she made reply but this time mr lisle undoubtedly took silence consent creery and parkes were standing on the very summit of the hill overlooking everything and everybody and the former had not failed to notice couple at some distance below them leaning over the rails and contemplating the sea tall girl in white helen denis of course and who was the man it looked like captain duran there captain durand had just bent over her and kissed her hand pretty doings certainly married man there she exclaimed suddenly nudging dr parkes did you see that see what my dear madam that man down there with helen denis i believe it captain durand he has just kissed her hand oh wait till i see his wife pooh returned her companion contemptuously the moonlight must have deceived you it was his own hand he was stroking his moustache oh well i not so sure of that i suppose i must take your word it doctor meanwhile to return to lisle who had kissed helen hand creery eyes seldom deceived her w you say something to helen he pleaded anxiously yes turning round and drawing her ﬁngers away i go to the nicobars but i must i have promised quentin and hall and i can not break my word i would gladly give half i possess to get out of it but i little guessed this afternoon when quentin asked to go and i said that i would so soon have such very strong reasons saying pg 145 pg 146 project gutenberg ebook of bird of

wistfully and yet i should not say so that night of the storm when you ran down the pier steps and called back your voice and your face haunted afterwards days i had kind of conviction that i had met my fate and so i had you see by the way i wonder why you like helen or what you see in the young lady smiled but said nothing all the world can understand my caring you but i am in one way an utter stranger you could not answer single question about if you were asked far appearances go i am an idler mere without friends station or money if you are idle you will have to amend your and work you well myself he interrupted with laugh to friends i would say you could share mine but then i have so few still better or worse you will be gilbert lisle day faltered the young lady i know i am not half fascinating nor quarter quentin honestly what you see in helen you expect to pander to your conceit and to make you pretty speeches she asked with rather saucy smile indeed i not all the pretty speeches of course should come from i only want to hear the truth he returned looking at her with his steady dark eyes well then since you must know and you seem generally to have your own way i will

steamer become smaller and smaller till it vanished altogether and helen she turned her face away from the sea at last had suspicion of tears in her eyes which her companions attributed to quentin she walked down the hill with home that little lady who was leaning on her pressed her arm in token of sympathy and whispered in signiﬁcant tone he will come back dear so he will agreed helen also in

testimony she would lay her hand upon her pocket with dramatic gesture and say that nonsense i got it all here in black and white i always knew that there was screw loose about that man perhaps you will all be guided by another time i an excellent judge of character my sister lady grubb declares she always says can not go far wrong if you listen to pointing to her breast bone with plump foreﬁnger then she would produce the billet and after much clearing of throat commence to read what she already knew by heart ask if i can tell you anything about lisle mysterious person who has lately come to the andamans very dark age over thirty slight in ﬁgure shabby and idle close about himself and with curious deliberate way of speaking supposed to have been in the army and to have come from bengal christian name unknown initial letter it sounded exactly like description in police notice dear creery i know him well and he may well be close about himself and his affairs it was creery cue to pause and smack her lips with unction he is the person you so accurately describe he is captain lisle black sheep who was turned out of regiment in bengal on account of some very shady transactio ns on the turf he told himself he was fond of riding creery would supplement if this fact clenched the business was bankrupt and had fearful notoriety in every way woman who respected herself would be seen speaking to him the andamans doubt suit him very well at present and offer him new ﬁeld his energies and harbour of refuge at the same time not let any one cash cheque him and warn all the young ladies in the settlement that he is married man there creery would conclude with toss of her topee what you think of that lisle is not here to speak himself ventured helen on one occas ion les absents ont toujours it was new to see helen adopt an insurrectionary attitude creery stared f and nonsense angrily and let tell you helen denis that it is not at all maidenly or modest young girl like you to be taking up the cudgels notorious reprobate like this lisle i sure he is not reprobate and i certain you are mistaken rejoined helen bravely here the elder lady ﬂamed out and thumped her umbrella violently on the ground and cried in her highest key then why did he go away he knew that i had heard about him i told him so to his face i never say behind person back what i wo say to their face oh creery mrs creery and it is very remarkab le coincidence that in less than twelve hours he was out of the place how you account that eh she paused breath and once more proceeded triumphantly pg 161 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https he will never show here again believe and after all i am thankful to say he has done great harm far i know he ran bills

him creery always will deeds are better than words have you gotten the wreck forgotten it she screamed am i ever likely to get it out of my head only my calling myself hoarse you and lisle would both have been murdered in that hole of cabin you know i told you not to go down and you would and see what you got by it there was not the slightest use in arguing with this lady who not only imposed upon others but also upon herself she had distorted mind that idealized everything connected with her own actions and deprecated and belittled the deeds of other people the only persons who had not heard the horrible tale about lisle were the durands and the general the latter was singular ly astute gentleman and never lost certain habit of cool military promptitude even when in retreat each time creery had exhibited symptoms of extracting letter from her pocket he had escaped the durands were lisle friends fact that lowered them many fathoms in creery estimation and were consequently the very last to hear of the scandal about fortnight after the departure of the scotia the general gave one of his usual large dinner every one in ross was invited and about sat down to the table when the meal was over and the ladies had pulled few crackers and sipped their glass of claret they all ﬁled off into the in answer to creery rather dramatic signal and there they looked over photographs noted the alterations in each other dresses drank coffee and conversed in groups in due time the conversation turned upon that ever fertile topic lisle and graham who was seated beside durand little knowing what she was doing ﬁred the ﬁrst shot by regretting very much that lisle had turned out to be such dreadful character so utterly different from what he seemed encouraged by one or two questions from her neighbour she unfolded the whole story meantime durand sat and listened in rigid silence her lips pressed ﬁrmly together her hands tightly locked in her satin lap when the recital had come to an end she turned her grave eyes on her companion and said in her most impressive manner how you know this oh it well known it all over the place creery had letter glancing over to where that lady reclined in comfortable chair with serene expression on her face and diadem creery said durand raising her voice which was singularly clear and penetrating pray what is this story that you have been telling every one about mr lisle this warlike invocation awoke the good lady from her doze and like steed she lifted her head and it were snif fed the conﬂict from afar i been telling nothing but the truth durand herself at once to an upright and you are most welcome to hear it though he is friend of yours and she tossed her diadem much to say come on thank you then will you be so very kind to repeat what you have heard returned durand with freezing politenes s that made the other ladies look at each other signiﬁcantly there was going to be ﬁght and they felt thrill of mingled delight and apprehension at the prospect bold durand was the only woman in the island who had never veiled her crest to creery she was now about to challenge her to single they all saw it in her face pg 162 pg

lance in rest people who have nothing to hide are never ashamed to speak of their concerns but one ever got word out of lisle and i am sure he recei ved every encouragement to be open he was in the army he admitted that against his will and that was all he never deceived knew he was without any resources he was out at elbows i pray spare us your opinion and tell us what facts you have to go upon interrupted durand calmly cutting short this ﬂow of denunciation i have letter from friend at simla unconsciously seeking her pocket letter she retorted proudly which you can read saying that he was cashiered conduct unbecoming an ofﬁcer and gentlema n that he is bankrupt and swindler and married man if this last enormity crowned all it is not word of it replied durand coolly if she were merely saying how you not true nonsense is he not dark aged over thirty name lisle did he not hang about the settlement six months living on his wits of course it is true rejoined the elder lady with an air that proclaimed that she had not merely crushed but pulverized her foe lisle is not an uncommon name and i know that my friend is not the original of your ﬂattering little sketch but i tell you that he is i can prove it i have it all in black and white cried creery temper had now gone by the board who was this durand that she should dare to contradict her she saw that they were face to face in the lists and that the other ladies were eager spectators of the tourney it was not merely dispute over lisle it was struggle the social throne whoever conquered now would be mistress of the realm this woman must be browbeaten silenced and ﬁguratively slain i have it all in writing and pray what can you bring against that she demanded imperiously simply my word which i hope will stand good

ceiling with derisive laugh and an adequate expression of incredulity i am not specially addressing myself to you creery exclaimed durand at white heat but still retaining wonderfu l command of her

siberia and central america the andamans were novelty he came few weeks and stayed few months because he liked the ﬁshing and boating and the unconventional life and who is the other lisle some distant connection i believe every family has its black sheep why did he not let us know his position gasped creery because he thinks it of so little importance he wished i conclude to stand on his own merits and to be valued himself alone he found his proper level here did he not creery he lived in the palace of truth once and she laughed undoubtedly is fair play it was her turn now i must say that i wonder what he saw in the andamans exclaimed graham at last one attraction doubt was because he could go away whenever he liked another that he was left to one ran after him and durand laughed again in london he is made so much of every one knows he is wealthy and bachelor and that his eldest brother has only one lung besides all these advantages he is extremely popular and is beset by invitations to shoot to dance to dine to yacht from year end to year end well he got complete holiday from all that kind of thing here then she recollected that in castigating creery and miss caggett

port blair then at the nicobars then rangoon and so back to calcutta and the reason of quentin hurried departure was that the order to start the nicobars came in the steamer that was to take him there

stars the next morning the scotia was off the low long coast of the nicobars so low was it that it resembled forest standing in the water in the midst of this seeming forest there was narrow passage that casual eye might easily overlook passage just barely wide enough to admit the steamer with natural arch of rock on one side the water was clear emerald green and very deep and along the wooded shores of the entrance to camorta were many white native huts built on wooden piles scattered up and down the high banks clothed in jungle soon the passage widened into large inland bay lined with mangroves and jungles save clearing on the side where there was rude pier bazaar of native houses and some larger wooden buildings on the overhanging hill this was camorta the capital of the nicobars to which port blair was london to some small provincial town the natives were totally different to the andamanese they were malays with brown skins ﬂat heads and wide mouths and came swarming round

slept much possible and grumbled when awake at the food the climate and the heads of his department and was not nearly much to be pitied he imagined not half much lisle who neither read novels nor slept many hours at stretch or had agreeable anticipations of future ﬂirtations in he was remarkably silent and smoked many of the drowsy hours away when he did join in the conversation his remarks were so cynical and his words so sharply edged that quentin was positively in awe of him and was more than usually wary in the choice of his topics out of doors he shot the ugly greedy caymen caught turtle and sketched or explored the country recklessly making his way through the rank dank jungle where matted creepers hung from tree to tree and snakes and spotted vipers darted up their hideous

playing snatches of different things unable to settle down to any special song or piece she had felt curiously restless all the morning and was thinking that she would run over and have chat with home she was too idle to anything else sudden loud sob made her start up from the and turn round somewhat nervously there she beheld her ayah fatima staring at her through the purdah but the instant she was discovered she quickly dropped it and vanished it never occurred to helen to connect fatima tears with herself or her affairs it was more than probable that she had been having quarrel with her

curtain and took her father hand in hers but what was this this motionless form with closed eyes she had never seen it before in all her life but who does not recognize death even at their ﬁrst meeting oh he is dead she shrieked and fell insensible on the pathway long time she remained unconscious and it was best so people whispered there were so many sad arrangements to be made the general himself superintended everything with regard to the funeral which was to take place at sundown was the invariable custom in the east there there is gradual parting in england where dead lies amid the living days in india such hospitality is never shown to death he is thrust forth the very day he comes the wrench is agonizing and in case like the present where death was sudden the shock overwhelming to think that you may be laughing and talking with relative friend or neighbour one evening that they have been in the very best of health little anticipating the one great change

breakfast how little are we able to see into the future happily ourselves would colonel denis have carried home that big bunch of lilies with such alacrity had he known that they were destined to decorate his own cofﬁn in deference to helen who was now alive to every sound the large cortège almost stole from the door and the band was mute the cemetery was on aberdeen not far from the fatal

marvellous to the community that such pretty girl should be returning to england unmarried they shrugged their shoulders lifted their eyebrows and wondered to one another whether it was because she

order and all went well till about the third night out when the disturbance began at least it began far i was concerned i was knocked up about an hour after i had come off watch and out of my ﬁrst sleep by some one thundering at my door i thinking it was mistake swore bit and roared out that they were to go to the third ofﬁcer and the devil but instead of this the door was gently opened and the purser put in very long white face and said here waters i want you in my cabin there is the mischief to pay and i ca make it out i ca get wink of sleep the most awful groans you ever heard i sat up and looked at him hard he was always sober man he was sober now and he was not walking in his sleep after moment very natural hesitation i threw on some clothes and followed him to his cabin which was forward the light was still burning and his bunk turned back just he had leapt out of it but there was nothing to be seen bit he said eagerly on minute and listen i did i waited and listened with all my ears and i heard nothing but the thumping of the engines and the tramping of the ofﬁcer on watch overhead i was about to turn on my heel with rather an angry remark when he arrested with livid face and said it is and sure enough there it low deep hollow groan and mistake about it groan if wrung from some one in mortal agony some one suffering lingering and excruciating looked at the purser big beads of perspira tion were standing on his forehead and he looked hard at i heard it all last night he said in husky whisper i was afraid to speak i hunted high and low and sounded every hole and corner but there is nothing to be found then he ceased speaking there it was again louder more painful than ever it certainly came from some place below the ﬂoor and on the starboard side we both knelt down and hammered and knocked and called and laid our ears to the boards but it was of use was silence it was some one snoring i suggested it might be dog returned the purser who was still on his knees human voice and the groans of dying man sure i live one i remained in the cabin half an hour and though we overhauled the whole concern we heard nothing more so i fetched up my own bunk and turned in and went to sleep the next day the purser said he heard the moans very faintly if they were now getting weaker and weaker and after this entirely ceased good spell everything went along without hitch we had 1 weather and made runs but one evening in the twilight i noticed great commotion in the saloon i heard high woman voice one of the lady passengers was the centre of crowd and was making some angry complaint to the captain the young man in the boots again she said it really too bad why is he allowed in this part of the ship what are the stewards about it is insuf ferable to be persecuted in this manner every evening at this hour he comes to the door of the saloon and beckons to or to any one who is near but he never seems to catch any one eyes but mine it really disgraceful that the steerage passengers should be allowed among us in this way the saloon stewards were all called up and rigidly by the captain but they all most positively declared that stranger had been seen by them nor was there any steerage passenger on board that at all answered the lady description course that nonsense she exclai med indignantly comes to the bar spirits on the very sly he i gone to

captain orders but the head steward privately informed with grin there was such person tall young man in blue jumper with long boots on the ship books and we both came to the conclusion that the lady was decidedly wanting in her top gear however after while other people began to see the steerage passenger not merely ladies only but practical elderly men and very disagreeable whispers began to get aﬂoat that ship was haunted the apparition in long butcher boots could never be caught or traced but he was visible repeatedly and did not merel y conﬁne himself to hanging about and beckonin g at the

idea of taking away the lights at eleven there was uproar and an open mutiny among the ladies passengers were completely unmanageable the women going about in gangs and the very crew in couples the captain endeavoured to make bold stand against the ghost but he was silenced by clamour of voices and by cloud of witnesses who had all seen it and to make matters better we came in the most awful weather i ever experienced our hatches were stove in our decks swept and i never was more thankful in all my life than when we took up our pilot in the downs what between the ghost and the gales even

over our time having lost three boats and gained the agreeable reputation of being haunted ship when we were getting out the cargo and having the usual overhaul below i happened to be on duty one day when i was accosted by the boatswain who came aft to where i was standing with an uncommonly grave face sir said he found something we did not bargain it was in the place where the anchor is and now the chain being all paid out it empty you he paused moment but dead man of course i hurried forward at once and looked down into dark hole when by the light of bit of candle held by one of the crew i saw sure enough crushed up against one side the skeleton of skeleton the rats had picked his bones clean his coat still hung on him he wore long digger boots and digger hat covered his bare skull i started back and fell foul of the candle though i not particularly nervous person i now remembered the groans i had heard in the purser cabin see sir how it was said the boatswain was stowaway in course when we were in dock this place was empty cause why the anchor is out and it seemed to this poor ignorant wretch who was seaman anyway to be just the very it were made him i kind of

on the trees and sink down to beggary or to working their way home before the mast ay he thought to get cast back said the he just walked straight into the jaws of death the moment we began to weigh anchor and the chain came reeling and reeling into his it had outlet but the hole at the top and the rattle of it and the noise of the drowned his cries he was just walled in poor chap and buried up alive of course we all knew that this was the mysterious apparition in long boots who had created such an unparalleled disturbance on the passage home presently the remains were decently carried away and there was an inquest but nothing could be discovered about the body we subscribed the funeral among us and he was buried in the nearest we sailors are superstitious lot and though we got out of it

strict injunctions to keep up the ﬁre and to see that tea was ready to the moment of ﬁve sometimes they gave at homes the preparations which were left to helen who work ed like slavey these at homes were chieﬂy remarkable profusion of ﬂowers weak tea weaker music and crush next to the cook helen was decidedly the most useful member of the household she was kept fully occupied all day long and in constant employment was her only escape from her own thoughts she was not happy nay many night she cried herself to sleep her aunt was cool and distant though she had displeased her in some way but to helen knowledge she had given her cause of offence since the terrible incident of the cup years and years previously her cousins were sharp critical and patronizing and evidently considered that she occupied very much lower social status than themselves she was unwelcome an interloper and felt it keenly more than once she tried to screw up her courage and ask her aunt what was to be her future undoubtedly she was not to remain on permanently an inmate of 15 cream big box still stood in the back hall somehow she rarely had chance of few words with her aunt alone her affairs were never once touched upon in her hearing and yet she had reason to believe that certain animated and rather shrill conversations that she frequently interrupted and that fell away into an awkward silence she entered room about her and her future destination visitors came rapping at 15 cream street every afternoon and two out of the dozens who had called asked miss denis few days after her arrival she had been in the with her cousins carrie and clara when her ﬁrst caller made her appearance the was an apartment that seemed to be all mirrors low chairs small tables and plush photo pretty room entirely got up show not use several of the chairs were not to be trusted and one or two tables were decidedly dangerous but the tout ensemble through coloured blinds was everything that was smart and fashionable and good style fetish the miss platts worshipped on this particular afternoon carrie was yawning over the ﬁre clara was looking out of the window commenting on coroneted carriage and superb pair of steppers with what is called extravagant action which had just stopped opposite mentally she was thinking how much she would like to see this equipage in waiting at their own door when very curious came lumbering along and actually drew up at shapeless weather yellow brougham drawn by fat and driven by coachman in keeping with his man with long beard rusty hat that an andamanese would have scorned and round his knees little did helen denis dream that she was gazing at that grubb carriage good gracious carrie who on earth is this cried clara turning to her sister who was now staring exhaustingly at her own reﬂection in the and coming to call here oh mercy sake come and look pg 211 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https door of the brougham was slowly opened and very stout old lady attired in long black satin cloak and gorgeous bonnet with nodding plumes descended and waddled up the steps in the vacant carriage there still remained two fat pugs worked cushion pile of books and what certainly looked like basket of vegetables it one we know said clara contemptuously it may be friend of plunket or mistake apparently it was neither at this moment the door was ﬂung open and lady grubb was announced very eagerly she advanced to clara with round smiling face and outstretched hands saying so glad to ﬁnd you at home my sister told to be sure and call and i was at the stores she paused and faltered literally cowed by the expression of miss platt platt who drew back elongated her neck and looked insolent interrogation i think you have been so good to come and see murmured helen hastily advancing to the rescue y are creery sister yes and of course you are miss denis seizing her outstretched hand if it were belt poor lady grubb was completely thrown off her balance by the stern demeanour of the other damsel helen led her to sofa and tried to engage her in friendly conversation but it was not easy to converse with her two cousins sitting rigidly by if they were on board of examination and not suffering word or look to escape them they sat and gazed at lady grubb in quite combined and systematic manner to them she was such unique object and such utterly awful style she like her sister was endowed with copious ﬂow of language but the very fountain of her speech was frozen by these two ice maidens the ﬁrst few words she did manage to utter were hurried and incoherent but presently she found courage to inquire after maria and nip and creery horrible to relate she called him creery and also after many people she had heard about at port blair it was very plain to helen that maria had painted her island home with an unsparing supply of gorgeous colours and lady grubb looked upon her absent relative position something between that of the queen of sheba and the princess badoura without doubt she then murmured few words of really kind condolence to helen and if she had taken her departure at this point all would have been well but she was now becoming habituated to the stony stare of the misses platt and felt more emboldened to converse some malicious elf put it into her head to say with meaning smile i am quite up in all the port blair news and port blair secrets you know i heard great deal about certain gentleman helen became what is known all colours and her two cousins all ears to them she had positively denied that she had left the ghost of an admirer to lament her departure from the andaman islands oh you know who i mean i can see continued the old lady playfully she had any number of offers addressing herself rather triumphantly to the miss platts but quentin is to be the happy man and here the wretched old woman actually winked at clara and caroline indeed indeed lady grubb you are quite mistaken cried helen hastily quentin is nothing to but mere acquaintan ce and to anything else was joking oh well well we wo say word about it now but you must come and spend long day with

and now i must really be going standing up she spoke i suppose scully is waiting presumably the uncouth coachman the miss platts did not ring the bell neither did they deign to rise from their chairs but merely closed their eyes at their visitor she made kind of shy intended curtsey and wishing them good afternoon departed with considerable precipitation helen went downstairs and conducted lady grubb to the and presently saw her bowled away in her yellow chariot with brace of pugs in her lap she was not very distinguished person certainly but she meant to be friendly to be kind and little of these commodities went long way with her now she blushed when she recalled her cousins deportment surely an andamanese female in her own premises were they hole or tree would have shown more civility to stranger she entered the the miss platts exclaimed in one breath what creature who is she she looks like an old cook supplemented carrie i was trembling lest any of our friends should come in her name is grubb she is sister to creery how could she give any approximate idea of that lady pomp the principal lady at the andamans she added rather faintly principal lady what rubbish cried clara if she resembles her distinguished sister i make you my compliments the french say on the class of society you enjoyed out there let us see where she lives where her card what is her name said carrie here it is taking it up between two supercilious ﬁngers and reading lady grubb smithson v illas pimlico pimlico so i should have imagined of course any one who lived in that region was in the miss platts opinion socially extinct you certainly can not yourself the pleasure of spending long and happy day at smithson villas said carrie with decision goodness knows whom you might meet and she would be bragging to her cronies that you were our cousin i shall go if she asks replied helen quietly it is matter who i meet and i will guarantee that your name does not transpire was the girl trying to be sarcastic carrie looked at her sharply but helen face was immovable well i most devoutly trust that she will not see ﬁt to wait upon you again or that if she does she will come in the i wonder what the thought of her i sure i saw evelyn at the window remarked clara oh she added with great animation here is the jenkins and her mother what mercy that they did not come ﬁve minutes ago now ensued general arranging of hair of chairs and of blinds evidently the jenkins were people worth cultivating and indisputably of good style fly away helen at once cried carrie and tell price to bring up tea

garment at port blair and even passed muster best on board ship but which stamped her at once in the eyes of the miss platts bad style her boys too so eager was she to see helen were not yet equipped in their new suits and were anomalous spectacles in highland kilts and sailor hats clara and carrie did not condescend to appear on this occasion they saw amply sufﬁcient of home and family over the blind helen felt sense of burning humiliation and shame to think that now when she was at home among her own people they would not even take the trouble to come upstairs and thank home her great kindness to her nor even so much send her cup of tea she hoped in her heart that her friend would think they were out but they went audibly up and down stairs and laughed and shut doors and home was neither deaf nor stupid she stayed an hour and helen enjoyed her visit greatly despite her disappointment at the of her relations or failin g them the it was one little oasis in the desert of her now dreary life they conv ersed eagerly together and talked the shibboleth of people who have the same friends in the same country they kissed and cried little and parted with mutual promises of many letters home was going to jersey and thence to the continent your friends are not our friends and our friends are not your friends said carrie forcibly and helen felt that indeed far appearance went her visitors had not been success and her own part never dreamt of being admitted within the sacred circle of her cousins acquaintance now and then she met people accidentally in the hall or in the street when walking with her cousins and once she overheard carrie saying to clara apropos of visitors of course there is occasion to introduce helen to any one and this amiable injunction was obeyed to the letter however the omission sat very lightly on the once admired of all admirers at port blair one morning it happened that helen was in the when bosom friend of carrie came to miss fowler sharpe fashionable acquaintance whom the misses platt toadied she had the entrée to circles barred to them and they hoped to use her pass key they made great deal of the lady ﬂattered her caressed her and ran after her all of which was agreeable to miss sharpe she was very elegantly dressed london girl who spoke with drawl and gave one the idea that her eyelids were too heavy her eyes she had come

muslin and coloured bows on the backs of some of the chairs where she was discovered by her cousins and their friend to whom she was presented in hasty manner which plainly said you need not notice her miss sharpe stared second vouchsafed her little nod then sat down with her back to helen and speedily got her existence the three friends were soon deep in conversation whilst she worked steadily on kneeling at the chair she was dressing with her face turned away from the company their principal topics were dress and weddings weddings and dress and who was ﬂirting with whom and what was likely to be match and what was not and who looked lovely in such gown and what men were in town at length helen who had not been attending caught one syllable that made her start and pause and then listen with heightened colour and beating heart yes i hear that gilbert lisle is actually coming back he has been away amon g savages this last time positively fraternizing with cannibals gilbert lisle coming home cried carrie then kate calderwood will be happy at last i suppose it will be all arranged this season yes his father is most anxious that he should settle indeed i believe he wrote him out furious letter and said that if he did not come home without delay he would marry again himself at this threat all three ladies laughed immoderately imagine any sane woman marrying such an old turk lord lingard drawled miss sharpe he is seventy if he is day bald and beaky and with temper that has european notoriety the very idea of his supposing that he would get any one to take him yes hideous old creature chimed in clara he always reminds of white cockatoo with pink bill nevertheless any one of these young ladies would have said yes with pleasure had lord lingard asked them to be his i can not imagine how any one ever married him originally pursued miss sharpe and yet they say that lady lingard was one of the handsomest women of her day oh but put in clara delighted to impart this class of information you know they say that she married him out of pique and she did not live long i suppose he worried her into her grave rejoined miss sharpe though he may have helped to kill her she died of consumption did she and her eldest son is following her he is in rapid decline added carrie and you say that gilbert lisle is really coming home suddenly falling back on the original topic so i told mother is going to send him card our dance but i never believe in him till i see him how i wish we knew him ejaculated clara looking at her visitor wistfully oh you know he is not society man only goes to few houses and some country places where there is good shooting now and then you see him at ball or in squash in some staircase but he has very fair idea of his own value and never makes himself cheap and miss sharpe smiled rather disagreeably that the way with all these rich bachelors exclaimed carrie they are so spoilt and so abominably conceited i wonder how he got on among the savages said miss sharpe pg 218 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https did she guess that the girl who was sitting in the background with bent head and burning face could have answered her question then and there i wonder if it will come off with katie after all exclaimed carrie she is the girl he used to ride with in the park last year is she not freckled with high shoulders she comes to our church i wonder what he sees in her she added it is his father my dear who sees everything in her her property they call it with the lingard estates and so she is to be gilbert lisle i believe so and with this remark the subject dropped helen had listened to this conversa tion with crimson face and throbbi ng heart everything was accounted now he had been simply amusing himself with her this man who was accustomed to be made much of by london beauties who was eagerly sought by house parties in country it likely that he would be really serious in making love to an obscure girl like herself girl whom he had come across in his wanderings among savage islands she told herself not at all likely his actions spoke him he had been simply seeing how much she would believe repeating rôle that he had doubtless played dozens of times previously and during his wanderings his wealthy destined bride miss calderwood was all the time awaiting him in england she was to be gilbert lisle i declare you have stitched that on the wrong side out what can you have been thinking of demanded clara very sharply when her fashionable friend had departed you will have to rip it and put it on properly your wits must have been gathering if clara had known where her cousin thoughts had been she would have been very much surprised once in her life and ejaculated her favourite exclamation fancy just fancy with unusual animation the day after this visit helen was asked to accompany her cousin carrie on foot to bond street not an unusual honour she was useful carrying small parcels true her mourning was shabby but none of the platts acquaintances knew who she was and if the worst came to the worst she might pass superior on their way back from the shops carrie took it into her head to take turn in the park it was about twelve and the row was gay with fashionable throng of pedestrians carrie met several friends to whom she gave bow here and nod there and helen to her great amazement recognized one while yet afar off and although garbed in frock coat and tall she actually beheld quentin coming towards her walking with very woman and followed by two red dachshunds she was positive that the recognition was mutual and was pleased in her present barren life to hail any acquaintance from port him when they came almost face to face she bowed and smiled and would have stopped but he merely glanced at her if she were some most casual acquaintance swept off his hat and passed on evidently port blair and rotten row were two very dif ferent places ﬂood of scarlet rushed over her face which her companion did not fail to notice and who is that gentleman quentin i knew him at port blair fancy i have heard of him he is quite in society he is friend of the sharpes i believe he is rather frightfully in debt helen made reply but walked on in silence and miss platt put two and two together with much satisfaction to herself hele n undoubted confusion

useful working shopping going messages her aunt admitted to herself that she was quite good another servant in the house though she did not actually use the word servant even in her thoughts she was handy useful industrious girl and did not put herself forward so the matter of getting her situati on had been allowed to remain somewhat in abeyance helen knew that she must eventually move on but had nervous dread of broaching the subject to her relations day after day she failed to bring her courage to the point but the question ever trembling on her lips at last found utterance and ﬁnding herself alone with platt one morning she said have you made any plans about aunt julia yes my dear was the surprisingly prompt answer it is all quite settled i had intended speaking to you before but something put it out of my head i have an importan t letter to write just now but when the girls go out this evening you and i will have talk together in due time the miss platts departed in the brougham bound little dinner and the play helen who had assisted to adorn them partook of meat tea with her aunt and then they both adjourned to the little den upon the stairs there by the light of lamp platt read the day news and helen sewed and very long time and needless to say she was most impatient to learn her fate her aunt was lady who never worked and rarely opened book but devoted her whole time to writing talking organizing eating sleeping and dressing she perused the paper daily duty just to see what was going on and after she had now read every word of it including advertisements she folded it up with crackling noise and said rather suddenly this is capital opportunity us to have nice little chat i have been intending to speak to you some time of course you know dear that your father left his affairs in terrible state i was not the least surpris ed to hear it and all that can be scraped together you is fourteen pounds than wages shrugging her shoulders there is use in saying anything about the dead what is done is done nor that to satisfy his ridiculous ideas of honour he left his only use aunt julia i would not listen to you interrupted helen with sudden ﬁre platt was astounded this outbreak recalled old days she positively recoil ed before the expression of her niece eyes the imperious gesture of her hand she leant back in her chair with folded arms and sat some moments in indignant silence when she reached out two ﬁngers and pulled the down so that her face was completely in the shadow she had reason to so she was going to say things of which she might unquestionably be ashamed and once more she commenced if repeating something she had previously rehearsed ours is the oddest family we have so few relations on the denis side nice

takes an interest and unfortunately she takes interest in you she has got it into her head that you are worldly helen stared round the to see if her aunt was joking it quite true responded platt meeting her gaze and once she gets an idea into her head it stays so it is rather unfortunate but at any rate all her thoughts are at present centred on mission to the laps then with perceptible pause

country or at the seaside we would have margin but the girls would not hear of living anywhere but in naturally i have to study them and their interests of course aunt julia acquiesced her listener

live in the best part of it and here we are then we require to keep up certain style to correspond with the is indispensable and carriage the horses of course are jobbed again we have to entertain to go to the seaside to this last even with plunket making half the things costs small fortune the long and the short of it is that out of my very tolerable income i never have single sixpence at the end

not lose his presence of mind and said in his most airy manner oh really then on another occasion i may hope to be more the holidays perhaps glancing interrogatively at clara platt who returned his

before certain popular picture at the royal academy but so far his view had been entirely obscured by the broad back of gentleman in front of him it vaguely occurred to him that there was something rather familiar in the shape of those broad shoulders when their owner suddenly turned round and he found himself face to face with james quentin by jove old fellow exclaimed the latter shaking his hand vigorously this is pleasant surprise and so you have returned from your you hail from last only new york i arrived two days ago and feel if i had been away ten years i so out of everything and behind the times second rip van winkle then i suppose you have not heard my little bit of news i fancy i can guess it it not very difﬁcult are married right you are second daniel come away and speak to she will be delighted to see you gilbert had not bargained would much rather never meet helen denis again however there was resisting apollo summons and in another moment he was standing before velvet settee and ere he was aware of it his companion was saying jane my love let present an old lisle mrs quentin he glanced down and saw dame over whose head fully forty summers had ﬂown she was smiling up at him most graciously and holding out lady was indisputably where was helen denis her new acquaintance made gallant struggle to master his amazement and to utter few bald commonplace remarks about the heat and the pictures and presently suffered himself to be borne onward by the crow but jim quentin was not going to lose sight of him thus he had married wife considerably beneath him in birth and it behoved him to keep fast hold of his friends and secure footing on the social ladder lisle was popular man he had discovered this fact on his return to england and had made considerable capital out of his name in various ways it had proved to be an open sesame to rather exclusive circle who cordially welcomed apollo when they heard that he and gilbert lisle were like brothers and had lived under the same roof months lisle had been useful at port blair and he would be useful in london well were you surprised to ﬁnd that there was mrs quentin he asked he came up with his quarry in comparatively empty room chieﬂy devoted to the display of etchings on lar ge stands and easels of course looking him steadily in the face she is not the lady i expected to see what then all of sudden he remembered who had been completely swept out of his mind by twelvemont h of busy intrigues and such exciting pursuits and oh to be sure you were thinking of miss denis but that did not come off you see he added with careless effront ery she was all very pour passer le temps an ungodly hole like the andamans but by geor ge england is quite another af fair is why inquired his listener rather grimly oh my dear fellow she has not was literally her father died she was destitute pg 245 pg 246 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https but you always understood that she had fortune yes but when i came to look at it i saw that it would never i had next to nothing she had nothing at all one can not live on love and i think i was ever really serious i did you good turn though you were rather inclined to make fool of yourself in that quarter administering playful poke in the ribs and grinning signiﬁcantly but the grin on his face faded somew hat suddenly he encountered look in his companion eyes that made him feel curiously uncomfortable where is she now inquired lisle speaking in low repressed sort of tone my honour i ca tell you i believe she has gone out thing she could you know better than marrying poor devil like he added apologetically she was nice enough little girl and she had not half bad time of it in the andamans i daresay she pick up some fellow at home look here old chappie him he spoke this is my card and address now what day will you come and dine got cook that you ever were particular wife has pots of money and we give rather swagger entertainments whatever day will suit you will suit you have only to say the word i have only to say the word have i cried gilbert suddenly blazing into passion then i say that you are scoundrel quentin i say that you have behaved like one to that girl that what i say apollo recoiled precipitately he did not like the angry light in his old friend face nor the manner in which he grasped his cane you jilted her on your own showing in the most deliberate manner jilted her because you were tired of passing fancy and she was left you say penniless and destitute she may thank her stars lucky escape better she should beg her bread than be the wife of cur like you there your card tearing it into pieces and scattering it on the ﬂoor in my opinion you should be kicked out of decent society and turned out of every respectable club in london i beg that the future you will be good enough to give wide berth and with nod of unsp eakable contempt he turned and walked away leaving his foe absolutely speechless with rage and amazement underneath these mixed feelings lay smouldering conviction that lisle all his customary nonchalance could be bitter and unsparing an enemy he had been generous and useful friend pleasant stately houses would slam their doors on him at hint from lisle and if the story got about the clubs and was looked at from lisle point of view would be the very deuce in his exaltation he had somewhat forgotten the rôle he formerly played with his fellow inmate we know that to liar good memory is indispensable had spoken rashly and foolishly with his lips and had been thus summarily condemned out of his own mouth alas alas he already saw his circle of titled friends narrowing to vanishing point he now recalled veiled threat uttered by the very man who had just denounced him on the whole quentin thought that his little comedy with miss denis would prove an expensive performance and he returned to his wealthy partner feeling very much like beaten hound that evening gilbert lisle drove up to the door of durand mansion he said to himself here i come to the very house of all others where i am most likely to hear the sequel to that rascal story durand is safe to know all about helen denis if she is the woman i take her to be she wo be long before i know much she does herself i shall say shall not ask single question about the young lady not indeed that it personally concerns whether she is on the parish or not still i should like to hear what has become of her he made these resolutions he entered and passed upstairs and presented himself in the pg 247 pg 248 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https to say charles durand had arrived at precisely similar determination with regard to him hitherto they had only exchanged few hasty words had opportunity of raking up old days but it would be different at dinner he is sure to make some allusion to port blair and her name will come on the tapis and i can easily judge by his looks if there was anything in my very strong suspicions they were however i wo be the ﬁrst to break the ice far helen is shall be dumb thus durand to her own reﬂection in the mirror she attired herself the evening here were two people about to meet each resolved to be silent and each determined to hear the other disclosures on an intensely interesting subject is usual in such cases the lady yielded ﬁrst her opponent was habitually reserved and it came second nature to him to wait and to hold his peace he had one false alarm during dinner when his former playmate addressing him across the table said with her brightest air i saw particular friend of yours who you think it was i have so many particular friends he replied that rather lar ge order well lady friend lady friend they are not much in my way lady you knew in the andamans looking at him keenly he cast quick questioning glance at her but remained otherwise dumb and she smiling at her own little ruse said in short our cree ry she was driving in the park in dreadful yellow affair like an omnibus cut down along with another remarkable old person she was delighted to see and hailed if i had been child durand smiled to herself again she was thinking of the battle royal she had fought with creery over the reputation of the very gentleman who was now her she asked particularly you and sent you not sure that it was not her told to be sure and tell you that monday is her day i really see any connection between creery mondays and myself coolly rejoined that lady former and with few general remarks abou t port blair the monsoon the sharks and the shells the conversation drifted back to less way regions the younger members of the party set out after dinner the savoy to see gilbert and sullivan latest production they consisted of captain and durand two young lady cousins guardsman and lisle durand and the latter occupied the back seat in the box and discoursed of the piece mutual friends and mutual aversions with scrupulous avoidance of the one topic nearest their hearts at last the lady could stand it longer and during the interval after the ﬁrst act she turned to her companion and said rather sharply you remember miss denis miss yes of course i those are her cousins in the box next the girls in pink is she living with them oh dear she stayed month or two on her ﬁrst arrival and by all accounts they led her the life of modern cinderella and afterwards turned her off to earn her bread governess indeed he ejaculated with such stoical indifference that durand felt that she could have shaken him but after moment silence he added i always thought she had married pg 249 pg 250 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https oh nonsense you are not really serious of course you are aware that your friend apollo has espoused widow with quantities of money in the oil trade pray not call him my friend i am not at all anxious to claim that honour he rejoined stifﬂy then you have been quarrelling i suppose i wonder if it was about the usual one of my sex it was i may say much to you in fact it was about miss treated her shamefully what makes you think so her eyes very wide and shutting up her fan because he was engaged to her at port blair he told so and when she was left penniless he jilted her this rich widow he told you that he was engaged to helen oh drawing long breath never yes and showed ring she had given him again i say never never never my dear durand there is good in saying never never never like that the ring he exhibited was one that i had given miss denis myself oh sets the wind in that quarter mentally exclaimed the matron i thought much but aloud she replied was it curious old ring without any stones that was stolen from her the night of the ball it was the ring you describe but it was not stolen she gave it to quentin when he went to the nicobars i expected that he would have married her soon possible after her father death indeed i understood that he was returning from camorta with that intention but you see i have been so completely out of the world that i heard nothing further till i met quentin and his wife at the academy and he calmly informed that he had never seriously contemplated marrying miss denis and that the andamans and london are quite different pair of shoes pray you call that honourable conduct you are quite quite wrong cried durand excitedly now you have said your say it is my turn to speak and speak i will she added with gleam of determ ination in her eye oh certainly returned her listener with rather dry politeness helen was and is particular friend of mine and i happen to know that she could not endure apollo quentin she did not even think him and he bored her to death he stuck to her like burr and she could not shake him off she would ten times rather have talked to captain rodney or green even to you she was more engaged to him than i was she never gave him that ring her listener stirred and made gesture of impatient that ring was stolen and sold twenty rupees concluded durand in her most forcible manner he echoed turning towards her so suddenly that it made her start is this true true she repeated indignantly i not mean to doubt you one second but you may have been deceived at any rate i had the beneﬁt of my own eyes and ears they not often mislead then if you will only have patience you shall hear all helen stayed with the last week at port blair and the night before she sailed when i went into her room i discovered fatima grovelling on the ground at her feet and holding the hem of her dress and whining in true native fashion i very bad woman missy she was pg 251 pg 252 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https i very sorry now i stealing i sent here and now i done take missy ring and sell twenty rupees sold it to whom interrupted mr lisle his dark face ﬂushing to his temples that she refused to divulge all we could prevail on her to confess was that she had taken it the night of the ball and that she did not think it was of any value but seeing how much trouble missy was in missy going away to england she was plenty sorry stolen the night of the twenty rupees and quentin showed it to the next morning exclaimed lisle after this summing up he and durand looked at each other about twenty seconds in dead silence where is miss denis now he inquired in kind of husky whisper i wish i could tell you i miserable correspondent i never answered her last letter written from school at kensington i would rather walk two miles than write two pages it very sad and gets into great disgrace but though i not write i forget people soon i arrived at home i went off to this school to see helen and to make my peace yes the house was all shut up blinds down in every window the cook in sole charge every one else away the holidays the cook only showed half her face through the door and was not at all inclined to be commun icative but i gave her something to help her memory and then she recollected that six weeks before the school broke up the english governess had gone away sick but she understood that she had not left school opens again on the 1st of september added durand signiﬁcantly meanwhile where is she that is more than i can say perhaps her cousins would tell you glancing over at the miss platts not they did know i doubt if they would inform you they are even more disagreeable than they look that is saying much however i shall get friend to sound them about their cousin i believe they treated her like servant and made her carry parcels run messages mend their clothes and button their boots how did you hear this from miss denis she never named them i afraid to tell you lest you should think second creery could be but

will be crœsus yet he this is the dairy interrupted dido suddenly turning big key mind the step it struck helen that she frequently broke in upon the current of her sister narratives especially when

by high grey walls and wholly devoted to fruit and vegetables grass pathways lined with currant and gooseberry bushes divided it into immense plots of potatoes peas and cabbages in some places so

who never did anything but loaf and poach in those days andy was or boy about the yard and he and this john were always quarrelling one day john beat him cruelly and andy was heard to declare that he would certainly have his life anyway short time afterwards dillon was found shot dead up at the black gate between this and ballyredmond and andy was taken up and lodged in jail however he was soon dischar ged it was proved at the inquest that dillon gun must have gone off accidentally though some people say it did not to this some people will say any rate the whole affair gave andy such terrible fright that he has never been the same since and how is he af fected chieﬂy by the sight of he calls him at the ﬁrst glimpse he takes to his heels and runs his life he never ventures beyond

buried in his experiments people have all sorts of ideas about us they think that the padré practises the black art and that dido and i keep pigs in the parlour and in the back hall helen laughed aloud at this description if crowmore was shabby it was beautifully clean and if her cousins occasionally used the ﬁrst thing to hand instead of regulation implement the interior of the house was not merely neat but tasteful of course that an exaggeration said dido but one calls here excepting the rector barry and old redmond he comes from mere idle curiosity to see if we are all alive and the

at her post she taxed all comers and taxed them most success fully the little world of crowmore were mortally afraid to draw down the fancy tongue and she received propitiatory offerings of sods of turf and locks of male from her own class and numerous sixpences and coppers from neighbours she was the mother of andy all right and looked to the castle with conﬁdence the supply of her wardrobe and praties and sweet milk she would sorely vex the spirits of those who ﬁguratively buttoned up their pockets by loud uncomplimentary remarks on their personal appearance painful allusions to family secrets and dismal prophetic warnings of their future downfall many man would rather if he had small change go round of two miles than run the gauntlet of the fancy corner she had also other means of

genial she gave the two sheridans limp and bestowed curt bow and long stare upon their cousin the governess who was looking remarkably pretty and in one of the costumes upon which creery had once ﬁxed her elderly affections evidently she did not think that miss denis was entitled to participate in the advantages of her acquaintance and patronage however redmond more than atoned his ward deﬁciencies

bland wave of his hand his beautiful young protégée the desired partner of several eligible tennis players was simply not allowed to have voice in the matter we are very happy here just go away my good fellow and leave us alone was his complacent reply to each eager suitor you and i to helen will better than that we will stroll round the grounds together when all these energetic idiots have

always the slave of beauty here he doffed his hat and made helen most courtly bow at which she blushed and laughed yes the slave of beauty all the same resuming his hat with ﬂourish i never married you see the fact was i butterﬂied about too long and then it was winter before i knew where i was we are not marrying family there my sister and mysel f and my nephew i always preaching to him but he laughs when i talk to him and tells to go and marry rascal that nice way to speak to his uncle eh all the same he is ﬁne fellow true steel and more honourable upright gentleman never drew breath whoever gets him husband will be lucky girl the corners of his companion pretty lips curved somewhat scornfully and she said to herself shall i explode social torpedo under this innocent old gentleman

been talking to you about him the last hour and you never told this cried mr redmond eyeing her with an air of angry suspicion eh what you mentioned name faltered the young lady feeling that verily this quibbling with the truth was bad any downright lie but confronted by three curious faces with the eyes of gilbert lisle gilbert lisle betrothed ﬁxed imperatively on she to appease their greedy curiosity and boldly confess the painful reason of her silence was she to proclaim the humiliating fact that they were all staring at the girl who had been jilted by that honourable gentleman mentioned i did and how were you to know eh what well and what did you think of my nephew inquired the loquacious old relative at this query miss calder wood ﬂashed satirical look at miss denis much to say what silly unnecessary question but helen met her eyes with proud steadiness i think most people liked mr lisle she answered with carelessness and how long was he at the andamans continued mr redmond about six months six months and what was he doing there all that time any little rather anxiously i can not tell you ah see that you know more about gilbert than you will admit exclaimed miss calderwood with sharp accusing glanc i believe girls in india are odious creatures i have doubt he got into some scrape out there helen blushed scarlet yes with an unpleasant little laugh your face tells tales i suppose he was drawn into some silly are such fools well it is very good of you to keep his secret it more than others would have done and with this insolent hint and patronizing nod the heiress walked on helen felt almost breathless with ange she had the passions of her kind her eyes sparkled her nostrils quivered she gazed after her receding rival what had she done that she should be insulted and ﬂouted by this supercilious heiress scrape f flirtation it all jealousy every bit of it cried redmond he removed his hat and cautiously passed his bandana across his forehead gilbert

when he does there nothing in his letters come now what did he how did he pass his time i really can not tell you lived long way off on the mainland i believe he spent his days in ﬁshing and sailing

the i want to have chat with old morony i need not tell you i much rather stay here walking about with you he added gallant ly but i must not be too selﬁsh and i give the young fellows chance so helen was at last released from this purgatorial and permitted to join the rest of the company when she took leave of miss calderwood which i must say she did very stifﬂy she read more than mere contemptuous dismissal in that lady eyes she saw suspicion ay and dislike lurking in those shallow grey orbs but redmond wrung her hand affectionately at parting and said in his heartiest manner and

invented end of wonderful things interrupted katie proudly helen looked up expectantly and dido answered yes little machines measuring and weighing air but unfortunately his most remarkable contrivances have all been discovered before and what is he doing now he is constructing an apparatus that is to be the marvel of the age it is to be an overwhelming success surprise to humanity but i not know what it is can you not guess dido shook her head gravely and katie burst out poor papa is out of his element here when we were till dido was lived in germany you know at cheap little place called kraut and the padré had plenty of congenial society and made many literary friends who profess great interest in his work still he takes them into his conﬁdence they know all about often write

added you two can ﬁnish it without and i must go in and weigh the strawberries so saying she tucked her stool under her arm pushed her way through the bushes and vanished dido is vexed exclaimed her sister looking straight at helen and indeed it is trying sometimes to think that while she works so hard to earn few shillings the padré sends away hundreds of pounds to any person who chooses to write him ﬂattering begging letters and he spends fortune on scientiﬁc works he orders whole boxes full and when they come he never even opens them there are dozen great cases all mouldering out in the when mamma was alive she kept some of the money and she and the old steward managed pretty well after they died there was of course the padré could not have his mind disturbed about pigs and grazing stock after time he took great fancy to darby and darby and dido their and very bad it is barry wanted to manage the property but papa was furious at the bare notion i myself think it would have been good plan but dido set her face against it and when she does that you may give up your point you have idea how poor we are helen helen thought she had some glimmering could not be poorer than she was her uncle having borrowed all her earnings with the exception of few shillings shortly after her arrival what becomes of the rent she asked oh i know it paid to papa and the money the grazing is paid to him also admitted katie reluctantly and what has uncle done with his time all these years she asked impatiently rome was not built in day rejoined katie rather confusedly i believe he is making something marvellous and that it is nearly completed of course we are pinched now but we shall be rich some day i grumble neither does dido we believe the padré will be the great man of the age and that in years to come we shall be known the daughters of the celebrated malachi sheridan helen noticed not the ﬁrst time that katie generally talked ﬂuently of her father in her sister

sent it back by the next post oh groaned helen how frightful and was mr halliday nice very course i go by dido the reids were enchanted with him he came here nothing daunted and insisted on papa giving him an audience i was my biddy told they were shut up in the an hour and that she heard the padré roaring and raving like all the bulls of bashan at last halliday came out looking very white

against him and he was ready to take her out to india then and there and give her happy home and she said she would have one and what was that i been trying to ﬁnd out two years and never discovered

resembling old father time with pinions which rose and fell expanded or collapsed at will she stood and stared in blank bewilderm ent the creature like gorged vulture appeared to be making futile

with rudder may pass through the air i quote from his opus magnus which he wrote in the form of letter to that enlightened prelate pope clement the fourth if anything had been needed to convince helen and her cousins of the practicability of the matter in question the mention of roger bacon was sufﬁcient and sheridan noting the expression of reverent atten tion on their faces was kindled to still greater enthusiasm bacon was marvellous man it is true that he indulged in chimerical notions with regard to prolonging life and placed some conﬁdence in astrology yet the imputation on his character of leaning to magic was totally unfounded he studied languages logic and mathematics his information was exhaustive his premises sound in the case in point waving his hand dramatically towards the

himself erect before them and commenced to pace up and down cleared space at the end of the room and he paced to and fro he continued to expound volubly ever on the importan ce of his prodigious

suspicions yet she could not divest herself of the idea that he was rascal she was aware that darby did not eye her with any favour and indeed he had more than once made inquiries to when she was going away it was use said dido entering the room and shaking her head hopelessly i knew it he just held up empty hands that is his invariable answer when i beg little money it will just have to be

cousin hand in hers and her face was full of sympathy he was only little strange at times continued dido especially about money but during the last year i have seen it coming and this is one reason i always resisted having barry to live here and taking over the place this is the reason that i struggle with all my might to keep him and the padré apart if he and barry were to meet constantly barry would know and barry would immediately insist upon what is only to be the last resource i promised mamma here dido broke down and leaning her head against her cousin shoulder wept miserably my poor

cut out he was going away and was utterly reckless i believe he had comfortable conviction that he could commit any social enormity in those islands with the utmost impunity he believed that when he sailed away he put himself beyond the reach of all reprisals and now helen what you say if you only knew what i have felt the last fortnight you would think that i been pretty well punished being quentin dupe am i guilty or not guilty can you ever give yes i give you she replied at length with little catch in her breath and we will go back to where we left off that evening at port blair

young lady blushing crimson i think you might give it in charity so be it obediently placing it in his waistcoat pocket after all i glad that you and the ﬂower were identical i alway s thought you were the prettiest girl in the world and it gave quite an unpleasant shock to see your counterpart after this speech it was longer in helen power to say that lisle had never paid her compliment and who have we here coming down the hill with brace of rabbits over his shoulders and gun under his arm he asked abruptly helen glanced behind her and beheld man approaching with black beard and peaked cap and shrank closer to her companion instinctively she answered it must be john dillon pg 358 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https it was the seemingly solitary white ﬁgure offered peculiarly tempting opportunity to the ghost and he advanced with long and rapid strides not being aware of the presence of third party who was at the other side of the gate and somewhat in the shade he was within three yards of helen and had already stretched out threatening arm when hullo john in masculine voice caused him to pause and recoil step or two i say you seem to have had good sport john glowered backed and would have ﬂed but gilbert was too quick him he vaulted over the gate and said come here my friend and give an account of yourself it not every day that i see ghost let have look at you very slowly and reluctantly the spectre slouched back and stood within few feet of his questioner flight was useless he had to deal with man of half his age and thrice his activity moreover his gun was not loaded and so i hear that you made capital bag on our bog on the eleventh john what you with your game you know you have game licence and are terrible poacher woodcock pheasants hares all come handy to you my uncle tells that three hundred head of his long tails were sent away to dublin and sold last winter and this in spite of watchers at night and every precaution you wo leave head of game in the county now i mind betting sovereign that you have brace of grouse in one of your pockets here john who had hitherto simply stood and glowered showed signs of moving off but his captor took him ﬁrmly by the arm and leading him out beyond the shadow of the trees said darby chute if i not greatly mistaken i suspected you years just take off your cap will you now your beard if you please and sure enough there stood darby some seconds there was an eloquent silence broken at last by helen who notwithstanding her scepticism of mr chute was unprepared this dénouement oh darby how could you she exclaimed with horror gilbert he stammered in tremulous voice i known ye man and boy and ever since ye wor terror with the catapult was i ﬁrst taught you to handle ferrets and sure you would not go and expose now why should i not you have poached this estate the last ten years not modestly now and then like your neighbours but systematically if you had leased the shooting you must have made your fortune fortune indeed an how would i make fortune indignantly easily darby what about the white cow you sold miss dido twenty pounds and you only gave her sixteen demanded helen authoritatively arrah what are you talking about miss he asked with an air of virtuous repudiation ye want to destroy mee character it is all right darby i was there i heard you sell it to man named james casey we will send him if you like faix i see i may well make clean breast of see that it all over remarked darby with sullen if you mean the shooting of the best covers in the county and robbing old sheridan i think you are about right and that it is all over returned gilbert emphatically well sure if i did not take from him some one else would was the cool rejoinder is shame the likes of him to be tempting poor people pg 359 pg 360 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https i suppose it was your shots that we used to hear in the woods i expect it was mr gilbert and it was you who terriﬁed the wits out of every one after especially other poachers that was clever dodge it was not too bad people does be very wake in themse lves and shy at night and there are not half enough knaves in the world the fools that are in it you are most infernal rascal maybe i am mr gilbert but i never went again conscience you could not well go against what you have not got and sure what is game but wild birds and the cow was she wild bird suppose you sent all your bags to dublin faix an i did mr gilbert returned darby with perfect equanimity and who bought your spoil oh spalpeen in william street rale chate he never gave more ner two shillings brace you have dalings with him said the culprit with heroic impudence and now what am i to with you chute you are convicted here thief and poacher on your own confession well now since you ax i think ye might well let off gilbert sure it wo be pleasure or relief to you to prosecute and old mother would think bad of going to jail wo you spake word miss helen sure there one but yourself can say hate against and ye would not like to be put up in the witness box at terryscreen you need not be distressed about miss denis darby said gilbert sternly i could prove enough without her if i let you off it will be on account of your old mother and because i known you ever since i could walk and because the harm is done now and to publish your knavery would make half the county look like fools look here gilbert i never offer to ﬁre shot in anyone ground again nor to set foot in crowmore and i make restitution on the cow an wan or two small matters beside in all twinty pounds there now i laying sins bare before what more can i you can leave the country you must clear out within hours and never show your face again in these parts either john dillon or darby chute and to the restitution i shall have word with father fagan he will see to that very well gilbert he rejoined quietly you plase but i warn you that there will be nations of poachers in it when i go nations or not go you must i wonder what my uncle would say if he knew i let you off so cheap then gilbert i thinking he would just destroy both you and somever i brother in america and i long laid out to go there so it not putting much about and is less inconvenient than jail well i daresay you will be smart enough even some of them shure how would i be smart that never had book learning protested darby scornfully look here gilbert if that your young faix it looks like i never saw any one make worse hand of coortin than yourself raally i surprised at ye you at one side of the gate and her at the other miss helen now turning to her i suppose ye may well have this brace of grouse producing the birds from his pocket pg 361 pg 362 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https and with regard to that little account you were spakin of and the other change i send it up the ﬁrst thing in the morning and may be you wo let on but it was mistake indeed darby i shall tell the whole truth cried helen indignantly you need not expect to keep such thing secret well i be out of it so it great matter gilbert bye miss helen you and i were never very thick still i wish you both luck and grace and that you may live long and die happy and picking up his cap and gun darby chute walked away with considerable dignity there nice rufﬁan you exclaimed gilbert emphatically yes and to think how he must have robbed uncle and poor dido and to think of the years he has been poaching the country however never mind him now we have something else to talk about but there the stable clock striking eight and i must go and it your dinne at ballyredmond not i want any dinner could manly devotion go further i am going to walk back with you thank goodness there is creery to hustle away this time to his proposal the young lady made demur protestations not even when he insisted on taking her home by the longe st way up the hill out by the road and in by the new avenue the whole distance was about of mile the time occupied of an hour the moon full harvest moon had risen and the twilight had given place to light almost clear day seated on her own smoking her little dhudeen they descried the fancy she saw them the unexpected appearance of an young couple strolling down the road was welcome windfall to this active old woman who instantly sprang up and darted out to waylay them with her invariable whine of give the poor old woman the price of cup of tay your honour oh recognizing him and is yourself is welcome home own darling gilbert give the price of new petticoat and that you may gain the lady in answer to this romantic appeal he promptly threw her the sovereign that helen had returned and judy having made herself acquainted with the value of the coin accompanied the lovers to the gates overpowering them the while with shrill benedictions from the following few words it would appear if the fancy good wishes were wholly superﬂuous and that the lady had already surrendered she said she paused up the avenue you really must not come any further and pray why not because they know nothing and it will look so strange she stammered i should like to tell them ﬁrst she added rather shyly then i shall come over at may i come to breakfast yes you may holding out her hand and is that all i am not going to let you run off like that this time detaining her you have gotten something oh of course how stupid of grouse to be sure the grouse replied was far bolder than darby imagined two minutes later helen cousins had been sitting with the door open and the hall door usual eagerly listening to every sound her running up pg 363 pg 364 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https

have been away nearly two hours have i really she exclaimed apologetically i did not think i had been half that time the anxieties of her relatives had evidently not been shared by barry who sat with his feet upon chair paper in his hand and look of stolid indif ference on his face well did you see dillon he demanded she entered the oh yes i saw him she returned carelessly and here exhibiting the birds are brace of grouse he gave i believe you bringing down his boots with loud bang and there his beard tossing black object into katie lap immediately rose with loud shriek and shook it of f if it had been rattlesnake i tell you something else herself specially to her cousins what you think we made grand discovery this evening john dillon the notorious ghost poacher is your esteemed friend darby chute when the ensuing storm of exclamations and questions had somewhat subsided dido said suddenly but surely he never confessed all this to you alone who was with you what you mean by we helen

go that is by means irksome to that young lady and the misses platt tell all their acquaintance what an odious ungrateful creature she is and how once upon time they took her in and kept her out of charity and this is their reward nevertheless the honourable gilbert lisle does not forget old friends she is not ashamed to see the smithson villa vehicle standing before her door and she has more than once visited at malvern house and entertained kane and some of her former pupils lord lingard has been altogether captivated by his daughter she is everything his heart desires young pretty and

garden is pruned the yard is reclaimed and the are roofed and ﬁlled katie is happy in her own way she rather enjoys being bullied by barry is lenient to his little foibles and she listens to his vainglorious personal reminiscences with deep interest and implicit faith on one point alone she is somewhat sceptical that barry could have married her cousin had he chosen pretty cousin helen who occasionally drives over from pg 365 project gutenberg ebook of bird of passage by croker https in smart stanhope phaeton and seems perfectly satisﬁed with her own husband and who snubs barry
