dead but in one they repose in green alleys and beneath the open the other their resting place is in the shadowy aisle and beneath the dim arches of an ancient abbey one is temple of nature the other temple of art in one the soft melancholy of the scene is rendered still more touching by the warble of birds and the shade of trees and the grave receives the gentle visit of the sunshine and the shower in the other sound but the passing footfall breaks the silence of the place the twilight steals in through high and dusky windows and the damps of the gloomy vault lie heavy on the heart and leave their stain upon the moldering tracery of the tomb père lachaise stands just beyond the barrière on hillside looking toward the city numerous gravel walks winding through shady avenues and between marble monuments lead up from the principal entrance to chapel on the summit there is hardly grave that has not its little enclosure planted with shrubbery and thick mass of foliage half conceals each funeral stone the sighing of the wind the branches rise and fall upon occasional note of bird among the trees and the shifting of light and shade upon the tombs beneath have soothing effect upon the mind and i doub t whether any one can enter that enclosure where repose the dust and ashes of so many great and good men without feeling the religion of the place steal over him and seeing something of the dark and gloomy expression pass of f from the stern countenance of death it was near the close of bright summer afternoon that i visited this celebrated spot the ﬁrst time the ﬁrst object that arres ted my attention on entering was monument in the form of small gothic chapel whic h stands near the entrance in the avenu leading 3 4 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume x of 10 index https the right hand on the marble couch within are stretched two ﬁgures carved in stone and drest in the antique garb of the middle ages it is the tomb of abélard and héloïse the history of these two unfortunate lovers is too well known to need recapitulation but perhaps it is not so well known how often their ashes were disturbed in the slum ber of the grave abélard died in the monastery of marcel and was buried in the vaults of the church his body was afterward removed to the convent of the paraclete at the request of héloïse and at her death her body was deposited in the same tomb three centu ries they reposed together after which they were separated to different sides of the church to calm the delicate scruples of the lady abbess of the convent more than century afterward they were again united in the same tomb and when at length the paraclete was destroyed their moldering remains were transported to the church of they were next deposited in an ancient cloister at paris and now repose near the gateway of the cemetery of père lachaise what singular destiny was theirs that after life of such passionate and disastrous sorrows and tears and very dust should not be suffered to rest quietly in the grave their death should so much resemble their life in its changes and vicissitudes its partings and its meetings its inquietudes and its persecutions mistaken zeal should follow them down to the very if earthly passion could glimmer like funeral lamp amid the damps of the charnel house and even in their ashes burn their wonted ﬁres i gazed on the sculptured forms before and the little chapel whose gothic roof seemed to protect their marble sleep my busy memory swung back the dark portals of the past and the picture of their sad and eventful lives came up before in the gloomy distance what lesson those who are endowed with the fatal gift of genius it would seem indeed that he who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb tempers also his chastisements to the errors and inﬁrmities of weak and simple the transgressions of him upon whose nature are more strongly marked the intellectual attributes of the deity are followed even upon earth by severer tokens of the divine displeasure he who sins in the darkness of benighted intellect sees not so clearly through the shadows that surround him the countenance of an offended god but he who sins in the broad noonday of clear and radiant mind when at length the delirium of sensual passion has subsided and the cloud ﬂits away from before the sun trembles beneath the searching eye of that accusing power which is strong in the strength of godlike intellect thus the mind and the heart are closely linked together and the errors of genius bear with them their own chastisement even upon earth the history of abélard and héloïse is an illustration of this truth but at length they sleep well their lives are like tale that is told their errors are folded up like book and what mortal hand shall break the seal that death has set upon them leaving this interesting tomb behind i took pathway to the left which conducted up the hillside i soon found myself in the deep shade of heavy foliage where the branches of the yew and willow mingled interwoven with the tendrils and blossoms of the honeysuckle i now stood in the most populous part of this city of tombs every step awakened new train of thrilling recollections at every step my eye caught the name of some one whose glory had exalted the character of his native land and resounded across the waters of the atlantic philosophers historians musicians warriors and poets slept side by side around some beneath the gorgeous monument and some beneath the simple headstone but the politica l intrigue the dream of science

but the soul whos high volitions it obeyed still lives to reproduce itself in ages yet to come amid these graves of genius i observed here and there splendid monument which had been raised by the pride of family over the dust of men who could lay claim either to the gratitude or remembrance of poster ity their presence seemed like an intrusion into the sanctuary of genius what had wealth to there why should it crowd the dust of the great that was thoroughfare of mart of gain there were costly banquets there silken garments nor gaudy liveries nor obsequious attendan ts what 5 6 7 the

cleanse away the moist and unwholesome cloud reﬂected upon our faces from the sides of the weeping vaults which are the longest weepers our funerals material wealth gives factitious superiority to the living but the treasures of intellect give real superiority to the dead and the rich man who would not deign to walk the street with the starving and penniless man of genius deems it an honor when death has redeemed the fame of the neglected to have his ashes laid beside him and to claim with him the silent companionship of the grave i continued my walk through the numerous winding paths chance or curiosity directed now i was lost in little green hollow overhung with shrubbery and then came out upon an elevation from which through an opening in the trees the eye caught glimpses of the city and the little esplanade at the foot of the hill where the poor lie buried there poverty hires its grave and takes but short lease of the narrow house at the end of few months or at most of few years the tenant is dislodged to give place to another and he in turn to third who says sir thomas browne knows the fate of his bones or how often he is to be buried who hath the oracle of his ashes or whither they are to be scattered yet even in that neglected corner the hand of affection had been busy in deco rating the hired house most of the graves were surrounded with slight wooden paling to secure them from the passing footstep there was hardly one so deserted not to be marked with its little wooden cross and decorated with garland of ﬂowers and here and there i could perceive solitary mourner clothed in black stooping to plant shrub on the grave or sitting in motionless sorrow beside it i passed on amid the shadowy aven ues of the cemetery i could not help comparing my own impressions with those which others have felt when walking alone among the dwellings of the dead are then the sculptured urn and storied monument nothing more than symbols of family pride is all i see around memorial of the living more than of the dead an empty show of sorrow which thus vaunts itself in mournful pageant and funeral parade is it indeed true some have said that the simple wild ﬂower which springs spontaneously upon the grave and the rose which the hand of affection plants there are ﬁtter objects wherewith to adorn the narrow house i feel that it is not so let the good and the great be honored even in the grave let the sculptured marble direct our footsteps to the scene of their long sleep let the chiseled epitaph repeat their names and tell us where repose the nobly good and wise it is not true that all are equal in the grave there is equality even there the mere handful of dust and ashes the mere distinction of prince and beggar of rich winding sheet and shroudless burial of solitary grave and family this all then indeed it would be true that death is common leveler such paltry distinc tions those of wealth and poverty are soon leveled by the spade and mattock the damp breath of the grave blots them out forever but there are other distinctions which even the mace of death can not level or obliterate can it break down the distinction of virtue and vice can it confound the good with the bad the noble with the base all that is truly great and pure and godlike with all that is scorned and sinful and degraded then death is not common leveler before i left the graveyard the shades of evening had fallen and the objects around grown dim and indistinct i passed the gateway i turned to take parting look i could distinguish only the chapel on the summit of the hill and here and there lofty obelisk of marble rising from the black and heavy mass of foliage around and pointing upward to the gleam of the departed sun that still lingered in the sky and

was about dusk one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season that i encountered my friend he accosted with excessive warmth he had been drinking much the man wore motley he had on dress and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells i was so pleased to see him that i thought i should never have done wringing his hand i said to him my dear fortunato you are luckily met how remarkable well you are looking but i have received pipe of what passes amontillado and i have my doubts how said he amontillado pipe impossible and in the middle of the carnival i have my doubts i replied and i was silly enough to pay the full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter you were not to be found and i was fearful of losing bar gain amontillado i have my amontillado and i must satisfy them amontillado you are engaged i am on my way to luchesi if any one has critical turn it is he he will tell luchesi can not tell amontillado from sherry and yet some fools will have it that his taste is match your own come let us go whither to your vaults my friend i will not impose upon your good nature i perceive you have an engagement i have engagement come 11 12 the

ferably damp they are encrusted with niter let us go nevertheless the cold is merely nothing amontillado you have been imposed upon and luchesi he can not distinguish sherry from amontillado thus speaking fortunato possest himself of my arm putting on mask of black silk and drawing roquelaur closely about my person i suf fered him to hurry to my palazzo there were attendants at home they had absconded to make merry in honor of the time i had told them that i should not return until the morning and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house these orders were sufﬁcient i well knew to insure their immediate disappearance one and all soon my back was turned i took from their sconces two ﬂambeaux and giving one to fortunato bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults i passed down long and winding staircase requesting him to be cautious he followed we came at length to the foot of the descent and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the montresors the gait of my friend was unsteady and the bells upon his cap jingled he strode the pipe said he it is farther on said i but observe the white which gleams from these cavern walls he turned toward and looked into my eyes with two ﬁlmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication niter he asked at length niter i replied how long have you had that cough ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh my poor friend found it impossible to reply many minutes it is nothing he said at last come i said with decision we will go back your health is precious you are rich respected admired beloved you are happy once i was you are man to be missed it is matter we will go back you will be ill and i can not be responsible besides there is enough he said the cough is mere nothing it will not kill i shall not die i replied and indeed i had intention of alarming you but you should use all proper caution draft of this medoc will defend us from the damps here i knocked off the neck of bottle which i drew from long row of its fellows that lay upon the mold drink i said presenting him the wine he raised it to his lips with leer he paused and nodded to familiarly while his bells jingled i drink he said to the buried that repose around us and i to your long life he again took my arm and we proceeded 13 14 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of

passed through walls of piled bones with casks and puncheons intermingling into the inmost recesses of the catacombs i paused again and this time i made bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow the niter i said see it increases it hangs like moss upon the vaults we are below the river bed the drops of moisture trickle among the bones come we will go back ere it is too late your it is nothing he said let us go on but ﬁrst another draft of the medoc i broke and reached him ﬂagon of grave he emptied it at breath his eyes ﬂashed with ﬁerce light he laughed and threw the bottle upward with gesticulation i did not understand i looked at him in surprize he repeated the grotesque one you not comprehend he said not i i replied then you are not of the brotherhood how you are not of the masons yes yes i said yes yes you impossible mason mason i replied sign he said it is this i answered producing trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaur you jest he exclaimed recoiling few paces but let us proceed to the amontillado be it so i said replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm he leaned upon it heavily we continued our route in search of the amontillado we passed through range of low arches descended passed on and descending again arrived at deep crypt in which the foulness of the air caused our ﬂambeaux rather to glow than ﬂame at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious its walls had been lined with human remains piled to the vault overhead in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner from the fourth the bones had been thrown down and lay promiscuously upon the earth forming at one point mound of some size within the walls thus exposed by the displacing of the bones we perceived still interior recess in depth about four feet 15 16 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume x of 10 index https width three in height six or seven it seemed to have been constructed special use within itself but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite it was in vain that fortunato uplifting his dull torch endeavored to pry into the depth of the recess its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see proceed i said herein is the amontillado he is an ignoramus interrupted my friend he stept unsteadily forward while i followed immediately at his heels in an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche and ﬁnding his progress arrested by the rock stood stupidly bewildered moment more and i had fettered him to the granite in its surface were two iron staples distant from each other about two feet horizontally from one of these depended short chain from the other padlock throw ing the links about his waist it was but the work of few seconds to secure it he was too much astounded to resist withdrawing the key i stept back from the recess pass your hand i said over the wall you can not help feeling the niter indeed it is very damp once more let implore you to return then i must positiv ely leave you but i must ﬁrst render you all the little attentions in my power the amontillado ejaculated my friend not yet recovered from his astonishment true i replied the amontillado i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which i have before spoken throwing them aside i soon uncovered quantity of building stone and mortar with these materials and with the aid of my trowel i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche i had scarcely laid the ﬁrst tier of the masonry when i discovered that the intoxication of fortunato had in great measure worn off the earliest indication i had of this was low moaning cry from the depth of the recess it was not the cry of drunken man there was then long and obstinate silence i laid the second tier and the third and the fourth and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain the noise lasted several minutes during which that i might harken to it with the more satisfaction i ceased my labors and sat down upon the bones when at last the clanking subsided i resumed the trowel and ﬁnished without interruption the ﬁfth the sixth and the seventh tier the wall was now nearly upon level with my breast i again paused and holding the ﬂambeaux over the threw few feeble rays upon the ﬁgure within succession of loud and shrill screams bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form seemed to thrust violently back brief moment i trembled unsheathing my rapier i began to grope with it about the recess but the thought of an instant reassured i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs and felt satisﬁed i reapproached the wall i replied to the yells of him who clamored i reechoed surpassed them in volume and in strength i did this and the clam orer grew still it was now midnight and my task was drawing to close i had completed the eighth the ninth and the tenth tier i had ﬁnished portion of the last and the eleventh there remained but single stone to be ﬁtted and plastered in i struggled with its weight i placed it partially in its destined position but now there came from out the niche low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head it was succeeded by sad voice which i had difﬁculty in recognizing that of the noble fortunato the voice said ha ha ha he very good excellent jest we will have many rich laugh about it at the he he our he he the amontillado i said 17 18 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume x of 10 index https he he he he he the amontillado but is it not getting late will they not be awaiting us at the palazzo the lady fortunato and the rest let us be gone yes i said let us be gone the love of god montresor yes i said the love of god but to these words i harkened in vain reply i grew impatient i called aloud fortunato answer i called again fortunato answer still i thrust torch throug h the remaining aperture and let it fall within there came forth in return only jingli ng of the bells my heart grew n account of the dampness of the catacombs i hastened to make an end of my labor i forced the last stone into its position i plastered it up against the new masonry i reerected the old rampart of bones the half of century mortal has disturbed them in pace requiescat ii of ha wthorne and the shor t st or y 3 the reputation of the author of old tales has been conﬁned until very lately to literary society and i have not been wrong perhaps in citing him the example par excellence in this country of the privately admired and man of genius within the last year or two it is true an occasional critic has been urged by honest indignation into very warm approval webber 4 instance than whom one has keener relish that kind of writing which hawthorne has best illustrated gave us in late number of the american review cordial and certainly full tribute to his talents and since the issue of the mosses from an old manse criticisms of similar tone have been by means infrequent in our more authoritative journals i can call to mind few reviews of hawthorne published before the mosses one i remember in arcturus edited by matthews and duyckinck 5 may 1841 another in the american monthly edited by hoffman 6 and herbert march 1838 third in the number of the north american review these criticisms however seemed to have little effect on the popular least if we are to form any idea of the popular taste by reference to its expression in the newspapers or by the sale of the author book it was never the fashion until lately to speak of him in any summary of our best authors beyond doubt this inappreciation of him on the part of the public arose chieﬂy from the two causes to which i have the facts that he is neither man of wealth nor quack but these are insufﬁcient to account the whole effect small portion of it is attributable to the very marked idiosyncrasy of hawthorne himself in one sense and in great measure to be peculiar is to be original and than the true originality there is higher literary virtue this true or commendable originality however implie s not the uniform but the continuous peculiarity springing from vigor of still if from force of imagination giving its own hue its own character to everything it touches and especially to touch everything the pieces in the volumes entitled old tales are now in their third republication and of course are moreover they are by means all tales either in the ordinary or in the legitimate understanding of the term many of them are pure essays of the essays i must be content to speak in brief they are each and all 19 20 21 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume x of 10 index https without being characterized by the polish and adaptation so visible in the tales proper painter would at once note their leading or predominant feature and style it repose there is attempt at effect all is quiet thoughtful subdued yet this repose may exist simultaneously with high originality of thought and hawthorne has demonstrated the fact at every turn we meet with novel combinations yet these combinations never surpass the limits of the quiet we are soothed we read and withal is calm astonishment that ideas so apparently obvious have never occurred or been presented to us before herein our author differs materially from lamb or hunt or hazlitt with vivid originality of manner and expression have less of the true novelty of thought than is generally supposed and whose originality at best has an uneasy and meretricious quaintness replete with startling effects unfounded in nature and inducing trains of reﬂection which lead to satisfactory result the essays of hawthorne have much of the character of irving with more of originality and less of ﬁnish while compared with the spectator they have vast superiority at all points the spectator irving and hawthorne have in common that tranquil and subdued manner which i have chosen to denominate repose but in the ease of the two former this repose is attained rather by the absence of novel combination or of originality than otherwise and consists chieﬂy in the calm quiet unostentatious expression of commonplace thoughts in an unambitious unadulterated saxon in them by strong effort we are made to conceive the absence of all in the essays before the absence of effort is too obvious to be mistaken and strong undercurrent of suggestion runs continuously beneath the upper stream of the tranquil thesis in short these effusions of hawthorne are the product of truly imaginative intellect restrained and in some measure represt by fastidio usness of taste by constitutional melancholy and by indolence but it is of his tales that i desire princ ipally to speak the tale proper in my opinion affords unquestionably the fairest ﬁeld the exercise of the loftiest talent which can be afforded by the wide domains of mere prose were i bidden to say how the highest genius could be most advantageously employed the best display of its own powers i should answer without the composition of rimed poem not to exceed in length what might be perused in an hour within this limit alone can the highest order of true poetry exist i need only here say upon this topic that in almost all classes of composition the unity of effect or impression is point of the greatest importance it is clear moreover that this unity can not be thoroughly preserved in productions whose perusal can not be completed at one sitting we may continue the reading of prose composition from the very nature of prose itself much longer than we can persevere to any good purpose in the perusal of poem this latter if truly fulﬁlling the demands of the poetic sentiment induces an exaltation of the soul which can not be long sustained all high excitements are necessarily transient thus long poem is paradox and without unity of impression the deepest effects can not be brought about epics were the offspring of an imperfect sense of art and their reign is more poem too brief may produce vivid but never an intense or enduring impression without certain continuity of certain duration or repetition of soul is never deeply moved there must be the dropping of the water upon the rock béranger has wrought brilliant and like all impassive bodies they lack momentum and thus fail to satisfy the poetic sentiment they sparkle and excite but from want of continuity fail deeply to impress extreme brevity will degenerate into epigrammatism but the sin of extreme length is even more unpardonable in medio tutissimus ibis were i called upon however to designate that class of composition which next to such poem i have suggested should best fulﬁl the demands of high offer it the most advantageous ﬁeld of should unhesitatingly speak of the prose tale hawthorne has here exempliﬁed it i allude to the short prose narrative requiring from to one or two hours in its perusal of hawthorne tales we would say emphatically that they belong to the highest region of art subservient to genius of very lofty order we know of few 22 23 24 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume x of 10 index https which the critic can more honestly commend than these old tales americans we feel proud of the book hawthorne distinctive trait is invention creation imagination trait which in the literature of ﬁction is positively worth all the rest but the nature of the originality so far regards its manifestation in letters is but imperfectly understood the inventive or original mind frequently displays itself in novelty of tone in novelty of matter hawthorne is original in all points it would be matter of some difﬁculty to designate the best of these tales we repeat that without exception they are beautiful he has the purest style the ﬁnest taste the most available scholarship the most delicate humor the most touching pathos the most radiant imagination the most consummate ingenuity and with these varied

american review iii of willis br yant halleck and macaula y 7 whatever may be thought of willis talents there can be doubt about the fact that both an author and man he has made good deal of noise in the least an american his literary life in especial has been one continual emeute but then his literary character is modiﬁed or impelled in very remarkable degree by his personal one his success in point of fame if of nothing else he has certainly been successful is to be attributed to his mental ability and to his physical latter goading him into the accomplishment of what the form er merely gave him the means of accomplishing at very early age willis seems to have arrived at an understanding that in republic such ours the mere man of letters must ever be cipher and endeavored accordingly to unite the eclat of the litterateur with that of the man of fashion or of society he pushed himself went much into the world made friends with the gentler sex delivered poetical addresses wrote scriptural poems traveled sought the intimacy of noted women and got into quarrels with notorious men all these things served his indeed i am right in supposing that he had any purpose at all it is quite probable that before hinted he acted only in accordance with his physical temperament but be this it may his personal greatly advanced if it did not altogether establish his literary fame i have often carefully considered whether without the physique of which i speak there is that in the absolute morale of willis which would have earned him reputation man of letters and my conclusion is that he could not have failed to become noted in some degree under almost any circumstances but that about above stated of his appreciation by the public should be attributed to those adventures which grew immediately out of his animal constitution bryant position in the poetical world is perhaps better settled than that of any american there is less difference of opinion about his rank but usual the agreement is more decided in private literary circles than in what appears to be the public expression of sentiment gleaned from the press i may well observe here too that this coincidence of opinion in private circle s is in all cases very noticeable when compared 25 26 27 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume x of 10 index https the discrepancy of the apparent public opinion in private it is quite rare thing to ﬁnd any i mean of course about mere authorial merit it will never to claim bryant genius of the loftiest order but there has been latterly since the days of longfellow and lowell growing disposition to deny him genius in any respect he is now commonly spoken of man of high poetical talent very with warm appreciation of the beauty of nature and great descriptive powers but rather too much of the manner of cowper goldsmith and young this is the truth but not the whole truth bryant has genius and that of marked character but it has been overlooked by modern schools because deﬁcient in those externals which have become in measure symbolical of those schools the name of halleck is at least well established in the poetical world that of any american our principal poets are perhaps most frequently named in this bryant halleck dana sprague 8 longfellow willis and so coming second in the series but holding in fact rank in the public opinion quite equal to that of bryant the accuracy of the arrangement above made may indeed be questioned my own part i should have it bryant halleck willis sprague dana and estimating rather the poetic capacity than the poems actually accomplished there are three or four comparatively unknown writers whom i would place in the series between bryant and halleck while there are about dozen whom i should assign position between willis and sprague two dozen at least might ﬁnd room between sprague and latter i fear owing very large portion of his reputat ion to his quondam editorial connection with the north american review one or two poets now in my mind eye i should have hesitation in posting above even still not intending this very extravagant praise halleck in the apparent public estimate maintains somewhat better position than that to which on absolute grounds he is entitled there is something too in the bonhomie of certain of his something altogether distinct from poetic has aided to establish him and much also must be admitted on the score of his personal popularity which is deservedly great with all these allowances however there will still be found large amount of poetical fame to which he is fairly entitled personally he is man to be admired respected but more especially beloved his address has all the captivating bonhomie which is the leading feature of his poetry and indeed of his whole moral nature with his friends he is all ardor enthusiasm and cordiality but to the world at large he is reserved shunning society into which he is seduced only with difﬁculty and upon rare occasions the love of solitude seems to have become with him passion macaulay has obtained reputation which altho deservedly great is yet in remarkable measure undeserved the few who regard him merely terse forcible and logical writer full of thought and abounding in original views often sagacious and never otherwise than admirably to us precisely in the right the many who look upon him not only all this but comprehensive and profound thinker little prone to error err essentially themselves the source of the general mistake lies in very singular in one upon which we not remember ever to have heard word of comment we allude to tendency in the public mind toward logic logic liability to confound the vehicle with the aptitude to be so dazzled by the luminousness with which an idea is set forth to mistake it the luminousness of the idea itself the error is one exactly analogous with that which leads the immature poet to think himself sublime wherever he is obscure because obscurity is source of the confounding obscurity of expression with the expression of obscurity in the case of we may say en passant of our own assent to what he says too often because we so very clearly understand what it is that he intends to say comprehending vividly the points and the sequence of his argument we fancy that we are concurring in the argument itself it is not every mind which is at once able to analyze the satisfaction it receives from such essays we see here if it were merely beauty of style which they were they were remarkable only rhetorical would not be apt to

pretty soon they throw off their outside coat and the next minute another one and then the one under that and so they keep peeling off one garment after another till people begin to look queer and think they are going too far strict propriety well that is the way fellow with real practical turn serves good many of his scientiﬁc off other people to pick up and goes right at the work of curing and all the other little mean unscientiﬁc complaints that make up the larger part of every doctor business i think our benjamin is worthy young man and if you are in need of doctor at any time i hope you will go to him and if you come off without harm i some other friend to try him i thought he was going to say he would try him in his own person but the master is not fond of committing himself now i will answer your other question he said the lawyers are the cleverest men the ministers are the most learned and the doctors are the most sensible the lawyers are picked lot scholars and the like but their business is unsympathetic jack ketch there is nothing humanizing in their relations with their fellow creatures they go the side that retains them they defend the man they know to be rogue and not very rarely throw suspicion on the man they know to be innocent mind you i am not ﬁnding fault with side of case has right to the best statement it admits of but i say it does not tend to make them sympathetic suppose in case of fever patient the doctor should side with either party according to whether the old miser or his expectant heir was his employer suppose the minister should side with the lord or the devil according to the salary offered and other incidental advantages where the soul of sinner was in question you can see what piece of work it would make of their sympathies but the lawyers are quicker witted than either of the other professions and abler men generally they are or if they quarrel their quarrels are i think they are accomplished the ministers but they have way of cramming with special knowledge case which leaves certain shallow sediment of intelligence in their memories about good many things they are apt to talk law in mixt company and they have way of looking round when they make point if they were addressing jury that is mighty i once had occasion to see when one of and pretty famous one put on the witness stand at dinner party once the ministers come next in point of talent they are far more curious and widely interested outside of their own calling than either of the other professions i like to talk with they are interesting men full of good feelings hard workers always foremost in good deeds and on the whole the most efﬁcient civilizing downward from knowledge to ignorance that is not so much upward we have the trouble is that so many of work in harness and it is pretty sure to chafe somewhere they feed us on canned meats mostly they cripple our instincts and reason and give us crutch of doctrine i have talked with great many of of all sorts of belief and i think they are quite so easy in their minds the greater number of them nor so clear in their convictions one would think to hear lay down the law in the pulpit they used to lead the intelligence of their parishes now they pretty well if they keep up with it and they are very apt to lag behind it then they must have colleague the old minister thinks he can hold to his old course sailing right into the wind eye of human nature straight that famous old skipper john bunyan the young minister falls off three or four points and catches the breeze that left the old man sails all shivering the congregation will get ahead of him and then it must have another new skipper the priest holds his own pretty well the minister is coming down every 32 33 34 the project gutenberg

in northeaster and i thought it best to switch off the talk on to another rail how about the doctors i said theirs is the least learned of the professions in this country at least they have not half the general culture of the lawyers nor quarter of that of the ministers i rather think tho they are more agreeable to the common run of people than the men with the black coats or the men with green bags people can swear before if they want to and they ca very well before ministers i care whether they want to swear or not they want to be on their good behavior besides the minister has little smack of the sexton about him he comes when people are in extremis but they send him every time they make slight moral lie instance or smuggle silk dress through the but they call in the doctor when the child is cutting tooth or gets splinter in its ﬁnger so it does mean much to send him only pleasant chat about the news of the day putting the baby to rights does take long besides everybody does like to talk about the next world people are modest in their desires and ﬁnd this world good they deserve but everybody loves to talk physic everybody loves to hear of strange cases people are eager to tell the doctor of the wonderful cures they have heard of they want to know what is the matter with somebody or other who is said to be suffering from complication of disea ses and above all to get

i shall add few words of necessity almost epigrammatic upon his work and character he dealt with life and life with him was not merely this particular phase of being but the spiritual existence which included it like parenthesis between the two inﬁnities he wanted his daily drafts of oxygen like his neighbors and was thoroughly human the plain people he mentions who had successively owned or thought they owned the on which he planted his hearthstone but he was at home less in the interstellar spaces outside of all the atmospheres the idealism of milton was gross and clumsy medium compared to the imponderable ether of the over and the unimaginable vacuum of brahma he followed in the shining and daring track of the graius homo of lucretius vivida vis animi pervicit et extra processit

the ﬁrst spheroid he had been acquainted with by any means i have amused myself with comparing his descriptions of natural objects with those of the angel raphael in the seventh book of paradise lost emerson talks of his titmouse raphael talks of his emmet angels and poets never deal with nature after the manner of those whom we call naturalists to judge of him thinker emerson should have been heard lecturer his manner was an illustration of his way of thinking he would lose his place just his mind would drop its thought and pick up another twentieth cousin or relation at all to it this went so far at times that one could hardly tell whether he was putting together mosaic of colored fragments or only turning kaleidoscope where the pieces tumbled about they best might it was if he had been looking in at cosmic how and turning from it at brief intervals to tell us what he saw but what fragments these colored sentences were and what pictures they often placed before us if we too saw them never has this city known such audiences he gathered never was such an olympian entertainment that which he gave them it is very hard to speak of emerson poetry not to it injustice still more to it justice it seems to like the robe of monarch patched by new england housewife the royal tint and stuff are unmistakable but here and there the gray worsted from the crosses and ekes out the tyrian

neighbors hawthorne and emerson speech seemed like kind of travail to hawthorne one must harpoon him like cetacean with questions to make him talk at all then the words came from him at last with bashful manifestations like those of young girl that gasped themselves forth seeming to leave great deal more behind them than they told and died out discontented with themselves like the monologue of

followed him and the many who never knew and not know what hand it was which took down their prison walls he was preacher who taught that the religion of humanity included both those of palestine nor those alone and taught it with such consecrated lips that the narrowest bigot was ashamed to pray him from footstool nearer to the throne hitch your wagon to star this was his version of the divine lesson taught by that holy geor ge herbert whose words he loved give him whatever place belongs to him in our literature in the literature of our language of the world but remember this the end and

reenforcements and volunteers were perpetually arriving to the english ships until the battle had drifted quite out of reach of the town already in this ﬁrst small ﬁght the spaniards had learned

and dangerous between dunkirk and walcheren those ﬂeets of holland and zeeland numbering some one hundred and ﬁfty galleons sloops and under warmond nassau van der does moor and rosendael lay patiently blockading every possible egress from newport or gravelines or sluys or flushing or dunkirk and longing to grapple with the duke of parma so soon his ﬂeet of gunboats and hoys packed with his spanish and italian veterans should venture to set forth upon the sea their exploit it was pompous spectacle that midsummer night upon those narrow seas the moon which was at the full was rising

treacherous shallows dare to maintain their post now that the terrible holoferness with his invincible legions was resolved to come forth and the impatience of the soldiers and sailors on board the ﬂeet was equal to that of their commanders there was london almost before their huge mass of treasure richer and more accessible than those mines beyond the atlantic which had so often rewarded spanish chivalry with fabulous wealth and there were men in those galleons who remembered the sack of antwerp eleven years before men who could tell from personal experience how helpless was great commercial city when once in the clutch of disciplined brigands men who in that dread fury of antwerp had enriched themselves in an hour with the accumulations of merchant lifetime and who had slain fathers and mothers sons and daughte rs brides and bridegrooms before each other eyes until the number of inhabitants butchered in the blazing streets rose to many thousands and the plunder from palaces and warehouses was counted by millions before the sun had set on the great fury those spaniards and italians and walloons were now thirsting more gold more blood and the capital of england was even more wealthy and far more defenseless than the commercial metropolis of the netherlands had been so it was resolved that the london fury should be more thorough and more productive than the fury of antwerp at the memory of which the world still shuddered 80 81 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume x of 10 index https these professional soldiers had been taught to consider the english paciﬁc delicate effeminate race dependent on good living without experience of war quickly fatigued and discouraged and even more easily to be plundered and butchered than were the excellent bur ghers of antwerp and so these southern conquerors looked down from their great galleons and galeasses upon the english vessels more than of them were merchantmen there was comparison whatever between the relative strength of the ﬂeets in number they were about equal being each from one hundred and thirty to one hundred and ﬁfty strong but the spaniards had twice the tonnage of the english four times the artillery and nearly three times the number of men the twilight deepened the moon became totally obscured dark cloud masses spread over the heavens the sea grew black distant thunder rolled and the sob of an approaching tempest became distinctly audible such indications of westerly gale were not encouraging to those cumbrous vessels with the treacherous quicksands of flanders under their lee at an hour past midnight it was so dark that it was difﬁcult the most practised eye to pierce far into the gloom but faint drip of oars now struck the ears of the spaniards they watched from the decks few moments afterward the sea became suddenly luminous and six ﬂaming vessels appeared at slight distance bearing steadily down upon them before the wind and tide there were men in the armada who had been at the siege of antwerp only three years before they remembered with horror the of ﬂoating volcanoes which had seemed to rend earth and ocean whose explosion had laid so many thousands of soldiers dead at blow and which had shattered the bridge and ﬂoating forts of farnese tho they had been toys of glass they knew too that the famous engineer was at that moment in england in moment one of those horrible panics which spread with such contagious rapidity among large bodies of men seized upon the spaniards there was yell throughout the the of antwerp the of antwerp and in an instant every cable was cut and frantic attempts were made by each galleon and galeasse to escape what seemed imminent destruction the confusion was beyond description four or ﬁve of the largest ships became entangled with each other two others were set on ﬁre by the ﬂaming vessels and were consumed medina sidonia who had been warned even before his departure from spain that some such artiﬁce would probably be attempted and who had even early that morning sent out party of sailors in pinnace to search indications of the scheme was not surprized or dismayed he gave well might every ship after the danger should be passed was to return to its post and await his further orders but it was useless in that moment of unreasonable panic to issue commands the despised mantuan who had met with so many rebuf fs at philip court and to ofﬁcial been but partially successful in his magniﬁcent enterprise at antwerp had now by the mere terror of his name inﬂicted more damage on philip armada than had hitherto been accomplished by howard and drake hawkins and frobisher combined so long night and darkness lasted the confusion and uproar continued when the monday morning dawned several of the spanish vessels lay disabled while the rest of the ﬂeet was seen at distance of two leagues from calais driving toward the flemish coast the threatened gale had not yet begun to blow but there were fresh squalls from the which to such awkward sailors the spanish vessels were difﬁcult to contend with on the other hand the english ﬂeet were all astir and ready to pursue the

snug he prepared to send the yard down which was long and difﬁcult job frequently he was obliged to stop and hold on with all his might several minutes the ship pitching so to make it impossible to anything else at that height the yard at length came down safe and after it the fore and mizzen royal yards were sent down all hands were then sent aloft and an hour or two we were hard at work making

enough quick work without being cold and bright day it was sport to have gale in such weather this yet it blew like hurricane the wind seemed to come with spite an edge to it which threatened to scrape us off the yards the force of the wind was greater than i had ever felt it before but darkness cold and wet are the worst parts of storm to sailor having got on deck again we looked round to see what time of night it was and whose watch in few minutes the man at the wheel struck four bells and we found that the other watch was out and our own half out accordingly the starboard watch went below and left the ship to us couple of hours yet with orders to stand by call hardly had they got below before away went the foretopmast staysail blown to ribbons this was small sail which we could manage in the watch so that we were not obliged to call up the other watch we laid upon the bowsprit where we were under water half the time and took in the fragments of the sail and she must have some headsail on her prepared to bend another staysail we got the new one out into the nettings seized on the tack sheets and halyards and the hanks manned the halyards cut adrift the and hoisted away but before it was up the stay it was blown all to pieces when we belayed the halyards there was nothing left but the now large eyes began to show themselves in the foresail and knowing that it must soon go the mate ordered us upon the yard to furl it being unwilling to call up the watch who had been on deck all night he roused out the carpenter sailmaker cook and steward and with their help we manned the foreyard and after nearly half an hour struggle mastered the sail and got it well furled round the yard the force of the wind had never been greater than at this moment in going up the rigging it seemed absolutely to pin us down to the shrouds and on the yard there was such thing turning face to windward yet there was driving sleet and darkness and wet and cold off cape horn and instead of stiff oilcloth suits southwester caps and thick boots we had on hats round jackets duck trousers light shoes and everything light and easy these things make great difference to sailor when

that was doing better than any farmer in concord did that year the next year i did better still i spaded up all the land which i required about third of an acre and i learned from the experience of both years not being in the least awed by many celebrated works on husbandry arthur young among the rest that if one would live simply and eat only the crop which he raised and raise more than he ate and not exchange it an insufﬁcient quantity of more luxurious and expensive things he would need to cultivate only few rods of ground and that it would be cheaper to spade up that than to use oxen to plow it and to select fresh spot from time to time than to manure the old and he could all his necessary farm work it were with his left hand at odd hours in the summer and thus he would not be tied to an ox or horse or cow or pig at present i desire to speak impartially on this point and one not interested in the success or failure of the present economical and social arrangements i was more

had earned the expense of food eight months namely from july 4th to march 1st the time when these estimates were made tho i lived there more than two counting potatoes little green corn and some peas which i had raised nor considering the value of what was on hand at the last date was rice molasses cheapest form of the saccharine rye meal indian meal cheaper than rye pork flour costs more than

their deeds would look better in print the next year i sometimes caught mess of ﬁsh my dinner and once i went so far to slaughter woodchuck which ravaged my beanﬁeld his transmigration tartar would devour him partly experiment sake but tho it afforded momentary enjoyment notwithstanding musky ﬂavor i saw that the longest use would not make that good practise however it might seem to have your woodchucks ready drest by the village butcher clothing and some incidental expenses within the same date tho little can be inferred from this item amounted to oil and some household so that all the pecuniary outgoes excepting washing and mending which the most part were done out of the house and their bills have not yet been these are all and more than all the ways by which money necessarily goes out in this part of the house farm one year food eight clothing eight oil eight in all i address myself now to those of my readers who have living to get and to meet this i have farm produce sold

nearly the means with which i started and the measure of expenses to be on the other besides the leisure and independence and health thus secured comfortable house long i choose to occupy it these statistics however accidental and therefore uninstructive they may appear they have certain completeness have certain value also nothing was given of which i have not rendered some account it appears from the above estimate that my food alone cost in money about cents week it was nearly two years after this rye and indian meal without yeast potatoes rice very little salt pork molasses and salt and my drink water it was ﬁt that i should live on rice mainly who loved so well the philosophy of india to meet the objections of some inveterate cavillers i may well state that if i dined out occasionally i always had done and i trust shall have opportunities to again it was frequently to the detriment of my domestic arrangements but the dining out being i have stated constant element does not in the least af fect comparative statement like this i learned from my two years experience that it would cost incredibly little trouble to obtain one necessary food even in this latitude that man may use simple diet the animals and yet retain health and strength i have made satisfactory dinner satisfactory on several accounts simply off dish of purslane portulaca oleracea which i gathered in my cornﬁeld boiled and salted i give the latin on account of the savoriness of the trivial name and pray what more can reasonable man desire in peaceful times in ordinary noons than sufﬁcient number of ears of green boiled with the addition of salt even the little variety which i used was yielding to the demands of appetite and not of health yet men have come to such pass that they frequently starve not want of necessaries but want of luxuries and i know good woman who thinks that her son lost his life because he took to drinking water only the reader will perceive that i am treating the

and through the various fermentations thereafter till i came to good sweet wholesome bread the staf f of life more than ﬁve years i maintained myself thus solely by the labor of my hands and i found that by working about six weeks in year i could meet all the expenses of living the whole of my winters well most of my summers i had free and clear study i have thoroughly tried and found that my expenses were in proportion or rather out of proportion to my income i was obliged to dress and train not to say think and believe accordingly and i lost my time into the bargain i did not teach the good of my fellow men but simply livelihood this was failure i have tried trade but i found that it would take ten years to get under way in that and that then i should probably be on my way to the devil i was actually afraid that i might by that time be doing what is called good business when formerly i was looking about to see what i 108 109 110 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the

acquaintances went unhesitatingly into trade or the professions i contemplated this occupation most like theirs ranging the hills all summer to pick the berries which came in my way and thereafter carelessly dispose of them so to keep the ﬂocks of admetus i also dreamed that i might gather the wild herbs or carry evergreens to such villagers loved to be reminded of the woods even to the city by loads but i have since learned that trade curses everything it handles and tho you trade in messages from heaven the whole curse of trade attaches to the business in short i am convinced both by faith

an birds is like meat without seasoning such was not my abode i found myself suddenly neighbor to the birds not by having imprisoned one but having caged myself near them i was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the orchard but to those wilder and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never or rarely serenade villager the the veery the scarlet tanager the the whippoorwill and many others i was seated by the shore of small pond about mile and half south of the village of concord and somewhat higher than it in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and lincoln and about two miles south of that our only ﬁeld known to fame concord battle ground but i was so low in the woods that the opposite shore half mile off like the rest covered with wood was my most distant horizon the ﬁrst week whenever i looked out on the pond it imprest like tarn high up on the side of mountain its bottom far above the surface of other lakes and the sun arose i saw it throwing off its mighty clothing of mist and here and there by degrees its soft ripples or its smooth reﬂecting surface were revea led while the mists like ghosts were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle the very dew seemed to hang upon the trees later into the day than usual on the sides of mountains i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practise resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and to put to rout all that was not life to cut broad swath and shave close to drive life into corner and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and be able to give true account of it in my next excursion most men it appears to are in strange

without danger of dissipation or luxuriousness it implies that he in some measure emulates their heroes and consecrates morning hours to their pages the heroic books even if printed in the character of our mother tongue will always be in language dead to degener ate times and we must laboriously seek the meaning of each word and line conjecturing larger sense than common use permits out of that wisdom and valor and generosity we have the modern cheap and fertile press with all its translations has done little to bring us nearer to the heroic writers of antiquity they seem solitary and the letter in which they are printed rare and curious ever it is worth the expense of youthful days and costly hours if you learn only some words of an ancient language which are raised out of the trivialness of the street to be perpetual suggestions and provocation it is not in vain that the farmer remembers and repeats the few latin words which he has heard men sometimes speak if the study of the classics would at length make way more modern and practical studies but the adventurous student will always study classics in whatever language they may be written and however ancient they may be what are the classics but the noblest recorded thoughts of man they are the only oracles which are not decayed and there are such answers to the most modern inquiry in them delphi and dodona never gave we might well omit to study nature because she is old to read well that is to read true books in true spirit is noble exercise and one that will tax the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the day esteem it requires training such the athletes underwent the steady intention almo st of the whole life to this object books must be read deliberately and reservedly they were written it is not enough even to be able to speak the language of that nation by which 114 115 116 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume x of 10 index https are written there is memora ble interval between the spoken and the written language the language heard and the language read the one is commonly transitory sound tongue dialect merely almost brutish and we learn it unconsciously like the brutes of our mothers the other is the maturity and experience of that if that is our mother tongue this is our father tongue reserved and select expression too signiﬁcant to be heard by the ear which we must be born again in order to speak the crowds of men who merely spoke the greek and latin tongues in the middle ages were not entitled by the accident of birth to read the works of genius written in those languages these were not written in that greek or latin which they knew but in the select language of literature they had not learned the nobler dialects of greece and rome but the very materials on which they were written were waste paper to them and they prized instead cheap contemporary literature but when the several nations of europe had acquired distinct tho rude written languages of their own sufﬁcient the purposes of their rising literatures then ﬁrst learning revived and scholars were enabled to discern from that remoteness the treasures of antiquity what the roman and grecian multitude could not hear after the lapse of ages few scholars read and few scholars only are still reading it however much we may admire the orator occasional bursts of eloquence the noblest written words are commonly far behind or above the ﬂeeting spoken language the ﬁrmament with its stars is behind the clouds there are the stars and they who can may read them the astronomers forever comment on and observe them they are not exhalations like our daily colloquies and vaporous breath what is called eloquence in the forum is commonly found to be rhetoric in the study the orator yields to the inspiration of transient occasion and speaks to the mob before him to those who can hear him but the writer whose more equable life is his occasion and who would be distracted by the event and the crowd which inspire the orator speaks to the intellect and heart of mankind to all in any age who can understand him wonder that alexander carried the

illiterate and perhaps scornful trader has earned by enterprise and industry his coveted leisure and independence and is admitted to the circles of wealth and fashion he turns inevitably at last to those still higher but yet inaccessible circles of intellect and genius and is sensible only of the imperfection of his culture and the vanity and insufﬁciency of all his riches and further proves his good sense by the pains which he takes to secure his children that intellectual culture whose want he so keenly feels and thus it is that he becomes the founder of family those who have not learned to read the ancient classics in the language in which they were written must have very imperfect knowledge of the history of the human race it is remarkable that transcript of them has ever been made into any modern tongue unless our civilization itself may be regarded such transcript homer has never yet been printed in english nor æschylus nor virgil reﬁned solidly done and beautiful almost the

visitors have been there and left their cards either bunch of ﬂowers or wreath of evergreen or name in pencil on yellow walnut leaf or chip they who come rarely to the woods take some little piece of the forest into their hands to play with by the way which they leave either intentionally or accidentally one has peeled willow wand woven it into ring and dropt it on my table i could always tell if visitors had called in my absence either by the bended twigs or grass or the print of their shoes and generally of what sex or age or quality they were by some slight trace left ﬂower dropt or bunch of grass plucked and thrown away even far off the railroad half mile distant or by the lingering odor of cigar or pipe nay i was frequently notiﬁed of the passage of traveler along the highway sixty rods off by the scent of his pipe i have never felt lonesome or in the least opprest by sense of solitude but once and that was few weeks after i came to the woods when an hour i doubted if the near neighborhood of man was not essential to serene and healthy life to be alone was something unpleasant but i was at the same time conscious of slight insanity in my mood and seemed to foresee my recovery in the midst of gentle rain while these thoughts prevailed i was suddenly sensible of such sweet and beneﬁcent society in nature in the very pattering of the drops and in every sound and sight around my house an inﬁnite and unaccountable friendliness all at once like an atmosphere sustaining made the fancied advantages of human neighborhood signiﬁcant and i have never thought of them since every little pine needle expanded and swelled with sympathy and befriended i was so distinctly made aware of the presence of something kindred to even in scenes which we are accustomed to call wild and dreary and also that the nearest of blood to and humanest was not person nor villager that i thought place could ever be strange to again i ﬁnd it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time to be in company even with the best is soon wearisome and dissipating i love to be alone i never found the companion that was so companionable solitude we are the most part more lonely when we go abroad among men than when we stay in our chambers man thinking or working is always alone let him be where he will solitude is not measured by the miles of space that intervene between man and his fellows the really diligent student in one of the crowded hives of cambridge college is solitary dervish in the desert the farmer can work alone in the ﬁeld all day hoeing or chopping and not feel lonesome because he is employed but when he comes home at night he can not sit down in room alone at the mercy of his thoughts but must be where he can see the folks and recreate and he thinks remunerate himself his day solitude and hence he wonders how the student can sit alone in the house all night and most of the day without ennui and the blues but he does not realize that the student

morning when nobody calls let suggest few comparisons that some one may convey an idea of my situation i am more lonely than the loon in the pond that laughs so loud or than walden pond itself what company has that lonely lake i pray and yet it has not the blue devils but the blue angels in it in the azure tint of its waters the sun is alone except in thick weather when there sometimes appear to

fragment of the broken tables of god law and interpret it of its mighty import while philosophers are wrangling and politicians playing at snapdragon with the destinies of millions the poet in the silent deeps of his soul listens to those mysterious pulses which from one central heart send life and beauty through the ﬁnest veins of the universe and utters truths to be sneered at perchance by contemporaries but which become religion to posterity not unwisely ordered is that eternal destiny which renders the seer despised of men since thereby he is but the more surely taught to lay his head meekly upon the mother of nature and harken to the musical soft beating of her bounteous heart that poesy save she can soar nearer to the blissful throne of the supreme beauty is of more use than all other beautiful things are we are fain to grant that she does not add to the outward wealth of the body and that she is only so much more excellent than any bodily gift spirit is more excellent than matter we must also yield but inasmuch all beautiful things are direct messages and revelations of himself given us by our father and poesy is the searcher out and interpreter of all these tracing by her inborn sympathy the invisible nerves which bind them harmoniously together she is to be revered and cherished the poet has fresher memory of eden and of the path leading back thereto than other men so that we might almost deem him to have been conceived at least if not borne and nursed beneath the ambrosial shadow of those dimly remembered bowers and to have had his infant ears ﬁlled with the divine converse of angels who then talked face to face with his sires with beloved younger brethren and of whose golden words only the music remained to him vibrati ng forever in his soul and making him yearn to have all sounds of earth harmonize therewith in the poet lofty heart truth hangs her aerie and there love ﬂowers scattering thence her winged seeds over all the earth with every wind of heaven in all ages the poet ﬁery words have goaded men to remember and regain their ancient freedom and when they had regained it have tempered it with love of beauty so that it should accord with the freedom of nature and be unmovably eternal that the dreams of poets are morning dreams coming to them in the early dawn and daybreaking of great truths and are surel y fulﬁlled at last they

perhaps one stands on the whole so high he during his lifetime in spite of jealousy detraction unpopul ar politics and suspicious change of faith his preeminence was conceded he was the earliest complete type of the purely literary man in the modern sense there is singula r unanimity in allowing him certain claim to greatness which would be denied to men famous and more pope or swift example he is supposed in some way or other to have reformed english poetry it is now about half century since the only uniform edition of his works was edited by scott library is complete without him name is more familiar than his and yet it may be suspected that few writers are more thoroughly buried in that great cemetery of the british poets if contemporary reputation be often deceitful posthumous fame may be generally trusted it is verdict made up of the suffrages of the select men in succeeding generations this verdict has been good unanimous in favor of dryden it is perhaps worth while to take fresh observation of him to consider him neither warning nor example but to endeavor to make out what it is that has given so lofty and ﬁrm position to one of the most unequal inconsistent and faulty writers that ever lived he is curious example of what we often remark of the living but rarely of the that they get credit what they might be quite much what they posterity has applied to him one of his own rules of criticism judging him by the best rather than the average of his achievement thing posterity is seldom wont to on the 128 129 130 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume x of 10 index https side in politics it is true of his polemical writings of in many respects he resembles and especially in that supreme quality of reasoner that his mind gathers not only heat but clearness and expansion by its own they have won his battle him in the judgment of after times to us looking back at him he gradu ally becomes singularly interesting and even picturesque ﬁgure he is in more senses than one in language in turn of thought in style of mind in the direction of his activity the ﬁrst of the moderns he is the ﬁrst literary man who was also man of the world we understand the term he succeeded ben jonson the acknowledged dictator of wit and criticism johnson after nearly the same interval succeeded him all ages are in some sense ages of transition but there are times when the transition is more marked more rapid and it is perhaps an ill fortune man of letters to arrive at maturity during such period still more to represent in himself the change that is going on and to be an efﬁcient cause in bringing it about unless like goethe he is of singula rly uncontemporaneous nature capable of being tutta in romita and of running parallel with his time rather than being sucked into its current he will be thwarted in that harm onious development of native force which has so much to with its steady and successful application dryden suffered doubt in this way tho in creed he seems to have drifted backward in an eddy of the general current yet of the intellectual movement of the time so far certainly literature shared in it he could say with æneas not only that he saw but that himself was great part of it that movement was on the whole downward one from faith to scepticism from enthusiasm to cynicism from the imagi nation to the understanding it was in direction altogether away from those springs of imagination and faith at which they of the last age had slaked the thirst or renewed the vigor of their souls dryden himself recognized that indeﬁnable and gregarious inﬂuence which we call nowadays the spirit of the age when he said that every age has kind of universal genius he had also just notion of that in which he lived he remarks incidentally that all knowing ages are naturally sceptic and not at all bigoted which if i am not much deceived is the proper character of our own it may be conceived that he was even painfully of having fallen upon time incapable not merely of great poet but perhaps of any poet at all nothing is so sensitive to the chill of skeptical atmosphere that enthusiasm which if it be not genius is at least the beautiful illusion that saves it from the bafﬂing quibbles of consciousness thrice unhappy he who born to see things they might be is schooled by circumstances to see them people say they read god in prose translation such was dryden lot and such good part of his days it was by his own choice he who was of stature to snatch the torch of life that ﬂashes from lifted hand to hand along the generations over the heads of inferior men chose rather to be to the stews but at whatever period of his life we look at dryden and whatever the moment may have been his poetic creed there was something in the nature of the man that would not be wholly subdued to what it worked in there are continual glimpses of something in him greater than he hints of possibilities ﬁner than anything he has done you feel that the whole of him was better than any random specimens tho of his best seem to prove incessu patet he has by times the large stride of the elder race tho it sinks too often into the slouch of man who has seen better days his grand air may in part spring from habit of easy superiority to his competitors but must also in part be ascribed to an innate dignity of character that this preeminence should have been so generally admitted during his life can only be explained by bottom of good sense kindliness and sound judgment whose solid worth could afford that many ﬂurry of vanity petulance and even error should ﬂit across the surface and be forgotten whatever else dryden may have been the last and abiding impression of him is that he was thoroughly manly

arnold seems to think that shakespeare has damaged english poetry i wish he had it is true he lifted dryden above himself in all love but it was dryden who said of him by instinctive conviction rather than judgment that within his magic circle none dared tread but he is he to blame the extravagances of moder n diction which are but the reaction of the brazen age against the degeneracy of art into artiﬁce that has characterized the silver period in every literature we see in them only the futile effort of misguided persons to torture out of language the secret of that inspirati on which should be in themselves we not ﬁnd the extravagances in shakespeare himself we never saw line in any modern poet that reminded us of him and will venture to assert that it is only poets of the second class that ﬁnd successful imitators and the reason seems to us very plain one the genius of the great poet seeks repose in the expression of itself and ﬁnds it at last in style which is the establishment of perfect mutual understanding between the worker and his material the secondary intellect on the other hand seeks excitement in expression and stimulates itself into mannerism which is the wilful obtrusion of self style is its unconscious abnegation poet of the ﬁrst class has ever left school because his imagination is incommunicable while just surely the thermometer tells of the neighborhood of an iceber g you may detect the presence of genius of the second class in any generation by the inﬂuence of his mannerism that being an artiﬁcial thing is capable of reproduction dante shakespeare goethe left heirs either to the form or mode of their expression while milton sterne and wordsworth left behind them whole regiments uniformed with all their external characteristics we not mean that great poetic genius es may not have inﬂuenced thought tho we think it would be difﬁcult to show how shakespeare had done so directly and wilfully but that they have not infected contemporaries or followers with mannerism the quality in him which makes him at once so thoroughly english and so thoroughly cosmopolitan is that aeration of the understanding by the imagination which he has in common with all the greater poets and which is the privilege of genius the modern school which mistakes violence intensity seems to catch its breath when it ﬁnds itself on the verge of natural expression and to say to itself good heavens i had almost forgotten i was inspired but of shakespeare we not even suspect that he ever remembered it he does not always speak in that intense way that ﬂames up in lear and macbeth through the rifts of soil volcanic with passion he allows us here and there the repose of commonplace character the consoling distraction of humorous one he know s how to be equable and grand without effort so that we forget the altitude of thought to which he has led us because the slowly receding slope of mountain stretching downward by ample gradations gives less startling impression of height than to look over the edge of ravine that makes but wrinkle in its ﬂank shakespeare has been sometimes taxed with the barbarism of profuseness and exaggeration but this is to measure him by sophoclean scale the simplicity of the antique tragedy is by means that of expression but is of form merely in the utterance of great passions something must be indulged to the extravagance of nature the subdued tones to which pathos and sentiment are limited can not express tempest of the soul the range between the piteous more but so in which ophelia compresses the heartbreak whose compression was to make her mad and that sublime appeal of lear to the elements of nature only to be matched if matched at all in the prometheus is wide one and shakespeare is truly simple in the one in the other the simplicity of poetry is not that of prose nor its clearness that of ready apprehension merely to subtile sense sense heightened by sympathy those sudden fervors of phrase gone ere 134 135 136 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume x of 10 index https can say it lightens that show us macbeth groping among the complexities of thought in his mind and reveal the intricacy rather than enlighten it while they leave the eye darkened to the literal meaning of the words yet make their logical sequence the grandeur of the conception and its truth to nature clearer than sober daylight could there is an obscurity of mist rising from the undrained shallows of the mind and there is the darkness of thunder gathering its electric masses with passionate intensity from the clear element of the imagination not at random or wilfully but by the natural processes of the creative faculty to brood those ﬂashes of expression that transcend rhetoric and are only to be apprehended by the poetic instinct in that secondary ofﬁce of imagination where it serves the artist not the reason that shapes but the interpreter of his conceptions into words there is distinct ion to be noticed between the higher and lower mode in which it performs its function it may be either creative or pictorial may body forth the thought or merely image it forth with shakespeare example imagination seems immanent in his very consciousness with milton in his memory in the one it sends if without knowing it ﬁery life into the verse sei die braut wort bräutigam der geist in the other it elaborates certain pomp and elevation accordingly the bias of the former is toward of the latter toward shakespeare temptation is to push willing metaphor beyond its strength to make passion its tenement of words milton can not resist running simile on into fugue one always fancies shakespeare in his best verses and milton at the keyboard of his organ shakespeare language is longer the mere vehicle of thought it has become part of it its very ﬂesh and blood the pleasure it gives us is unmixt direct like that from the smell of ﬂower or the ﬂavor of fruit milton sets everywhere his little pitfalls of bookish association the memory i know that milton manner is very grand it is slow it is stately moving in triumphal procession with music with historic banners with spoils from every time and every region and captive epithets like huge sicambrians thrust their broad shoulders between us and the thought whose pomp they decorate but it is manner nevertheless is proved by the ease with which it is parodied by the danger it is in of degenerating into mannerism whenever it forgets itself fancy parody of not mean of his words but of his tone that is what distinguishes the master you might well try it with the venus of melos in shakespeare it is always the higher thing the thought the fancy that is preeminent it is cæsar that draws all eyes and not the

instruct others from the ﬁrst when child in his father log cabin lying upon the hearth that he might read by the ﬂickering ﬁrelight his attention was given almost exclusively to public and political affairs this determined his vocation journalist and he seems never to have felt any attraction toward any other of the intellectual professions he never had thought of being physician clergyman an engineer or lawyer private questions individual controversies had little concern him except they were connected with public interests politics and newspapers were his delight and he learned to be printer in order that he might become newspaper maker and after he was the editor of newspaper what chieﬂy engaged him was the discussion of political and social questions his whole greatness journalist was in this sphere the collection and digestion of news with the exception of election statistics he had great fondness and special ability he valued talent in that department only because he knew it was essential to the success of the newspaper he loved his own thoughts were always elsewhere accordingly there have been journalists who such strictly speaking have surpassed him minds not

adhere to his own line of action despite the excited appeals of friends and the menaces of variable public opinion and his constant purpose was to assert his principles to ﬁght them and present them to the public in the way most likely to give them the same hold upon other minds which they had upon his own in fact he was not so much journalist in the proper meaning of that term pamphleteer or writer of leading articles in this sphere of effort he had scarc ely an equal his command of language was extraordinary tho he had little imaginati on and his vocabulary was limited but he possest the faculty of expressing himself in racy virile manner within the apprehension of every reader he treated every topic in practical rather than philosophical spirit and with strong feeling rather than infallible logic so he never wrote above the heads of the public what he said was plain clear striking his illustrations were quaint and homely sometimes even vulgar but they never failed to tell he was gifted also with an excellent humor which greatly enlivened his writing in retort especially when provoke d he was dangerous to his antagonist and tho his reasoning might be faulty he would frequently gain his cause by ﬂash of wit that took the public and it were hustled his adversary out of court but he was not always victorious polemic his vehemence in controversy was sometimes too precipitate his prudence he would rush into ﬁght with his armor unfastened and with only part of the necessary weapons and the late washington hunt 44 once exprest it he could be more damaging to his

hatchet if they would guide him one of them accepted the offer and la salle prepared to set out in the morning at the same time directing joutel to be ready to go with him joutel says that evening while we were talking about what could have happened to the absent men he seemed to have presentiment of what was to take place he asked if i had heard of any machinations against them or if i had noticed any bad design on the part of duhaut and the rest i answered that i had heard nothing except that they sometimes complained of being found fault with so often and that this was all i knew besides which they were persuaded that i was in his interest they would not have told of any bad design they might have we were very uneasy all the rest of the evening in the morning la salle set out with his indian guide he had changed his mind with regard to joutel whom he now directed to remain in charge of the camp and to keep careful watch he told the friar anastase douay to come with him

show of respect replied in an agitated and broken voice but with tone of studied insolence that moranget was stroll ing about somewhere la salle rebuked and menaced him he rejoined with increased insolence drawing back he spoke toward the ambuscade while the incensed commander advanced to chastise him at that moment shot was ﬁred from the grass instantly followed by another and pierced through the brain la salle dropt dead the friar at his side stood terror unable to advance or to ﬂy when duhaut rising from the ambuscade called out to him to take courage he had nothing to fear the murderers

while he was yet boy flora of the sparkling eyes and the ringing voice his devotion was absolute flora was ﬂattered because all the girls i said worshiped him but she was gay glancing girl who had invaded the student heart with her audacious brilliancy and was that she had subdued it our cousin i never think of him my cousin away under the fervor of his passion his life exhaled an incense before her he wrote poems to her and sang them under her window in the summer moonlight he brought her ﬂowers and precious gifts when he had nothing else to give he gave her his love in homage so eloquent and beautiful that the worship was like the worship of the wise men the gay flora was proud and superb she was girl and the bravest and best boy loved her she was young and the wisest and truest youth loved her they lived together we all lived together in the happy valley of childhood we looked forward to manhood look across the sea believing that the whole world beyond is blest araby of spices the months went by and the young love continued our cousin and flora were only children still and there was engagement the elders looked upon the intimacy natural and mutually beneﬁcial it would help soften the boy and strengthen the girl and they took granted that softness and strength were precisely what were wanted it is great pity that men and women forget that they have been children parents are apt to be foreigners to their sons and daughters maturity is the gate of paradise which shuts behind us and our memories are gradually weaned from the glories in which our nativity was cradled the months went by the children grew older and they constantly loved now prue always smiles at one of my theories she is entirely skeptical of it but it is nevertheless my opinion that men love most passionately and women most permanently men love at ﬁrst and most warmly women love last and longest this is natural enough nature makes women to be won and men to win men are the active positive force and therefore they are more ardent and demonstrative why our cousin should have loved the gay flora so ardently was hard to say but that he did so was not difﬁcult to see he went

are romantic soldier is professionally hero says prue and foreigner is associated with all unknown and beautiful regions i hope there is worse reason our cousin came home and found flora and the young foreigner conversing the young foreigner had large soft black eyes and the dusky skin of the tropics his manner was languid and fascinating courteous and reserved it assumed natural supremacy and you felt if here were young prince traveling before he came into possession of his realm our cousin the curate sooner saw the tropical stranger and marked his impression upon flora than he felt the end the shaft struck his heart his smile was sweeter and his homage even more poetic and reverential i doubt if flora understood him or herself she did not know what he instinctively perceived that she loved him less but there are degrees in love when it is less than absolute and supreme it is nothing our cousin and flora were not formally engaged but their betrothal was understood by all of us thing of course he did not allude to the stranger but day followed day he saw with every nerve all that passed gradually that she scarcely noticed cousin left flora more and more with the stranger whom he saw she preferred his treatment of her was so full of tact he still walked and talked with her so familiarly that she was not troubled by any fear that he saw what she hardly saw herself therefore she was not obliged to conceal anything from him or from herself but all the soft currents of her heart were setting toward the west indian our cousin cheek grew paler and his soul burned and wasted within him his whole his dream of been founded upon his love it was stately palace built upon the sand and now the sand was sliding away i have read somewhere that love will sacriﬁce everything but itself but our cousin sacriﬁced his love to the happiness of his mistress he ceased to treat her peculiarly his own he made claim in word or manner that everybody might not have made he did not refrain from seeing her or speaking of her of all his other friends and at length altho one could say how or when the change had been made it was evident and understood that he was more her

secretly surprized that woman ceases to love him her love is heavenly favor won by desert of his if it passes he can more complain than ﬂower when the sunshine leaves it before our cousin left college flora was married to the tropical stranger it was the brightest of june days and the summer smiled upon the bride there were roses in her hand and orange ﬂowers in her hair and the village church bell rang out over the peaceful ﬁelds the warm sunshine lay upon the landscape like god blessing and prue and i not yet married ourselves stood at an open window in the old hand in hand while the young couple spoke their vows prue says that brides are always beautiful and i who remember prue herself upon her can i deny it truly the gay flora was lovely that summer morning and the throng was happy in the old church but it was very sad to altho i only suspected then what now i know i shed tears at my own wedding but i did at flora altho i knew she was marrying youth whom she dearly loved and who i doubt not dearly loved her among the group of her nearest friends was our cousin the curate when the ceremony was ended he came to shake her hand with the rest his face was calm and his smile sweet and his manner unconstrained flora did not should she shook his hand warmly and thanked him his good wishes then they all sauntered down the 186 187 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the

door and flora drove away i have never seen her since i not even know if she be living still but i shall always remember her she looked that june morning holding roses in her hand and wreathed with orange ﬂowers dear flora it was fault of hers that she loved one man more than another she could not be blamed not preferring our cousin to the west indian there is fault in the story it is only tragedy our cousin carried all the collegiate without exciting jealousy or envy he was so really the best that his companions were anxious he should have the sign of his superiority he studied hard he thought much and wrote well there was evidence of any blight upon his ambition or career but after living quietly in the country some time he went to europe and traveled when he returned he resolved to study law but presently relinquished it then he collected materials history but suffered them to lie unused somehow the mainspring was gone he used to come and pass weeks with prue and his coming made the children happy he sat with them and talked and played with them all day long one of themselves at length our cousin went abroad again to europe it was many years ago that we watched him sail away and when titbottom and prue and i went home to dinner the grace that was said that day was fervent prayer our cousin the curate many an evening afterward the children wanted him and cried themselves to sleep calling upon his name many an evening still our talk ﬂags into silence we sit before the ﬁre and prue puts down her knitting and takes my hand if she knew my thoughts altho we not name his name he wrote us letters he wandered about the world they were affectionate letters full of observation and thought and description he lingered longest in italy but he said his conscience accused him of yielding to the sirens and he declared that his life was running uselessly away at last he came to england he was charmed with everything and the climate was even kinder to him than that of italy he went to all the famous places and saw many of the famous englishmen and wrote that he felt england to be his home burying himself in the ancient gloom of university town altho past the prime of life he studied like an ambitious boy he said again that his life had been wine poured upon the ground and he felt guilty and so our cousin became curate our children have forgotten their old playmate but i am sure if there be any children in his parish over the sea they love our cousin the curate and watch eagerl y his coming does his step falter now i wonder is that long fair hair gray is that laugh musical in those distant homes it used to be in our nursery has england among all her great and good men any man so noble our cousin the curate the great book is unwritten the great deeds are undone in biographical dictionary will you ﬁnd the name of our cousin the curate is his life therefore lost have his powers been wasted i not dare to say it i see bourne on the pinnacle of prosperity but still looking sadly his castles in spain i see titbottom an old deputy bookkeeper whom nobody knows but with his chivalric heart loyal to children his generous and humane spirit full of sweet hope and faith and devotion i see the superb auriel so lovely that the indians would call her smile of the great spirit and beneﬁcent saint of the how shall i say what is lost and what is won i

belittling fame has become universal the air deeply rooted the hills the faint discords are not heard in the wide chorus that hails him second to none and equaled by washington alone the eulogies of him form special literature preachers poets soldiers and statesmen employ the same phrases of unconditional love and reverence men speaking with the authority of fame use unqualiﬁed superlatives it is not difﬁcult to perceive the basis of this sudden and fame nor rash to predict its indeﬁnite duration there are two classes of men whose names are more enduring than any monument the great writers and the men of great founders of states the conquerors lincoln has the singular fortune to belon g to both these categories upon these broad and stable foundations his renown is secur ely built nothing would have more amazed him while he lived than to hear himself called man of letters but this age has produced few greater writers we are only recording here the judgment of his peers emerson ranks him with æsop and pilpay in his lighter moods the more his writings are studied in connection with the important transactions of his age the higher will his reputation stand in the opinion of the lettered class but the men of study and research are never numerous and it is principally man of action that the world at large will regard him it is the story of his objective life that will forever touch and hold the heart of mankind his birth right was privation and peculiar to his family but the universal environment of his place and time he burst through those enchaining conditions by the force of native genius and will vice had temptation him his course was naturally upward the skylark he won against all conceivable obstacles high place in an exacting profession and an honorable position in public and private life he became the foremost representative of party founded on an uprising of the national conscience against secular wrong and thus came to the awful responsibilities of power in time of terror and gloom he met them with incomparable strength and virtue caring nothing but the public good free from envy or jealous 214 215 216 the project gutenberg ebook of the best

his own party in congress and bitterly denounced and malign ed by his open adversaries he yet bore himself with such extraordinary discretion and skill that he obtained the government all the

immediate and wide fame his possession of certain moral qualities rarely combined in such high degree in one individual his heart was so tender that he would dismount from his horse in forest to replace in their nest young birds which had fallen by the roadside he could not sleep at night if he knew that soldier was under sentence of death he could not even at the bidding of duty or policy refuse the prayer of age or helplessness in distress children instinctively loved him they never found his rugged features ugly his sympathies were quick and seemingly unlimited he was absolutely without prejudice of class or condition frederick douglass says he was the only man of distinction he ever met who never reminded him by word or manner of his color he was just and generous to the rich and to the poor and thing rare among politicians he was tolerant even of evil tho man can ever have lived with loftier scorn of meanness and selﬁshness he yet recognized their existence and counted with them he said one day with ﬂash of cynical wisdom worthy of la rochefoucauld that honest statesmanship was the employment of individual meanness the public good he never asked perfection of any one he did not even insist others upon the high standards he set up himself at time before the word was invented he was the ﬁrst of opportunists with the ﬁre of reformer and martyr in his heart he yet proceeded by the ways of cautious and practical statecraft he always worked with things they were while never relinquishing the desire and effort to make them better to hope which saw the delectable mountains of absolute justice and peace in the future to faith that god in his own time would give to all men the things convenient to them he added charity which embraced in its deep bosom all the good and the bad all the virtues and the inﬁrmities of men and patience like that of nature which in its vast and fruitful activity knows neither haste nor rest character like this is among

sensitive child sympathy and love left ofﬁce strongly and almost generally disliked the least popular president who preceded or followed him he had undertaken to create government which should interfere in way with private action and he had created one which interfered directly in the concerns of every private citizen in the land he had come into power the champion of state rights and had driven states to the verge of armed resistance he had begun by claiming credit stern economy and ended by exceeding the expenditure of his predecessors he had invented policy of peace and his invention resulted in the necessity of ﬁghting at once the two greatest powers in the world in truth the disaster was appalling and jefferson described it in moderate terms by admitting that the policy of peaceable coercion brought upon him mortiﬁcation such other president ever suffered so complete was his overthrow that his popular inﬂuence declined even in the south twenty years elapsed before his political authority recovered power over the northern people not until the embar go and its memories faded from men minds did the mighty shadow of jefferson revolutionary name efface the

and sardonic purely mechanical spasm quite independent of any mirthful to this day i am doubtful whether i ever saw chinaman laugh theatrical representation by natives one might think would have set my mind at ease on this point but it did not indeed new difﬁculty presented impossibility of determining whether the performance was tragedy or farce i thought i detected the low comedian in an active youth who turned two somersaults and knocked everybody down on entering the stage but unfortunately even this classic resemblance to the legitimate farce of our civilization was deceptive another brocaded actor who represented the hero of the play turned three somersaults and not only upset my theory and his fellow actors at the same time but apparently ran amuck behind the scenes some time afterward i looked around at the glinting white teeth to observe the effect of these two palpable hits they were received with equal acclamation and apparently equal facial spasms one or two beheadings which enlivened the play produced the same sardonic effect and left upon my mind painful anxiety to know what was the serious business of life in china it was noticeab le however that my

walk off the stage can not be said to have remarkable perceptions of the ludicrous i have often been struck with the delica pliability of the chinese expression and taste that might suggest broader and deeper criticism than is becoming these pages chinaman will adopt the american costume and wear it with taste of color and detail that will surpass those native and to the manner born to look at chinese slipper one might imagine it impossible to shape the original foot to anything less cumbrous and roomy yet neater boot than that belonging to the americanized chinaman is rarely seen on this

northern invader and even wears the livery of his conqueror with wild and buttonless freedom the chinaman abused and degraded he is changes by correctly graded transition to the garments of christian civilization there is but one article of european wear that he avoids these bohemian eyes have never yet been pained by the spectacle of tall hat on the head of an intelligent chinaman my acquaintance with john has been made up of weekly interviews involving the adjustment of the washing accounts so that i have not been able to study his character from social viewpoint or observe him in the privacy of the domestic circle i have gathered enough to justify in believing him to be generally honest faithful simple and painstaking of his simplicity let record an instance where sad and civil young chinaman brought certain shirts with most of the buttons missing and others hanging on delusively by single thread in moment of unguarded irony i informed him that unity would at least have been preserved if the buttons were removed altogether he smiled sadly and went away i thought i had hurt his feelings until the next week when he brought my shirts with look of intelligence and the buttons carefully and totally erased at another time to guard against his general disposition to carry off anything soiled clothes that he thought could hold water i requested him to always wait until he saw coming home late one evening i found the household in great consternation over an immovable celestial who had remained seated on the front during the day sad and submissive ﬁrm but also patient and only betraying any animation or token of his mission when he saw coming this same chinaman evinced some evidences of regard little girl in the family who in her turn reposed such faith in his intellectual qualities to present him with prete rnaturally uninteresting book her own property this book john made point of carrying ostentatiously with him in his weekly visits it appeared usually on the top of the clean clothes and was sometimes painfully clasped outside of the big bundle of soiled linen whether john believed he unconsciously imbibed some spiritual life through its pasteboard cover the prince in the arabian nights imbibed the medic ine through the handle of the mallet or whether he wished to exhibit due sense of gratitude or whether he had any pockets i have never been able to ascertain in his turn he would sometimes cut marvelous imitation roses from carrots his little friend i am inclined to think that the few roses strewn in john path were such scentless imitations the thorns only were real from the persecutions of the young and old of certain class his life was torment i know what was the exact philosophy that confucius taught but it is to be hoped that poor john in his persecution is still able to detect the conscious hate and fear with which inferiority always regards the possibility of justice and which is the keyno to the vulgar clamor about
