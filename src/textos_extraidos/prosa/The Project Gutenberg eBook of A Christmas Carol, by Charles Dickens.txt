burial was signed by the clergyman the clerk the undertaker and the chief mourner scrooge signed it and scrooge s name was good upon change anything he chose to put his hand to old marley was dead door mind i don t mean to say that i know of my own knowledge what there is particularly dead about nail i might have been inclined myself to regard nail the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade but the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it or the country s done you will therefore permit to repeat emphatically that marley was dead door scrooge knew he was dead of course he did how could it be otherwise scrooge and he were partners i don t know how many years scrooge was his sole executor his sole administrator his sole assign his sole residuary legatee his sole friend and sole mourner and even scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral and solemnised it with an undoubted bar gain the mention of marley s funeral bring s back to the point i started from there is doubt that marley was dead this must be distinctly understood or nothing wonderful can come of the story i am going to relate if we were not perfectly convinced that hamlet s father died before the play began there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking stroll at night in an easterly wind upon his own ramparts than there would be in any other gentleman rashly turning out after dark in breezy saint paul s churchyard literally to astonish his son s weak mind scrooge never painted out old marley s name there it stood years afterwards above the warehouse door scrooge and marley the ﬁrm was known scrooge and marley sometimes people new to the business called scrooge scrooge and sometimes marley but he answered to both names it was all the same to the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https but he was hand at the grindstone scrooge squeezing wrenching grasping scraping clutching covetous old sinner hard and sharp ﬂint from which steel had ever struck out generous ﬁre secret and and solitary an oyster the cold within him froze his old features nipped his pointed nose shrivelled his cheek stiffened his gait made his eyes red his thin lips blue and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice frosty rime was on his head and on his eyebrows and his wiry chin he carried his own low temperature always about with him he iced his ofﬁce in the and didn t thaw it one degree at christmas external heat and cold had little inﬂuence on scrooge warmth could warm wintry weather chill him wind that blew was bitterer than he falling snow was more intent upon its purpose pelting rain less open to entreaty foul weather didn t know where to have him the heaviest rain and snow and hail and sleet could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect they often came down handsomely and scrooge never did nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with gladsome looks my dear scrooge how are you when will you come to see beggars implored him to bestow triﬂe children asked him what it was clock man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such place of scrooge even the blind men s dogs appeared to know him and when they saw him coming on would tug their owners into doorways and up courts and then would wag their tails though they said eye at all is better than an evil eye dark master but what did scrooge care it was the very thing he liked to edge his way along the crowded paths of life warning all human sympathy to keep its distance was what the knowing ones call nuts to scrooge once upon all the good days in the year on christmas scrooge sat busy in his house it was cold bleak biting weather foggy withal and he could hear the people in the court outside go wheezing up and down beating their hands upon their breasts and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them the city clocks had only just gone three but it was quite dark had not been light all candles were ﬂaring in the windows of the neighbouring ofﬁces like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air the fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole and was so dense without that although the court was of the narrowest the houses opposite were mere phantoms to see the dingy cloud come drooping down obscuring everything one might have thought that nature lived hard by and was brewing on lar ge scale the door of scrooge s was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk who in dismal little cell beyond sort of tank was copying letters scrooge had very small ﬁre but the clerk s ﬁre was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal but he couldn t replenish it scrooge kept the in his own room and so surely the clerk came in with the shovel the master predicted the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https would be necessary them to part wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter and tried to warm himself at the candle in which effort not being man of strong imagination he failed merry christmas uncle god save you cried cheerful voice it was the voice of scrooge s nephew who came upon him so quickly that this was the ﬁrst intimation he had of his approach bah said scrooge humbug he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost this nephew of scrooge s that he was all in glow his face was ruddy and handsome his eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again christmas humbug uncle said scrooge s nephew you don t mean that i am sure i said scrooge merry christmas what right have you to be merry what reason have you to be merry you re poor come then returned the nephew gaily what right have you to be dismal what reason have you to be morose you re rich scrooge having better answer ready on the spur of the moment said bah again and followed it up with don t be cross uncle said the nephew what else can i be returned the uncle when i live in such world of fools this merry christmas out upon merry christmas what s christmas time to you but time paying bills without money time ﬁnding yourself year older but not an hour richer time balancing your books and having every item in through round dozen of months presented dead against you if i could work my will said scrooge indignantly every idiot who goes about with merry christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with stake of holly through his heart he should uncle pleaded the nephew nephew returned the uncle sternly keep christmas in your own way and let keep it in keep it repeated scrooge s nephew but you don t keep let leave it alone then said scrooge much good may it you much good it has ever done you there are many things from which i might have derived good by which i have not proﬁted i dare say returned the nephew christmas among the rest but i am sure i have always thought of christmas time when it has come round from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin if anything belonging to it can be apart from good time kind forgiving charitable pleasant time the only time i know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one consent to open their hearts freely and to think of people below them if they really were to the grave and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys and the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https though it has never put scrap of gold or silver in my pocket i believe that it has done good and will good and i say god

scrooge and you ll keep your christmas by losing your situation you re quite powerful speaker sir he added turning to his nephew i wonder you don t go into don t be angry uncle come dine with us scrooge said that he would see indeed he did he went the whole length of the expression and said that he would see him in that extremity ﬁrst but why cried scrooge s nephew why why did you get married said scrooge because i fell in because you fell in love growled scrooge if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than merry christmas good afternoon nay uncle but you never came to see before that happened why give it reason not coming now good afternoon said scrooge i want nothing from you i ask nothing of you why can not we be friends good afternoon said scrooge i am sorry with all my heart to ﬁnd you so resolute we have never had any quarrel to which i have been party but i have made the trial in homage to christmas and i ll keep my christmas humour to the last so merry christmas uncle good afternoon said scrooge and happy new year good afternoon said scrooge his nephew left the room without an angry word notwithstanding he stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk who cold he was was warmer than scrooge he returned them cordially there s another fellow muttered scrooge who overheard him my clerk with ﬁfteen shillings week and wife and family talking about merry christmas i ll retire to this lunatic in letting scrooge s nephew out had let two other people in they were portly gentlemen pleasant to behold and now stood with their hats off in scrooge s ofﬁce they had books and papers in their hands and bowed to him scrooge and marley s i believe said one of the gentlemen referring to his list have i the pleasure of addressing mr scrooge or mr marley mr marley has been dead these seven years scrooge replied he died seven years ago this very the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https we have doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner said the gentleman presenting his credentials it certainly was they had been two kindred spirits at the ominous word liberality scrooge frowned and shook his head and handed the credentials back at this festive season of the year scrooge said the gentleman taking up pen it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision the poor and destitute who suffer greatly at the present time many thousands are in want of common necessaries hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts are there prisons asked scrooge plenty of prisons said the gentleman laying down the pen again and the union workhouses demanded scrooge are they still in operation they are still returned the gentleman i wish i could say they were the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then said scrooge both very busy oh i was afraid from what you said at ﬁrst that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course said scrooge i m very glad to hear under the impression that they scarcely furnish christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude returned the gentleman few of us are endeavo uring to raise fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth we choose this time because it is time of all others when want is keenly felt and abundance rejoices what shall i put you down nothing scrooge replied you wish to be anonymous i wish to be left alone said scrooge since you ask what i wish gentlemen that is my answer i don t make merry myself at christmas and i can t afford to make idle people merry i help to support the establishments i have cost enough and those who are badly off must go many can t go there and many would rather if they would rather die said scrooge they had better it and decrease the surplus population don t know but you might know it observed the gentleman it s not my business scrooge returned it s enough man to understand his own business and not to interfere with other people mine occupies constantly good afternoon gentlemen seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point the gentlemen withdrew scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himse lf and in more facetious temper than was usual with the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https the fog and darkness thickened so that people ran about with ﬂaring links proffering their services to go before horses in carriages and conduct them on their way the ancient tower of church whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at scrooge out of gothic window in the wall became invisible and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds with tremulous vibrations afterwards if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there the cold became intense in the main street at the corner of the court some labourers were repairing the pipes and had lighted great ﬁre in brazier round which party of ragged men and boys were gathered warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture the water being left in solitude its overﬂowings sullenly congealed and turned to misanthropic ice the brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the window s made pale faces ruddy they passed poulterers and grocers trades became splendid joke glorious pageant with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles bargain and sale had anything to the lord mayor in the stronghold of the mighty mansion hous gave orders to his ﬁfty cooks and

energy of action that the singer ﬂed in terror leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost at length the hour of shutting up the arrived with an scrooge dismounted from his stool and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the tank who instantly snuffed his candle out and put on his hat you ll want all day i suppose said scrooge if quite convenient sir it s not convenient said scrooge and it s not fair if i was to stop it you d think yourself used i ll be bound the clerk smiled faintly and yet said scrooge you don t think when i pay day s wages the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https clerk observed that it was only once year poor excuse picking man s pocket every ﬁfth of december said scrooge buttoning his to the chin but i suppose you must have the whole day be here all the earlier next the clerk promised that he would and scrooge walked out with growl the ofﬁce was closed in twinkling and the clerk with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist he boasted went down slide on cornhill at the end of lane of boys twenty times in honour of its being christmas eve and then ran home to camden town hard he could pelt to play at blindman scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern and having read all the newspapers and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker went home to bed he lived in chamb ers which had once belonged to his deceased partner they were gloomy suite of rooms in lowering pile of building up yard where it had so little business to be that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was young house playing at with other houses and forgotten the way out again it was old enoug h now and dreary enough nobody lived in it but scrooge the other rooms being all let out ofﬁces the yard was so dark that even scrooge who knew its every stone was fain to grope with his hands the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed if the genius of the weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold now it is fact that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door except that it was very large it is also fact that scrooge had seen it night and morning during his whole residence in that place also that scrooge had little of what is called fancy about him any man in the city of london even is bold the corporation aldermen and livery let it also be borne in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one thought on marley since his last mention of his seven years dead partner that afternoon and then let any man explain to if he can how it happened that scrooge having his key in the lock of the door saw in the knocker without its under going any intermediate process of t knocker but marley s face marley s face it was not in impenetrable shadow the other objects in the yard were but had dismal light about it like bad lobster in dark cellar it was not angry or ferocious but looked at scrooge marley used to look with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead the hair was curiously stirred if by breath or hot air and though the eyes were wide open they were perfectly motionless that and its livid colour made it horrible but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control rather than part of its own expression scrooge looked ﬁxedly at this phenomenon it was knocker the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https say that he was not startled or that his blood was not conscious of terrible sensation to which it had been stranger from infancy would be untrue but he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished turned it sturdily walked in and lighted his candle he did pause with moment s irresolution before he shut the door and he did look cautiously behind it ﬁrst if he half expected to be terriﬁed with the sight of marley s pigtail sticking out into the hall but there was nothing on the back of the door except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on so he said pooh pooh and closed it with bang the sound resounded through the house like thunder every room above and every cask in the s cellars below appeared to have separate peal of echoes of its own scrooge was not man to be frightened by echoes he fastened the door and walked across the hall and up the stairs slowly too trimming his candle he went you may talk vaguely about driving up good old ﬂight of stairs or through bad young act of parliament but i mean to say you migh t have got hearse up that staircase and taken it broadwise with the splinter bar towards the wall and the door towa rds the balustrades and done it easy there was plenty of width that and room to spare which is perhaps the reason why scrooge thought he saw locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom out of the street wouldn t have lighted the entry too well so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with scrooge s dip up scrooge went not caring button that darkness is cheap and scrooge liked it but before he shut his heavy door he walked through his rooms to see that all was right he had just enough recollection of the face to desire to that bedroom lumber all they should be nobody under the table nobody under the sofa small ﬁre in the grate spoon and basin ready and the little saucepan of gruel scrooge had cold in his head upon the hob nobody under the bed nobody in the closet nobody in his which was hanging up in suspicious attitude against the wall lumber usual old guard old shoes two on three legs and poker quite satisﬁed he closed his door and locked himself in himself in which was not his custom thus secured against surprise he took off his cravat put on his and slippers and his nightcap and sat down before the ﬁre to take his gruel it was very low ﬁre indeed nothing on such bitter night he was obliged to sit close to it and brood over it before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such handful of fuel the ﬁreplace was an old one built by some dutch merchant long ago and paved all round with quaint dutch tiles designed to illustrate the scriptures there were cains and abels pharaoh s daughters queens of sheba angelic messengers descending through the air the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https like feather abrahams belshazzars apostles putting off to sea in butter hundreds of ﬁgures to attract his thoughts and yet that face of marley seven years dead came like the ancient prophet s rod and swallowed up the whole if each smooth tile had been blank at ﬁrst with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts there would have been copy of old marley s head on every one humbug said scrooge and walked across the room after several turns he sat down again he threw his head back in the chair his glance happ ened to rest upon bell disused bell that hung in the room and communicated some purpose now forgotten with chamber in the highest story of the building it was with great astonishment and with strange inexplicable dread that he looked he saw this bell begin to swing it swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made sound but soon it rang out loudly and so did every bell in the house this might have lasted half minute or minute but it seemed an hour the bells ceased they had begun together they were succeeded by clanking noise deep down below if some person were dragging heavy chain over the casks in the s cellar scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described dragging chains the cellar ﬂew open with booming sound and then he heard the noise much louder on the ﬂoors below then coming up the stairs then coming straight towards his door it s humbug still said scrooge i won t believe his colour changed though when without pause it came on through the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes upon its coming in the dying ﬂame leaped up though it cried i know him marley s ghost and fell the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https s ghost the same face the very same marley in his pigtail usual waistcoat tights and boots the tassels on the latter bristling like his pigtail and his and the hair upon his head the chain he drew was clasped about his middle it was long and wound about him like tail and it was made scrooge observed it closely of keys padlocks ledgers deeds and heavy purses wrought in steel his body was transparent so that scrooge observing him and looking through his waistcoat could see the two buttons on his coat behind scrooge had often heard it said that marley had bowels but he had never believed it until now nor did he believe it even now though he looked the phantom through and through and saw it standing before him though he felt the chilling inﬂuence of its eyes and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin which wrapper he had not observed before he was still incredulous and fought against his senses how now said scrooge caustic and cold ever what you want with much s voice doubt about it who are you ask who i the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https who were you then said scrooge raising his voice you re particular he was going to say to shade but substituted this more appropriate in life i was your partner jacob marley can you sit down asked scrooge looking doubtfully at him i it scrooge asked the question because he didn t know whether ghost so transparent might ﬁnd himself in condition to take chair and felt that in the event of its being impossible it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation but the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the ﬁreplace if he were quite used to it you don t believe in observed the ghost i don t said scrooge what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses i don t know said scrooge why you doubt your senses because said scrooge little thing affects them slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats you may be an undigested bit of beef blot of mustard crumb of cheese fragment of an underdone potato there s more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you are scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes nor did he feel in his heart by any means waggish then the truth is that he tried to be smart means of distracting his own attention and keeping down his terror the spectre s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones to sit staring at those ﬁxed glazed eyes in silence moment would play scrooge felt the very deuce with him there was something very awful too in the spectre s being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own scrooge could not feel it himself but this was clearly the case though the ghost sat perfectly motionless its hair and skirts and tassels were still agitated by the hot vapour from an oven you see this toothpick said scrooge returning quickly to the charge the reason just assigned and wishing though it were only second to divert the vision s stony gaze from himself i replied the ghost you are not looking at it said scrooge but i see it said the ghost well returned scrooge i have but to swallow this and be the rest of my days persecuted by legion of goblins all of my own creation humbug i tell you humbug at this the spirit raised frightful cry and shook its chain with such dismal and appalling noise that scrooge held on tight to his chair to save himself from falling in swoon but how much greater was his horror when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head if it were too the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https wear indoors its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast scrooge fell upon his knees and clasped his hands before his face mercy he said dreadful apparition why you trouble man of the worldly mind replied the ghost you believe in or not i said scrooge i must but why spirits walk the earth and why they come to it is required of every man the ghost returned that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen and travel far and wide and if that spirit goes not forth in life it is condemned to so after death it is doomed to wander through the woe is witness what it can not share but might have shared on earth and turned to happiness again the spectre raised cry and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands you are fettered said scrooge trembling tell why i wear the chain i forged in life replied the ghost i made it link by link and yard by yard i girded it on of my own free will and of my own free will i wore it is its pattern strange to you scrooge trembled more and more or would you know pursued the ghost the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself it was full heavy and long this seven christmas eves ago you have laboured on it since it is ponderous chain scrooge glanced about him on the ﬂoor in the expectation of ﬁnding himself surrounded by some ﬁfty or sixty fathoms of iron cable but he could see nothing jacob he said imploringly old jacob marley tell more speak comfort to jacob i have none to give the ghost replied it comes from other regions ebenezer scrooge and is conveyed by other ministers to other kinds of men nor can i tell you what i would very little more is all permit ted to i can not rest i can not stay i can not linger anywh ere my spirit never walked beyond our life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our changing hole and weary journeys lie before it was habit with scrooge whenever he became thoughtful to put his hands in his breeches pockets pondering on what the ghost had said he did so now but without lifting up his eyes or getting of f his knees you must have been very slow about it jacob scrooge observed in manner though with humility and deference slow the ghost repeated seven years dead mused scrooge and travelling all the time the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https the whole time said the ghost rest peace incessant torture of you travel fast said scrooge on the wings of the wind replied the ghost you might have got over great quantity of ground in seven years said scrooge the ghost on hearing this set up another cry and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night that the ward would have been justiﬁed in indicting it nuisance oh captive bound and cried the phantom not to know that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptib le is all developed not to know that any christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere whatever it may be will ﬁnd its mortal life too short its vast means of usefulness not to know that space of regret can make amends one life s opportunity misused yet such was i oh such was i but you were always good man of business jacob faltered scrooge who now began to apply this to himself business cried the ghost wringing its hands again mankind was my business the common welfare was my business charity mercy forbearance and benevolence were all my business the dealings of my trade were but drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business it held up its chain at arm s length if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief and ﬂung it heavily upon the ground again at this time of the rolling year the spectre said i suffer most why did i walk through crowds of beings with my eyes turned down and never raise them to that blessed star which led the wise men to poor abode were there poor homes to which its light would have conducted scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate and began to quake exceedingly hear cried the ghost my time is nearly i will said scrooge but don t be hard upon don t be ﬂowery jacob pray how it is that i appear before you in shape that you can see i may not tell i have sat invisib le beside you many and many day it was not an agreeable idea scrooge shivered and wiped the perspiration from his brow that is light part of my penance pursued the ghost i am here to warn you that you have yet chance and hope of escaping my fate chan ce and hope of my procuring ebenezer you were always good friend to said scrooge thank ee you will be haunted resumed the ghost by three the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https s countenance fell almost low the ghost s had done is that the chance and hope you mentioned jacob he demanded in faltering voice it think i d rather not said scrooge without their visits said the ghost you can not hope to shun the path i tread expect the ﬁrst when the bell tolls couldn t i take all at once and have it over jacob hinted scrooge expect the second on the next night at the same hour the third upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate look to see more and look that your own sake you remember what has passed between us when it had said these words the spectre took its wrapper from the table and bound it round its head before scrooge knew this by the smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the bandage he ventured to raise his eyes again and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude with its chain wound over and about its arm the apparition walked backward from him and at every step it took the window raised itself little so that when the spectre reached it it was wide open it beckoned scrooge to approach which he did when they were within two paces of each other marley s ghost held up its hand warning him to come nearer scrooge stopped not so much in obedience in surprise and fear on the raising of the hand he became sensible of confused noises in the air incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and the spectre after listening moment joined in the mournful dir ge and ﬂoated out upon the bleak dark night scrooge followed to the window desperate in his curiosity he looked out the air was ﬁlled with phantoms wandering hither and thither in restless haste and moaning they went every one of them wore chains like marley s ghost some few they might be guilty governments were linked together none were free many had been personally known to scrooge in their lives he had been quite familiar with one old ghost in white waistcoat with monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle who cried piteously at being unable to assist wretched woman with an infant whom it saw below upon the misery with them all was clearly that they sought to interfere good in human matters and had lost the power ever the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https these creatures faded into mist or mist enshrouded them he could not tell but they and their spirit voices faded together and the night became it had been when he walked home scrooge closed the window and examined the door by which the ghost had entered it was he had locked it with his own hands and the bolts were undisturbed he tried to say humbug but stopped at the ﬁrst syllable and being from the emotion he had under gone or the fatigues of the day or his glimpse of the invisible world or the dull conversation of the ghost or the lateness of the hour much in need of repose went straight to bed without undressing and fell asleep upon the instant st ave two the first of the three spirits when scrooge awoke it was so dark that looking out of bed he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber he was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes when the the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https neighbouring church struck the four quarters so he listened the hour to his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven and from seven to eight and regularly up to twelve then stopped twelve it was past two when he went to bed the clock was wrong an icicle must have got into the works twelve he touched the spring of his repeater to correct this most preposterous clock its rapid little pulse beat twelve and stopped why it isn t possible said scrooge that i can have slept through whole day and far into another night it isn t possible that anything has happened to the sun and this is twelve at noon the idea being an alarming one he scrambled out of bed and groped his way to the window he was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his before he could see anything and could see very little then all he could make out was that it was still very foggy and extremely cold and that there was noise of people running to and fro and making great stir there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day and taken possession of the world this was great relief because three days after sight of this first of exchange pay to ebenezer scrooge or his order and so forth would have become mere united states security if there were days to count by scrooge went to bed again and thought and thought and thought it over and over and over and could make nothing of it the more he thought the more perplexed he was and the more he endeavoured not to think the more he thought marley s ghost bothered him exceedingly every time he resolved within himself after mature inquiry that it was all dream his mind ﬂew back again like strong spring released to its ﬁrst position and presented the same problem to be worked all through w it dream or not scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more when he remembered on sudden that the ghost had warned him of visitation when the bell tolled one he resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed and considering that he could more go to sleep than go to heaven this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power the quarter was so long that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into doze unconsciously and missed the clock at length it broke upon his listening ear ding dong quarter past said scrooge counting ding dong said scrooge ding dong quarter to it said scrooge ding dong the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https the hour itself said scrooge triumphantly and nothing else he spoke before the hour bell sounded which it now did with deep dull hollow melancholy one light ﬂashed up in the room upon the instant and the curtains of his bed were drawn the curtains of his bed were drawn aside i tell you by hand not the curtains at his feet nor the curtains at his back but those to which his face was addressed the curtains of his bed were drawn aside and scrooge starting up into attitude found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them close to it i am now to you and i am standing in the spirit at your elbow it was strange child yet not so like child like an old man viewed throug h some supernatural medium which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view and being diminished to child s proportions its hair which hung about its neck and down its back was white if with age and yet the face had not wrinkle in it and the tenderest bloom was on the skin the arms were very long and muscular the hands the same if its hold were of uncommon strength its legs and feet most delicately formed were like those upper members bare it wore tunic of the purest white and round its waist was bound lustrous belt the sheen of which was beautiful it held branch of fresh green holly in its hand and in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem had its dress trimmed with summer ﬂowers but the strangest thing about it was that from the crown of its head there sprung bright clear jet of light by which all this was visible and which was doubtless the occasion of its using in its duller moments great extinguisher cap which it now held under its arm even this though when scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness was not its strangest quality its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another and what was light one instant at another time was dark so the ﬁgure itself ﬂuctuated in its distinctness being now thing with one arm now with one leg now with twenty legs now pair of legs without head now head without body of which dissolving parts outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away and in the very wonder of this it would be itself again distinct and clear ever are you the spirit sir whose coming was foretold to asked scrooge i am the voice was soft and gentle singularly low if instead of being so close beside him it were at distance who and what are you scrooge demanded i am the ghost of christmas long past inquired scrooge observant of its dwarﬁsh stature your the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https scrooge could not have told anybody why if anybody could have asked him but he had special desire to see the spirit in his cap and begged him to be covered what exclaimed the ghost would you so soon put out with worldly hands the light i give is it not enough that you are one of those whose passion s made this cap and force through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully bonneted the spirit at any period of his life he then made bold to inquire what business brought him there your welfare said the ghost scrooge expressed himself much obliged but could not help thinking that night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end the spirit must have heard him thinking it said immediately your reclamation then take heed it put out its strong hand it spoke and clasped him gently by the arm rise and walk with it would have been in vain scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes that bed was warm and the thermometer long way below freezing that he was clad but lightly in his slippers and nightcap and that he had cold upon him at that time the grasp though gentle woman s hand was not to be resisted he rose but ﬁnding that the spirit made towards the window clasped his robe in supplication i am mortal scrooge remonstrated and liable to bear but touch of my hand there said the spirit laying it upon his heart and you shall be upheld in more than this the words were spoken they passed through the wall and stood upon an open country road with ﬁelds on either hand the city had entirely vanished not vestige of it was to be seen the darkness and the mist had vanished with it it was clear cold winter day with snow upon the ground good heaven said scrooge clasping his hands together he looked about him i was bred in this place i was boy here the spirit gazed upon him mildly its gentle touch though it had been light and instantaneous appeared still present to the old man s sense of feeling he was conscious of thousand odours ﬂoating in the air each one connected with thousand thoughts and hopes and joys and cares long long gotten your lip is trembling said the ghost and what is that upon your cheek scrooge muttered with an unusual catching in his voice that it was pimple and begged the ghost to lead the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https he would you recollect the way inquired the spirit remember it cried scrooge with fervour i could walk it strange to have forgotten it so many years observed the ghost let us go they walked along the road scrooge recognising every gate and post and tree until little appeared in the distance with its bridge its church and winding river some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs who called to other boys in country gigs and carts driven by farmers all these boys were in great spirits and shouted to each other until the broad ﬁelds were so full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it these are but shadows of the things that have been said the ghost they have consciousness of the jocund travellers came on and they came scrooge knew and named them every one why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them why did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up they went past why was he ﬁlled with gladness when he heard them give each other merry christmas they parted at and ways their several homes what was merry christmas to scrooge out upon merry christmas what good had it ever done to him the school is not quite deserted said the ghost solitary child neglected by his friends is left there scrooge said he knew it and he sobbed they left the by lane and soon approached mansion of dull red brick with little cupola on the roof and bell hanging in it it was large house but one of broken fortunes the spacious ofﬁces were little used their walls were damp and mossy their windows broken and their gates decayed fowls clucked and strutted in the stables and the and sheds were with grass nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within entering the dreary hall and glancing through the open doors of many rooms they found them poorly furnished cold and vast there was an earthy savour in the air chilly bareness in the place which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by and not too much to eat they went the ghost and scrooge across the hall to door at the back of the house it opened before them and disclosed long bare melancholy room made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks at one of these lonely boy was reading near feeble ﬁre and scrooge sat down upon form and wept to see his poor forgotten self he used to be not latent echo in the house not squeak and scufﬂe from the mice behind the panelling not drip from the thawed water in the dull yard behind not sigh among the leaﬂess boughs of one despondent poplar not the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https swinging of an empty door not clicking in the ﬁre but fell upon the heart of scrooge with softening inﬂuence and gave freer passage to his tears the spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self intent upon his reading suddenly man in foreign garments wonderfully real and distinct to look at stood outside the window with an axe stuck in his belt and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood why it s ali baba scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy it s dear old honest ali baba yes yes i know one christmas time when yonder solitary child was left here all alone he did come the ﬁrst time just like that poor boy and valentine said scrooge and his wild brother orson there they go and what s his name who was put down in his drawers asleep at the gate of damascus don t you see him and the sultan s groom turned upside down by the genii there he is upon his head serve him right i m glad of it what business had he to be married to the princess to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects in most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying and to see his heightened and excited face would have been surprise to his business friends in the city indeed there s the parrot cried scrooge green body and yellow tail with thing like lettuce growing out of the top of his head there he is poor robin crusoe he called him when he came home again after sailing round the island poor robin crusoe where have you been robin crusoe the man thought he was dreaming but he wasn it was the parrot you know there goes friday running his life to the little creek halloa hoop halloo then with rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character he said in pity his former self poor boy and cried again i wish scrooge muttered putting his hand in his pocket and looking about him after drying his eyes with his cuf f but it s too late now what is the matter asked the spirit nothing said scrooge nothing there was boy singing christmas carol at my door last night i should like to have given him something that s the ghost smiled thoughtfully and waved its hand saying it did so let us see another christmas scrooge s former self grew larger at the words and the room became little darker and more dirty the panels shrunk the windows cracked fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling and the naked laths were shown instead but how all this was brought about scrooge knew more than you he only knew that it was quite correct that everything had happened so that there he was alone again when all the other boys had gone home the jolly holidays he was not reading now but walking up and down despairingly scrooge looked at the ghost and with the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https shaking of his head glanced anxiously towards the door it opened and little girl much younger than the boy came darting in and putting her arms about his neck and often kissing him addressed him her dear dear brother i have come to bring you home dear brother said the child clapping her tiny hands and bending down to laugh to bring you home home home home little fan returned the boy yes said the child brimful of glee home good and all home ever and ever father is so much kinder than he used to be that home s like heaven he spoke so gently to one dear night when i was going to bed that i was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home and he said yes you should and sent in coach to bring you and you re to be man said the child opening her eyes and are never to come back here but ﬁrst we re to be together all the christmas long and have the merriest time in all the you are quite woman little fan exclaimed the boy she clapped her hands and laughed and tried to touch his head but being too little laughed again and stood on tiptoe to embrace him then she began to drag him in her childish eagerness towards the door and he nothing loth to go accompanied her terrible voice in the hall cried bring down master scrooge s box there and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself who glared on master scrooge with ferocious condescension and threw him into dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him he then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of shivering parlour that ever was seen where the maps upon the wall and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows were waxy with cold here he produced decanter of curiously light wine and block of curiously heavy cake and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people at the same time sending out meagre servant to offer glass of something to the postboy who answered that he thanked the gentleman but if it was the same tap he had tasted before he had rather not master scrooge s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise the children bade the schoolmaster right willingly and getting into it drove gaily down the the quick wheels dashing the and snow from off the dark leaves of the ever greens like spray always delicate creature whom breath might have withered said the ghost but she had lar ge heart so she had cried scrooge you re right i will not gainsay it spirit god forbid she died woman said the ghost and had i think one child scrooge returned true said the ghost y our nephew the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https

where shadowy carts and coaches battled the way and all the strife and tumult of real city were it was made plain enough by the dressing of the shops that here too it was christmas time again but it was evening and the streets were lighted up the ghost stopped at certain warehouse door and asked scrooge if he knew it know it said scrooge w i apprenticed here they went in at sight of an old gentleman in welsh wig sitting behind such high desk that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling scrooge cried in great excitement why it s old fezziwig bless his heart it s fezziwig alive again old fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock which pointed to the hour of seven he rubbed his hands adjusted his capacious waistcoat laughed all over himself from his shoes to his organ of benevolence and called out in comfortable oily rich fat jovial voice yo ho there ebenezer dick scrooge s former self now grown young man came briskly in accompanied by his prentice dick wilkins to be sure said scrooge to the ghost bless yes there he is he was very much attached to was dick poor dick dear dear yo ho my boys said fezziwig more work

from over the way who was suspected of not having board enough from his master trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress in they all came one after another some shyly some boldly some gracefully some awkwardly some pushing some pulling in they all came anyhow and everyhow away they all went twenty couple at once hands half round and back again the other way down the middle and up again round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping old top couple always turning up in the wrong place new top couple starting off again soon they got there all top couples at last and not bottom one to help them when this result was brought about old fezziwig clapping his hands to stop the dance cried out well done and the ﬁddler plunged his hot face into pot of porter especially provided that purpose but scorning rest upon his reappearance he instantly began again though there were dancers yet if the other ﬁddler had been carried home exhausted on shutter and he were man resolved to beat him out of sight or perish there were more dances and there were forfeits and more dances and there was cake and there was negus and there was great piece of cold roast and there was great piece of cold boiled and there were and plenty of beer but the great effect of the evening came after the roast and boiled when the ﬁddler an artful dog mind the sort of man who knew his business better than you or i could have told it him struck up sir roger coverley then old fezziwig stood out to dance with fezziwig top

corkscrew and back again to your place fezziwig cut so deftly that he appeared to wink with his legs and came upon his feet again without stagger when the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up and fezziwig took their stations one on either side of the door and shaking hands with every person individually he or she went out wished him or her merry christmas when everybody had retired but the two prentices they did the same to them and thus the cheerful voices died away and the lads were left to their beds which were under counter in the during the whole of this time scrooge had acted like man out of his wits his heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self he corroborated everything remembered everything enjoyed everything and underwent the strangest agitation it was not until now when the the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https of his former self and dick were turned from them that he remembered the ghost and became conscious that it was looking full upon him while the light upon its head burnt very clear small matter said the ghost to make these silly folks so full of small echoed scrooge the spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices who were pouring out their hearts in praise of fezziwig and when he had done so said why is it not he has spent but few pounds of your mortal money three or four perhaps is that so much that he deserves this praise it isn t that said scrooge heated by the remark and speaking unconsciously like his former not his latter self it isn t that spirit he has the power to render us happy or unhappy to make our service light or burdensome pleasure or toil say that his power lies in words and looks in things so slight and insigniﬁcant that it is impossible to add and count up what then the happiness he gives is quite great if it cost he felt the spirit s glance and stopped what is the matter asked the ghost nothing particular said scrooge something i think the ghost insisted said scrooge i should like to be able to say word or two to my clerk just now that s his former self turned down the lamps he gave utterance to the wish and scrooge and the ghost again stood side by side in the open air my time grows short observed the spirit quick this was not addressed to scrooge or to any one whom he could see but it produced an immediate effect again scrooge saw himself he was older now man in the prime of life his face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice there was an eager greedy restless motion in the eye which showed the passion that had taken root and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall he was not alone but sat by the side of fair young girl in in whose eyes there were tears which sparkled in the light that shone out of the ghost of christmas past it matters little she said softly to you very little another idol has displaced and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come i would have tried to i have just cause to what idol has displaced you he rejoined golden this is the dealing of the world he said there is nothing on which it is so hard poverty and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity the pursuit of wealth the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https you fear the world too much she answered gently all your other

conduct home why you delight to torture the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https one shadow more exclaimed the ghost more cried scrooge more i don t wish to see it show more but the relentless ghost pinioned him in both his arms and forced him to observe what happened next they were in another scene and place room not very large or handsome but full of comfort near to the winter ﬁre sat beautiful young girl so like that last that scrooge believed it was the same until he saw her now comely matron sitting opposite her daughter the noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous there were more children there than scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count and unlike the celebrated herd in the poem they were not forty children conducting themselves like one but every child was conducting itself like forty the consequences were uproarious beyond belief but one seemed to care on the contrary the mother and daughter laughed heartily and enjoyed it very much and the latter soon beginning to mingle in the sports got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly what would i not have given to be one of them though i never could have been so rude i wouldn t the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair and torn it down and the precious little shoe i wouldn t have plucked it off god bless my soul to save my life to measuring her waist in

touched her lips to have questioned her that she might have opened them to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes and never raised blush to have let loose waves of hair an inch of which would be keepsake beyond price in short i should have liked i confess to have had the lightest licence of child and yet to have been man enough to know its value but now knocking at the door was heard and such rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of ﬂushed and boisterous group just in time to greet the father who came home attended by man laden with christmas toys and presents then the shouting and the struggling and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter the scaling him with chairs ladders to dive into his pockets despoil him of parcels hold on tight by his cravat hug him round his neck pommel his back and kick his legs in irrepressible affection the shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received the terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting doll s into his mouth and was more than suspected of having swallowed ﬁctitious turkey glued on wooden platter the immense relief of ﬁnding this false alarm the joy and gratitude and ecstasy they are all indescribable alike it is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour and by one stair at time up to the top of the house where they went to bed and so the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https now scrooge looked on more attentively than ever when the master of the house having his daughter leaning fondly on him sat down with her and her mother at his own ﬁreside and when he thought that such another

he had candle inside i could scarcely help seeing him his partner lies upon the point of death i hear and there he sat alone quite alone in the world i spirit said scrooge in broken voice remove from this i told you these were shadows of the things that have been said the ghost that they are what they are not blame remove scrooge exclaimed i can not bear it he turned upon the ghost and seeing that it looked upon him with face in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him wrestled with it leave take back haunt longer in the struggle if that can be called struggle in which the ghost with visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright and dimly connecting that with its inﬂuence over him he seized the extinguisher and by sudden action pressed it down upon its head the spirit dropped beneath it so that the extinguisher covered its whole form but though scrooge pressed it down with all his force he could not hide the light which streamed from under it in an unbroken ﬂood upon the ground he was conscious of being exhausted and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness and further of being in his own bedroom he gave the cap parting squeeze in which his hand relaxed and had barely time to reel to bed before he sank into heavy the project

together scrooge had occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of one he felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time the especial purpose of holding conference with the second messenger despatched to him through jacob marley s intervention but ﬁnding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back he put them every one aside with his own hands and lying down again established sharp all round the bed he wished to challenge the spirit on the moment of its appearance and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous gentlemen of the sort who plume themselves on being acquainted with move or two and being usually equal to the express the wide range of their capacity

appeared he was taken with violent ﬁt of trembling five minutes ten minutes quarter of an hour went by yet nothing came all this time he lay upon his bed the very core and centre of blaze of ruddy light which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour and which being only light was more alarming than dozen ghosts he was powerless to make out what it meant or would be at and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion without having the consolation of knowing it at last however he began to you or i would have thought at ﬁrst it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it and would unquestionably have done it last i say he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room from whence on further tracing it it seemed to shine this idea taking full possession of his mind he got up softly and shufﬂed in his slippers to the door the moment scrooge s hand was on the lock strange voice called him by his name and bade him enter he obeyed it was his own room there was doubt about that but it had under gone surprising transformation the walls and ceiling were so hung with living green that it looked perfect grove from every part of which bright gleaming berries glistened the crisp leaves of holly

looked black enough and the windows blacker contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs and with the dirtier snow upon the ground which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons furrows that crossed and each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off and made intricate channels hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water the sky was gloomy and the shortest streets were choked up with dingy mist half thawed half frozen whose heavier particles descended in shower of sooty atoms if all the chimneys in great britain had by one consent caught ﬁre and were blazing away to their dear hearts content there was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town and yet was there an air of

the grocers nearly closed with perhaps two shutters down or one but through those gaps such glimpses it was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made merry sound or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare the almonds so extremely white the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight the other spices so delicious the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar to make the coldest feel faint and subsequently bilious nor was it that the ﬁgs were moist and pulpy or that the french plums blushed in modest tartness from their decorated boxes or that everything was good to eat and in its christmas dress but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day that they tumbled up against each other at the door crashing their wicker baskets wildly and left their purchases upon the counter and came running back to fetch them and committed hundreds of the like mistakes in the best humour possible while the grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own worn outside general inspection and christmas daws to peck at if they chose but soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel and away they came ﬂocking through the streets in their best clothes and with their gayest faces and at the same time there emer ged from scores of lanes and nameless turnings innumerable people carrying their dinners to the bakers shops the sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the spirit very much he stood with scrooge beside him in baker s doorway and taking off the covers their bearers passed sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch and it was very uncommon kind of torch once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner who had jostled each other he shed few drops of water on them from it and their good humour was restored directly they the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https was shame to quarrel upon christ day and so it was god love it so it was in time the bells ceased and the bakers were shut up and yet there was genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker s oven where the pavement smoked if its stones were cooking too is there peculiar ﬂavour in what you sprinkle from your torch asked scrooge there is my would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day asked scrooge to any kindly given to poor one why to poor one most asked scrooge because it needs it spirit said scrooge after moment s thought i wonder you of all the beings in the many worlds about us should desire to cramp these people s opportunities of innocent i cried the spirit you would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all said scrooge w ouldn t you i cried the spirit you seek to close these places on the seventh day said scrooge and it comes to the same i seek exclaimed the spirit forgive if i am wrong it has been done in your name or at least in that of your family said scrooge there are some upon this earth of yours returned the spirit who lay claim to know us and who their deeds of passion pride hatred envy bigotry and selﬁshness in our name who are stran ge to us and all our kith and kin if they had never lived remember that and charge their doings on themselves not scrooge promised that he would and they went on invisible they had been before into the suburbs of the town it was remarkable quality of the ghost which scrooge had observed at the baker s that notwithstanding his gigantic size he could accommodate himself to any place with ease and that he stood beneath low roof quite gracefully and like supernatural creature it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall and perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in showing off this power of his or else it was his own kind generous hearty nature and his sympathy with all poor men that led him straight to scrooge s clerk s there he went and took scrooge with him holding to his robe and on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled and stopped to bless bob cratchit s dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch think of that bob had but ﬁfteen bob himself he pocketed on saturdays but ﬁfteen copies of his christian name and yet the ghost of christmas present blessed his four house the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https up rose cratchit cratchit s wife dressed out but poorly in gown but brave in ribbons which are cheap and make goodly show sixpence and she laid the cloth assisted by belinda cratchit second of her daughters also brave in ribbons while master peter cratchit plunged fork into the saucepan of potatoes and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar bob s private property conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day into his mouth rejoiced to ﬁnd himself so gallantly attired and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable parks and now two smaller cratchits boy and girl came tearing in screaming that outside the baker s they had smelt the goose and known it their own and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion these young cratchits danced about the table and exalted master peter cratchit to the skies while he not

home rampant not coming upon christmas day martha didn t like to see him disappointed if it were only in joke so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door and ran into his arms while the two young cratchits hustled tiny tim and bore him off into the that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https and how did little tim behave asked cratchit when she had rallied bob on his credulity and bob had hugged his daughter to his heart s content good gold said bob and better somehow he gets thoughtful sitting by himself so much and thinks the strangest things you ever heard he told coming home that he hoped the people saw him in the church because he was cripple and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon christmas day who made lame beggars walk and blind men bob s voice was tremulous when he told them this and trembled more when he said that tiny tim was growing strong and hearty his active little crutch was heard upon the ﬂoor and back came tiny tim before another word was spoken escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the ﬁre and while bob turning up his if poor fellow they were capable of being made more some hot mixture in jug with gin and lemons and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer master peter and the two ubiquitous young cratchits went to fetch the goose with which they soon returned in high procession such bustle ensued that you might have thought goose the rarest of all birds feathered phen omenon to which black swan was matter of in truth it was something very like it in that house cratchit made the gravy ready beforehand in little saucepan hissing hot master peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour miss belinda sweetened up the uce martha dusted the hot plates bob took tiny tim beside him in tiny corner at the table the two young cratchits set chairs everybody not forgetting themselves and mounting guard upon their posts crammed spoons into their mouths lest they should shriek goose before their turn came to be helped at last the dishes were set on and grace was said it was succeeded by breathless pause cratchit looking slowly all along the prepared to plunge it in the breast but when she did and when the long expected gush of stufﬁng issued forth one murmur of delight arose all round the board and even tiny tim excited by the two young cratchits beat on the table with the handle of his knife and feebly cried hurrah there never was such goose bob said he didn t believe there ever was such goose cooked its tenderness and ﬂavour size and cheapness were the themes of universal admiration eked out by and mashed potatoes it was sufﬁcient dinner the whole family indeed cratchit said with great delight surveying one small atom of bone upon the dish they hadn t ate it all at last yet every one had had enough and the youngest cratchits in particular were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows but now the plates being changed by miss belinda cratchit left the room nervous to bear witnesses take the pudding up and bring it the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles

which the two young cratchits became livid all sorts of horrors were supposed hallo great deal of steam the puddi ng was out of the copper smell like that was the cloth smell like an and pastrycook s next door to each other with laundress s next door to that that was the pudding in half minute cratchit ﬂushed but smiling the pudding like speckled so hard and ﬁrm blazing in half of of ignited brandy and bedight with christmas holly stuck into the top oh wonderful pudding bob cratchit said and calmly too that he regarded it the greatest success achieved by cratchit since their marriage cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of ﬂour everybody had something to say about it but nobody said or thought it was at all small pudding large family it would have been ﬂat heresy to so any cratchit would have blushed to hint at such thing at last the dinner was all done the cloth was cleared the hearth swept and the ﬁre made up the compound in the jug being tasted and considered perfect apples and oranges were put upon the table and full of chestnuts on the ﬁre then all the cratchit family drew round the hearth in what bob cratchit called circle meaning half one and at bob cratchit s elbow stood the family display of glass two tumblers and without handle these held the hot stuff from the jug however well golden goblets would have done and bob served it out with beaming looks while the chestnuts on the ﬁre sputtered and cracked noisily then bob proposed merry christmas to us all my dears god bless us which all the family god bless us every one said tiny tim the last of all he sat very close to his father s side upon his little stool bob held his withered little hand in his if he loved the child and wished to keep him by his side and dreaded that he might be taken from him spirit said scrooge with an interest he had never felt before tell if tiny tim will i see vacant seat replied the ghost in the poor and crutch without an owner carefully preserved if these shadows remain unaltered by the future the child will said scrooge oh kind spirit say he will be if these shadows remain unaltered by the future none other of my race returned the ghost will ﬁnd him here what then if he be like to die he had better it and decrease the surplus the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the spirit and was overcome with penitence and grief man said the ghost if man you be in heart not adamant forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is and where it is will you decide what men shall live what men shall die it may be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less ﬁt to live than millions like this poor man s child oh god to hear the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust scrooge bent before the ghost s rebuke and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground but he raised them speedily on hearing his own name mr scrooge said bob i ll give you scrooge the founder of the feast the founder of the feast indeed cried cratchit reddening i wish i had him here i d give him piece of my mind to feast upon and i hope he d have good appetite my dear said bob the children christmas day it should be christmas day i am sure said she on which one drinks the health of such an odious stingy hard unfeeling man scrooge you know he is robert nobody knows it better than you poor fellow my dear was bob s mild answer christmas day i ll drink his health your sake and the day s said cratchit not his long life to him merry christmas and happy new year he ll be very merry and very happy i have doubt the children drank the toast after her it was the ﬁrst of their proceedings which had heartiness tiny tim drank it last of all but he didn t care twopence it scrooge was the ogre of the family the mention of his name cast dark shadow on the party which was not dispelled full ﬁve minutes after it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before from the mere relief of scrooge the baleful being done with bob cratchit told them how he had situation in his eye master peter which would bring in if obtained full weekly the two young cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of peter s being man of business and peter himself looked thoughtfully at the ﬁre from between his collars if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income martha who was poor apprentice at milliner s then told them what kind of work she had to and how many hours she worked at stretch and how she meant to lie abed morrow morning good long rest being holiday she passed at home also how she had seen countess and lord some days before and how the lord was much about tall peter at which peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn t have seen his head if you had been there all this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round and they had song about lost child travelling in the snow from tiny the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https had plaintive little voice and sang it very well indeed there was nothing of high mark in this they were not handsome family they were not well dressed their shoes were far from being water their clothes were scanty and peter might have known and very likely did the inside of pawnbroker s but they were happy grateful pleased with one another and contented with the time and when they faded and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the spirit s torch at parting scrooge had his eye upon them and especially on tiny tim until the last by this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty heavily and scrooge and the spirit went along the streets the brightness of the roaring ﬁres in kitchens parlours and all sorts of rooms was wonderful here the ﬂickering of the blaze showed preparations cosy dinner with hot plates baking through and through before the ﬁre and deep red curtains ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness there all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters brothers cousins uncles aunts and be the ﬁrst to greet them here again were shadows on the of guests assembling and there group of handsome girls all hooded and and all chattering at once tripped lightly off to some near neighbour s house where woe upon the single man who saw them witches well they knew glow but if you had judged from the numb ers of people on their way to friendly gatherings you might have thought that one was at home to give them welcome when they got there instead of every house expecting company and piling up its ﬁres high blessings on it how the ghost exulted how it bared its breadth of breast and opened its capacious palm and ﬂoated on outpouring with generous hand its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach the very lamplighter who ran on before dotting the dusky street with specks of light and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere laughed out loudly the spirit passed though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but christmas and now without word of warning from the ghost they stood upon bleak and desert moor where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about though it were the of giants and water spread itself wheresoever it listed or would have done so but the frost that held it prisoner and nothing grew but moss and furze and coarse rank grass down in the west the setting sun had left streak of ﬁery red which glared upon the desolation an instant like sullen eye and frowning lower lower lower yet was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night what place is this asked scrooge place where miners live who labour in the bowels of the earth returned the spirit but they know see light shone from the window of hut and swiftly they advanced towards it passing through the wall of mud and stone they found cheerful company assembled round the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https ﬁre an old old man and woman with their children and their children s children and another generation beyond that all decked out gaily in their holiday attire the old man in voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste was singing them christmas had been very old song when he was from time to time they all joined in the chorus so surely they raised their voices the old man got quite blithe and loud and so surely they stopped his vigour sank again the spirit did not tarry here but bade scrooge hold his robe and passing on above the moor not to sea to sea to scrooge s horror looking back he saw the last of the land frightful range of rocks behind them and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water it rolled and roared and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn and ﬁercely tried to undermine the earth built upon dismal reef of sunken rocks some league or so from shore on which the waters chafed and dashed the wild year through there stood solitary lighthouse great heaps of clung to its base and of the wind one might suppose of the rose and fell about it like the waves they skimmed but even here two men who watched the light had made ﬁre that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out ray of brightness on the awful sea joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat they wished each other merry christmas in their can of grog and one of them the elder too with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather the of an old ship might be struck up sturdy song that was like gale in itself again the ghost sped on above the black and heaving being far away he told scrooge from any shore they lighted on ship they stood beside the helmsman at the wheel the in the bow the ofﬁcers who had the watch dark ghostly ﬁgures in their several stations but every man among them hummed christmas tune or had christmas thought or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone christmas day with homeward hopes belonging to it and every man on board waking or sleeping good or bad had had kinder word another on that day than on any day in the year and had shared to some extent in its festivities and had remembered those he cared at distance and had known that they delighted to remember him it was great surprise to scrooge while listening to the moaning of the wind and thinking what solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss whose depths were secrets profound death it was great surprise to scrooge while thus engaged to hear hearty laugh it was much greater surprise to scrooge to recognise it his own nephew s and to ﬁnd himself in bright dry gleaming room with the spirit standing smiling by his side and looking at that same nephew with approving af fability ha ha laughed scrooge s nephew ha ha ha the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https you should happen by any unlikely chance to know man more blest in laugh than scrooge s nephew all i can say is i should like to know him too introduce him to and i ll cultivate his acquaintance it is fair noble adjustment of things that while there is infection in disease and sorrow there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious laughter and when scrooge s nephew laughed in this way holding his sides rolling his head and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions scrooge s niece by marriage laughed heartily he and their assembled friends being not bit behindhand roared out lustily ha ha ha ha ha ha he said that christmas was humbug i live cried scrooge s nephew he believed it too more shame him fred said scrooge s niece indignantly bless those women they never anything by halves they are always in earnest she was very pretty exceedingly pretty with dimpled capital face ripe little mouth that seemed made to be doubt it was all kinds of good little dots about her chin that melted into one another when she laughed and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature s head altogether she was what you would have called provoking you know but satisfactory too oh perfectly satisfactory he s comical old fellow said scrooge s nephew that s the truth and not so pleasant he might be however his offences carry their own punishment and i have nothing to say against i m sure he is very rich fred hinted scrooge s niece at least you always tell what of that my dear said scrooge s nephew his wealth is of use to him he don t any good with it he don t make himself comfortable with it he hasn t the satisfaction of ha ha he is ever going to beneﬁt us with i have patience with him observed scrooge s niece scrooge s niece s sisters and all the other ladies expressed the same opinion oh i have said scrooge s nephew i am sorry him i couldn t be angry with him if i tried who suffers by his ill whims himself always here he takes it into his head to dislike us and he won t come and dine with us what s the consequence he don t lose much of dinner indeed i think he loses very good dinner interrupted scrooge s niece everybody else said the same and they must be allowed to have been competent judges because they had just had dinner and with the dessert upon the table were clustered round the ﬁre by lamplight well i m very glad to hear it said scrooge s nephew because i haven t great faith in these young housekeepers what you say topper topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooge s niece s sisters he answered that bachelor was the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https outcast who had right to express an opinion on the subject whereat scrooge s niece s plump one with the lace tucker not the one with the blushed go on fred said scrooge s niece clapping her hands he never ﬁnishes what he begins to say he is such ridiculous fellow scrooge s nephew revelled in another laugh and it was impossible to keep the infection off though the plump sister tried hard to it with aromatic vinegar his example was unanimously followed i was only going to say said scrooge s nephew that the consequence of his taking dislike to us and not making merry with us is i think that he loses some pleasant moments which could him harm i am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can ﬁnd in his own thoughts either in his mouldy old ofﬁce or his dusty chambers i mean to give him the same chance every year whether he likes it or not i pity him he may rail at christmas till he dies but he can t help thinking better of it defy he ﬁnds going there in good temper year after year and saying uncle scrooge how are you if it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk ﬁfty pounds that s something and i think i shook him yesterday it was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking scrooge but being thoroughly and not much caring what they laughed at so that they laughed at any rate he encouraged them in their merriment and passed the bottle joyously after tea they had some music they were musical family and knew what they were about when they sung glee or catch i can assure you especially topper who could growl away in the bass like good one and never swell the large veins in his forehead or get red in the face over it scrooge s niece played well upon the harp and played among other tunes simple little air mere nothing you might learn to whistle it in two minutes which had been familiar to the child who fetched scrooge from the he had been reminded by the ghost of christmas past when this strain of music sounded all the things that ghost had shown him came upon his mind he softened more and more and thought that if he could have listened to it often years ago he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life his own happiness with his own hands without resorting to the sexton s spade that buried jacob marley but they didn t devote the whole evening to music after while they played at forfeits it is good to be children sometimes and never better than at christmas when its mighty founder was child himself stop there was ﬁrst game at s buff of course there was and i more believe topper was really blind than i believe he had eyes in his boots my opinion is that it was done thing between him and scrooge s nephew and that the ghost of christmas present knew it the way he went after the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the credulity of human nature knocking down the tumbling over the chairs bumping against the piano smothering himself among the curtains wherever she went there went he he always knew where the plump sister was he wouldn t catch anybody else if you had fallen up against him some of them did on purpose he would have made feint of endeavouring to seize you which would have been an affront to your understanding and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister she often cried out that it wasn t fair and it really was not but when at last he caught her when in spite of all her silken rustlings and her rapid ﬂutterings past him he got her into corner whence there was escape then his conduct was the most execrable his pretending not to know her his pretending that it was necessary to touch her and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing certain ring upon her ﬁnger and certain chain about her neck was vile monstrous doubt she told him her opinion of it when another being in ofﬁce they were so very conﬁdential together behind the curtains scrooge s niece was not one of the s buff party but was made comfortable with large chair and footstool in snug corner where the ghost and scrooge were close behind her but she joined in the forfeits and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet likewise at the game of how when and where she was very great and to the secret joy of scrooge s nephew beat her sisters hollow though they were sharp girls too topper could have told you there might have been twenty people there young and old but they all played and so did scrooge wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on that his voice made sound in their ears he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud and very often guessed quite right too the sharpest needle best whitechapel warranted not to cut in the eye was not sharper than scrooge blunt he took it in his head to be the ghost was greatly pleased to ﬁnd him in this mood and looked upon him with such favour that he begged like boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed but this the spirit said could not be done here is new game said scrooge one half hour spirit only one it was game called yes and where scrooge s nephew had to think of something and the rest must ﬁnd out what he only answering to their questions yes or the case was the brisk ﬁre of question ing to which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal live animal rather disagreeable animal savage animal an animal that growled and grunted sometimes and talked sometimes and lived in london and walked about the streets and wasn t made show of and wasn t led by anybody and didn t live in menagerie and was never killed in market and was not horse or an ass or cow or bull or tiger or dog or pig or cat or bear at every fresh question that was put to him this nephew the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https fresh roar of laughter and was so inexpressibly tickled that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp at last the plump sister falling into similar state cried out i have found it out i know what it is fred i know what it is what is it cried fred it s your uncle which it certainly was admiration was the universal sentiment though some objected that the reply to is it bear ought to have been yes inasmuch an answer in the negative was sufﬁcient to have diverted their thoughts from scrooge supposing they had ever had any tendency that way he has given us plenty of merriment i am sure said fred and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health here is glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment and i say uncle scrooge well uncle scrooge they cried merry christmas and happy new year to the old man whatever he is said scrooge s nephew he wouldn t take it from but may he have it nevertheless uncle scrooge uncle scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return and thanked them in an inaudible speech if the ghost had given him time but the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew and he and the spirit were again upon their travels much they saw and far they went and many homes they visited but always with happy end the spirit stood beside sick beds and they were cheerful on foreign lands and they were close at home by strugg ling men and they were patient in their greater hope by poverty and it was rich in almshouse hospital and jail in misery s every refuge where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door and barred the spirit out he left his blessing and taught scrooge his precepts it was long night if it were only night but scrooge had his doubts of this because the christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together it was strange too that while scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form the ghost grew older clearly older scrooge had observed this change but never spoke of it until they left children s twelfth night party when looking at the spirit they stood together in an open place he noticed that its hair was grey are spirits lives so short asked scrooge my life upon this globe is very brief replied the ghost it ends cried scrooge at midnight hark the time is drawing near the chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https forgive if i am not justiﬁed in what i ask said scrooge looking intently at the spirit s robe but i see something strange and not belonging to yourself protruding from your skirts is it foot or claw it might be claw the ﬂesh there is upon it was the spirit s sorrowful reply look from the foldings of its robe it brought two children wretched abject frightful hideous miserable they knelt down at its feet and clung upon the outside of its garment oh man look here look look down here exclaimed the ghost they were boy and girl yellow meagre ragged scowling wolﬁsh but prostrate too in their humility where graceful youth should have ﬁlled their features out and touched them with its freshest tints stale and shrivelled hand like that of age had pinched and twisted them and pulled them into shreds where angels might have sat enthroned devils lurked and glared out menacing change degradation perversion of humanity in any grade through all the mysteries of wonderful creation has monsters half so horrible and dread scrooge started back appalled having them shown to him in this way he tried to say they were ﬁne children but the words choked themselves rather than be parties to lie of such enormous magnitude spirit are they yours scrooge could say the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https they are man s said the spirit looking down upon them and they cling to appealing from their fathers this boy is ignorance this girl is want beware them both and all of their degree but most of all beware this boy on his brow i see that written which is doom unless the writing be erased deny it cried the spirit stretching out its hand towards the city slander those who tell it ye admit it your factious purposes and make it worse and bide the end have they refuge or resource cried scrooge are there prisons said the spirit turning on him the last time with his own words are there workhouses the bell struck twelve scrooge looked about him the ghost and saw it not the last stroke ceased to vibrate he remembered the prediction of old jacob marley and lifting up his eyes beheld solemn phantom draped and hooded coming like mist along the ground towards him st ave four the last of the spirits the phantom slowly gravely silently approached when it came near him scrooge bent down upon his knee in the very air through which this spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery it was shrouded in deep black garment which concealed its head its face its form and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand but this it would have been difﬁcult to detach its ﬁgure from the night and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded he felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him and that its mysterious presence ﬁlled him with solemn dread he knew more the spirit neither spoke nor moved i am in the presence of the ghost of christmas yet to come said scrooge the spirit answered not but pointed onward with its hand you are about to show shadows of the things that have not happened but will happen in the time before us scrooge pursued is that so spirit the upper portion of the garment was contracted an instant in its folds if the spirit had inclined its head that was the only answer he received although well used to ghostly company by this time scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it the spirit paused the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https observing his condition and giving him time to recover but scrooge was all the worse this it thrilled him with vague uncertain horror to know that behind the dusky shroud there were ghostly eyes intently ﬁxed upon him while he though he stretched his own to the utmost could see nothing but spectral hand and one great heap of black ghost of the future he exclaimed i fear you more than any spectre i have seen but i know your purpose is to good and i hope to live to be another man from what i was i am prepared to bear you company and it with thankful heart will you not speak to it gave him reply the hand was pointed straight before them lead on said scrooge lead on the night is waning fast and it is precious time to i know lead on spirit the phantom moved away it had come towards him scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress which bore him up he thought and carried him along they scarcely seemed to enter the city the city rather seemed to spring up about them and encompass them of its own act but there they were in the heart of it on change amongst the merchants who hurried up and down and chinked the money in their pockets and conversed in groups and looked at their watches and triﬂed thoughtfully with their great gold seals and so forth scrooge had seen them often the spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men observing that the hand was pointed to them scrooge advanced to listen to their talk said great fat man with monstrous chin i don t know much about it either way i only know he s when did he die inquired another last night i why what was the matter with him asked third taking vast quantity of snuff out of very large i thought he d never god knows said the ﬁrst with yawn what has he done with his money asked gentleman with pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose that shook like the gills of i haven t heard said the man with the large chin yawning again left it to his company perhaps he hasn t left it to that s all i know this pleasantry was received with general laugh it s likely to be very cheap funeral said the same speaker upon my life i don t know of anybody to go to it suppose we make up party and volunteer i don t mind going if lunch is provided observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose but i must be fed if i make another the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https well i am the most disinterested among you after all said the ﬁrst speaker i never wear black gloves and i never eat lunch but i ll offer to go if anybody else will when i come to think of it i m not at all sure that i wasn t his most particular friend we used to stop and speak whenever we met bye bye speakers and listeners strolled away and mixed with other groups scrooge knew the men and looked towards the spirit an explanation the phantom glided on into street its ﬁnger pointed to two persons meeting scrooge listened again thinking that the explanation might lie here he knew these men also perfectly they were men of business very wealthy and of great importance he had made point always of standing well in their esteem in business point of view that is strictly in business point of view how are you said one how are you returned the other well said the ﬁrst old scratch has got his own at last hey so i am told returned the second cold isn t it seasonable christmas time you re not skater i suppose something else to think of good morning not another word that was their meeting their conversation and their parting scrooge was at ﬁrst inclined to be surprised that the spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose he set himself to consider what it was likely to be they could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of jacob his old partner that was past and this ghost s province was the future nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them but nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral his own improvement he resolved to treasure up every word he heard and everything he saw and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed and would render the solution of these riddles easy he looked about in that very place his own image but another man stood in his accustomed corner and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day being there he saw likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the porch it gave him little surprise however he had been revolving in his mind change of life and thought and hoped he saw his resolutions carried out in this quiet and dark beside him stood the phantom with its outstretched hand when he roused himself from his thoughtful quest he fancied from the turn of the hand and its situation in reference to himself that the unseen the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https looking at him keenly it made him shudder and feel very cold they left the busy scene and went into an obscure part of the town where scrooge had never penetrated before although he recognised its situation and its bad repute the ways were foul and narrow the shops and houses wretched the people drunken slipshod ugly alleys and archways like so many cesspools disgor ged their offences of smell and dirt and life upon the straggling streets and the whole quarter reeked with crime with ﬁlth and misery far in this den of infamous resort there was browed beetling shop below roof where iron old rags bottles bones and greasy offal were bought upon the ﬂoor within were piled up heaps of rusty keys nails chains hinges ﬁles scales weights and refuse iron of all kinds secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags masses of corrupted fat and sepulchres of bones sitting in among the wares he dealt in by charcoal stove made of old bricks was rascal nearly sevent y years of age who had screened himself from the cold air without by frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon line and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement scrooge and the phantom came into the presence of this man just woman with heavy bundle slunk into the shop but she had scarcely entered when another woman similarly laden came in too and she was closely followed by man in faded black who was less startled by the sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other after short period of blank astonishment in which the old man with the pipe had joined them they all three burst into laugh let the charwoman alone to be the ﬁrst cried she who had entered ﬁrst let the laundress alone to be the second and let the undertaker s man alone to be the third look here old joe here s chance if we haven t all three met here without meaning it you couldn t have met in better place said old joe removing his pipe from his mouth come into the parlour you were made free of it long ago you know and the other two an t strangers stop till i shut the door of the shop ah how it skreeks there an t such rusty bit of metal in the place its own hinges i believe and i m sure there s such old bones here mine ha ha we re all suitable to our calling we re well matched come into the parlour come into the parlour the parlour was the space behind the screen of rags the old man raked the ﬁre together with an old and having trimmed his smoky lamp it was night with the stem of his pipe put it in his mouth again while he did this the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the ﬂoor and sat down in ﬂaunting manner on stool crossing her elbows on her knees and looking with bold deﬁance at the other two what odds then what odds dilber said the woman every person has right to take care the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https he always that s true indeed said the laundress man more why then don t stand staring if you was afraid woman who s the wiser we re not going to pick holes in each other s coats i suppose indeed said dilber and the man together we should hope very well then cried the woman that s enough who s the worse the loss of few things like these not dead man i indeed said dilber laughing if he wanted to keep after he was dead wicked old screw pursued the woman why wasn t he natural in his lifetime if he had been he d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with death instead of lying gasping out his last there alone by it s the truest word that ever was spoke said dilber it s judgment on i wish it was little heavier judgm ent replied the woman and it should have been you may depend upon it if i could have laid my hands on anything else open that bundle old joe and let know the value of it speak out plain i m not afraid to be the ﬁrst nor afraid them to see it we know pretty well that we were helping ourselves before we met here i believe it s sin open the bundle but the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this and the man in faded black mounting the breach ﬁrst produced his plunder it was not extensive seal or two pair of and brooch of great value were all they were severally examined and appraised by old joe who chalked the sums he was disposed to give each upon the wall and added them up into total when he found there was nothing more to come that s your account said joe and i wouldn t give another sixpence if i was to be boile d not doing it who s next dilber was next sheets and towels little wearing apparel two silver teaspoons pair of sugar tongs and few boots her account was stated on the wall in the same manner i always give too much to ladies it s weakness of mine and that s the way i ruin myself said old joe that s your account if you asked another penny and made it an open question i d repent of being so liberal and knock of f and now undo my bundle joe said the ﬁrst woman joe went down on his knees the greater convenience of opening it and having unfastened great many knots dragged out lar ge and heavy roll of some dark stuf what you call this said joe ah returned the woman laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https you don t mean to say you took down rings and all with him lying there said joe yes i replied the woman why not you were born to make your fortune said joe and you ll certainly i certainly shan t hold my hand when i can get anything in it by reaching it out the sake of such man he was i promise you joe returned the woman coolly don t drop that oil upon the blankets now his blankets asked joe whose else s you think replied the woman he isn t likely to take cold without i dare say i hope he didn t die of anything catching eh said old joe stopping in his work and looking up don t you be afraid of that returned the woman i an t so fond of his company that i d loiter about him such things if he did ah you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache but you won t ﬁnd hole in it nor threadbare place it s the best he had and ﬁne one too they d have wasted it if it hadn t been what you call wasting of it asked old joe putting it on him to be buried in to be sure replied the woman with laugh somebody was fool enough to it but i took it off again if calico an t good enough such purpose it isn t good enough anything it s quite becoming to the body he can t look uglier than he did in that scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror they sat grouped about their spoil in the scanty light afforded by the old man s lamp he viewed them with detestation and disgust which could hardly have been greater though they had been obscene demons marketing the corpse itself ha ha laughed the same woman when old joe producing ﬂannel bag with money in it told out their several gains upon the ground this is the end of it you see he frightened every one away from him when he was alive to proﬁt us when he was dead ha ha ha spirit said scrooge shuddering from head to foot i see i see the case of this unhappy man might be my own my life tends that way now merciful heaven what is this he recoiled in terror the scene had changed and now he almost touched bed bare uncurtained bed on which beneath ragged sheet there lay something covered up which though it was dumb announced itself in awful language the room was very dark too dark to be observed with any accuracy though scrooge glanced round it in obedience to secret impulse anxious to know what kind of room it was pale light rising in the outer air fell straight upon the bed and on it plundered and bereft unwatched unwept uncared was the body of this man scrooge glanced towards the phantom its steady hand was pointed to the head the cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it the motion of the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https scrooge s part would have disclosed the face he thought of it felt how easy it would be to and longed to it but had more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side oh cold cold rigid dreadful death set up thine altar here and dress it with such terrors thou hast at thy command this is thy dominion but of the loved revered and honoured head thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes or make one feature odious it is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released it is not that the heart and pulse are still but that the hand was open generous and true the heart brave warm and tender and the pulse man strike shadow strike and see his good deeds springing from the wound to sow the world with life immortal voice pronounced these words in scrooge s ears and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed he thought if this man could be raised up now what would be his foremost thoughts avarice griping cares they have brought him to rich end truly he lay in the dark empty house with not man woman or child to say that he was kind to in this or that and the memory of one kind word i will be kind to him cat was tearing at the door and there was sound of gnawing rats beneath the what they wanted in the room of death and why they were so restless and disturbed scrooge did not dare to think spirit he said this is fearful place in leaving it i shall not leave its lesson trust let us go still the ghost pointed with an unmoved ﬁnger to the head i understand you scrooge returned and i would it if i could but i have not the power spirit i have not the power again it seemed to look upon him if there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this man s death said scrooge quite agonised show that person to spirit i beseech you the phantom spread its dark robe before him moment like wing and withdrawing it revealed room by daylight where mother and her children were she was expecting some one and with anxious eagerness she walked up and down the room started at every sound looked out from the window glanced at the clock tried but in vain to work with her needle and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play at length the knock was heard she hurried to the door and met her husband man whose face was careworn and depressed though he was young there was remarkable expression in it now kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed and which he struggled to repress he sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding him by the ﬁre and when she asked him faintly what news which was not until after long silence he appeared embarrassed how to answer the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https is it good she said or bad help him bad he answered we are quite ruined there is hope yet if he relents she said amazed there is nothing is past hope if such miracle has he is past relenting said her husband he is she was mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth but she was thankful in her soul to hear it and she said so with clasped hands she prayed forgiveness the next moment and was sorry but the ﬁrst was the emotion of her heart what the woman whom i told you of last night said to when i tried to see him and obtain week s delay and what i thought was mere excuse to avoid turns out to have been quite true he was not only very ill but dying to whom will our debt be transferred i don t know but before that time we shall be ready with the money and even though we were not it would be bad fortune indeed to ﬁnd so merciless creditor in his successor we may sleep with light hearts caroline yes soften it they would their hearts were lighter the children s faces hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood were brighter and it was happier house this man s death the only emotion that the ghost could show him caused by the event was one of pleasure let see some tenderness connected with death said scrooge or that dark chamber spirit which we left just now will be ever present to the ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet and they went along scrooge looked here and there to ﬁnd himself but nowhere was he to be seen they entered poor bob cratchit s house the dwelling he had visited before and found the mother and the children seated round the ﬁre quiet very quiet the noisy little cratchits were still statues in one corner and sat lookin g up at peter who had book before him the mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing but surely they were very quiet and he took child and set him in the midst of where had scrooge heard those words he had not dreamed them the boy must have read them out he and the spirit crossed the threshold why did he not go on the mother laid her work upon the table and put her hand up to her face the colour hurts my eyes she said the colour ah poor tiny tim they re better now again said cratchit s wife it makes them weak by and i wouldn t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home the world it must be near his the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https past it rather peter answered shutting up his book but i think he has walked little slower than he used these few last evenings mother they were very quiet again at last she said and in steady cheerful voice that only faltered once i have known him walk have known him walk with tiny tim upon his shoulder very fast and so have i cried peter and so have i exclaimed another so had all but he was very light to carry she resumed intent upon her work and his father loved him so that it was trouble trouble and there is your father at the door she hurried out to meet him and little bob in his had need of it poor in his tea was ready him on the hob and they all tried who should help him to it most then the two young cratchits got upon his knees and laid each child little cheek against his face if they said don t mind it father don t be grieved bob was very cheerful with them and spoke pleasantly to all the family he looked at the work upon the table and praised the industry and speed of cratchit and the girls they would be done long before sunday he said sunday you went then robert said his wife yes my dear returned bob i wish you could have gone it would have done you good to see how green place it is but you ll see it often i promised him that i would walk there on sunday my little little child cried bob my little child he broke down all at once he could n t help it if he could have helped it he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were he left the room and went into the room above which was lighted cheerfully and hung with christmas there was chair set close beside the child and there were signs of some one having been there lately poor bob sat down in it and when he had thought little and composed himself he kissed the little face he was reconciled to what had happened and went down again quite happy they drew about the ﬁre and talked the girls and mother working still bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of scrooge s nephew whom he had scarcely seen but once and who meeting him in the street that day and seeing that he looked just little down you know said bob inquired what had happened to distress him on which said bob he is the gentleman you ever heard i told him i am heartily sorry it cratchit he said and heartily sorry your good by the bye how he ever knew that i don t know knew what my dear why that you were good wife replied bob everybody knows that said peter very well observed my boy cried bob i hope they heartily sorry he said your good wife if i can the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https service to you in any way he said giving his card that s where i live pray come to now it wasn t cried bob the sake of anything he might be able to us so much his kind way that this was quite delightful it really seemed if he had known our tiny tim and felt with i m sure he s good soul said cratchit you would be surer of it my dear returned bob if you saw and spoke to him i shouldn t be at all mark what i say he got peter better only hear that peter said cratchit and then cried one of the girls pete r will be keeping company with some one and setting up get along with you retorted peter grinning it s just likely not said bob one of these days though there s plenty of time that my dear but however and whenever we part from one another i am sure we shall none of us forget poor tiny this ﬁrst parting that there was among us never father cried they all and i know said bob i know my dears that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was although he was little little child we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves and get poor tiny tim in doing never father they all cried again i am very happy said little bob i am very happy cratchit kissed him his daughters kissed him the two young cratchits kissed him and peter and himself shook hands spirit of tiny tim thy childish essence was from god spectre said scrooge something informs that our parting moment is at hand i know it but i know not how tell what man that was whom we saw lying dead the ghost of christmas yet to come conveyed him at different time he thought indeed there seemed order in these latter visions save that they were in the the resorts of business men but showed him not himself indeed the spirit did not stay anything but went straight on to the end just now desired until besought by scrooge to tarry moment this court said scrooge through which we hurry now is where my place of occupation is and has been length of time i see the house let behold what i shall be in days to come the spirit stopped the hand was pointed elsewhere the house is yonder scrooge exclaimed why you point away the inexorable ﬁnger underwent change scrooge hastened to the window of his ofﬁce and looked in it was an ofﬁce still but not his the furniture was not the same and the ﬁgure in the chair was not himself the phantom pointed before he joined it once again and wondering why and whither he had gone accompanied it until they reached an iron the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https paused to look round before entering churchyard here then the wretched man whose name he had now to learn lay underneath the ground it was worthy place walled in by houses overrun by grass and weeds the growth of vegetation s death not life choked up with too much burying fat with repleted appetite worthy place the spirit stood among the graves and pointed down to one he advanced towards it trembling the phantom was exactly it had been but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape before i draw nearer to that stone to which you point said scrooge answer one question are these the shadows of the things that will be or are they shadows of things that may be only still the ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood men s courses will foreshadow certain ends to which if persevered in they must lead said scrooge but if the courses be departed from the ends will change say it is thus with what you show the spirit was immovable ever scrooge crept towards it trembling he went and following the ﬁnger read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name ebenezer s crooge the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https last of the spirits am i that man who lay upon the bed he cried upon his knees the ﬁnger pointed from the grave to him and back again spirit oh the ﬁnger still was there spirit he cried tight clutching at its robe hear i am not the man i was i will not be the man i must have been but this intercourse why show this if i am past all hope the ﬁrst time the hand appeared to shake good spirit he pursued down upon the ground he fell before it your nature intercedes and pities assure that i yet may change these shadows you have shown by an altered life the kind hand trembled i will honour christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year i will live in the past the present and the future the spirits of all three shall strive within i will not shut out the lessons that they teach oh tell i may sponge away the writing on this stone in his agony he caught the spectral hand it sought to free itself but he was strong in his entreaty and detained it the spirit stronger yet repulsed him holding up his hands in last prayer to have his fate reversed he saw an alteration in the phantom s hood and dress it shrunk collapsed and dwindled down into bedpost st ave five the end of it yes and the bedpost was his own the bed was his own the room was his own best and happiest of all the time before him was his own to make amends in i will live in the past the present and the future scrooge repeated he scrambled out of bed the spirits of all three shall strive within oh jacob marley heaven and the christmas time be praised this i say it on my knees old jacob on my knees he was so ﬂuttered and so glowing with his good intentions that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call he had been sobbing violently in his conﬂict with the spirit and his face was wet with tears they are not torn down cried scrooge folding one of his in his arms they are not torn down rings and all they are am shadows of the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https that would have been may be dispelled they will be i know they will his hands were busy with his garments all this time turning them inside out putting them on upside down tearing them mislaying them making them parties to every kind of extravagance i don t know what to cried scrooge laughing and crying in the same breath and making perfect laocoön of himself with his stockings i am light feather i am happy an angel i am merry schoolboy i am giddy drunken man merry christmas to everybody happy new year to all the world hallo here whoop hallo he had frisked into the and was now standing there perfectly winded there s the saucepan that the gruel was in cried scrooge starting off again and going round the

was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard clash clang hammer ding dong bell bell dong ding hammer clang clash oh glorious glorious running to the window he opened it and put out his head fog mist clear bright jovial stirring cold cold piping the blood to dance to golden sunlight heavenly sky sweet fresh air merry bells oh glorious glorious what

boy why christmas d it s christmas day said scrooge to himself i haven t missed it the spirits have done it all in one night they can anything they like of course they can of course they can hallo my ﬁne fellow hallo returned the boy you know the poulterer s in the next street but one at the corner scrooge inquired i should hope i did replied the lad an intelligent boy said scrooge remarkable boy you know whether they ve sold the prize turkey the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https hanging up there the little prize turkey the big one what the one big returned the boy what delightful boy said scrooge it s pleasure to talk to him yes my buck it s hanging there now replied the boy is it said scrooge go and buy er exclaimed the boy said scrooge i am in earnest

you the boy was off like shot he must have had steady hand at trigger who could have got shot of f half so fast i ll send it to bob cratchit s whispered scrooge rubbing his hands and splitting with laugh he sha n t know who sends it it s twice the size of tiny tim joe miller never made such joke sending it to bob s will be the hand in which he wrote the address was not steady one but write it he did somehow and went to open the street door ready the coming of the poulterer s man he stood there waiting his arrival the knocker caught his eye i shall love it long i live cried scrooge patting it with his hand i scarcely ever looked at it before what an honest expression it has in its face it s wonderful knocker s the turkey hallo whoop how are you merry christmas it was turkey he never could have stood upon his legs that bird he would have snapped short off in minute like sticks of why it s impossible to carry that to camden town said scrooge y must have the chuckle with which he said this and the chuckle with which he paid the turkey and the chuckle with which he paid the cab and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again and chuckled till he cried shaving was not an easy task his hand continued to shake very much and shaving requires attention even when you don t dance while you are at it but if he had cut the end of his nose off he would have put piece of plaister over it and been quite satisﬁed he dressed himself all in his best and at last got out into the streets the people were by this time pouring forth he had seen them with the ghost of christmas present and walking with his hands behind him scrooge regarded every one with delighted smile he looked so irresistibly pleasant in word that three or four fellows said good morning sir merry christmas to you and scrooge said often afterwards that of all the project gutenberg ebook of christmas carol by charles dickens https sounds he had ever heard those were the blithest in his ears he had not gone far when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman who had walked into his the day before and said scrooge and marley s i believe it sent pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met but he knew what path lay straight before him and he took it my dear sir said scrooge quickening his pace and taking the old gentleman by both his hands how you i hope you succeeded yesterday it was very kind of you merry christmas to you sir mr scrooge yes said scrooge that is my name and i fear it may not be pleasant to you allow to ask your pardon and will you have the goodness scrooge whispered in his ear lord bless cried the gentleman if his breath were taken away my dear mr scrooge are you serious if you please said scrooge not farthing less great many are included in it i assure you will you that favour my dear sir said the other shaking hands with him i don t know what to say to such don t say anything please retorted scrooge come and see will you come and see i will cried the old gentleman and it was clear he meant to it thank ee said scrooge i am much obliged to you i thank you ﬁfty times bless you he went to church and walked about the streets and watched the people hurrying to and fro and patted children on the head and questioned beggars and looked down into the kitchens of houses and up to the windows and found that everything could yield him pleasure he had never dreamed that any give him so much happiness in the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew s house he passed the door dozen times before he had the courage to go up and knock but he made dash and did it is your master at home my dear said scrooge to the girl nice girl very yes sir where is he my love said scrooge he s in the sir along with mistress i ll show you if you thank ee he knows said scrooge with his hand already on the lock i ll go in

see the alteration in him but he let them laugh and little heeded them he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe good at which some people did not have their ﬁll of laughter in the outset and knowing that such these would be blind anyway he thought it quite well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins have the malady in less attractive forms his own heart laughed and that was quite enough him he had further intercourse with spirits but lived upon the total abstinence principle ever afterwards and it was always said of him that he knew how to keep christmas
