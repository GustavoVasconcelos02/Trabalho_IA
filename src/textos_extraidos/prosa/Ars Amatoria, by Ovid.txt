when the ravished sabine fair 718 came to the aid of the solitary men then neither did curtains 719 hang over the marble theatre 720 nor was the stage 721 blushing with liquid saffron there the branches were simply arranged which the woody palatium bore the scene was void of art on the steps made of turf sit the people the branches promiscuously overshadowing their shaggy locks they look about them and they mark with their eyes each himself the damsel which to choose and in their silent minds they devise full many plan and while the etrurian piper sends forth his harsh notes the actor with his foot thrice beats the levelled ground in the midst of the applause in those days applause was void of guile the king gives to his people the signal to be awaited the spoil at once they start up and disclosing their intentions with shout lay their greedy hands upon the maidens 722 the doves startled throng ﬂy from the eagles and the young iamb ﬂies from the wolves when seen in such manner

spoke why spoil your charming eyes with tears what to your mother your father was the same will i be to you romulus was thou alone didst understand how to give rewards to thy soldiers give such reward

mistress there being one to prevent it press your side to her side close ever you can and conveniently enough because the partition 723 compels you to sit close even if she be unwilling and because by the custom of the place the fair one must be touched by you here let the occasion be sought by you some friendly chat and let the usual subjects 724 lead to the ﬁrst words take care and enquire with an air of anxiety whose horses those are coming and without delay whoever it is to whom she wishes well to him you also wish well but when the thronged procession shall walk with the holy statues of ivory 725 you applaud your mistress venus with zealous hand and often happens if perchance little dust should fall on the bosom of the fair it must be brushed off with your ﬁngers 726 and if there should be dust still brush off that none let any excuse be prelude to your attentions if her mantle hanging too low shall be trailing on the earth gather it up and carefully raise it from the dirty

graceful fan and to place the hollow footstool beneath her delicate feet both the circus and the sand spread its sad duties 730 in the bustling forum will afford these overtures to dawning passion on that sand oft has the son of venus fought and he who has come to be spectator of wounds himself receives wound 731 while he is talking and is touching her hand and is asking the racing list 732 and having deposited the stake 733 is enquiring which has conquered wounded he sighs and feels the ﬂying dart and himself becomes portion of the spectacle so viewed besides when of late 734 cæsar on the

conﬁdence then grief and cares and the wrinkles of the forehead depart then candour most uncommon in our age reveals the feelings the god expelling all guile on such occasions full oft have the fair captivated the hearts of the youths and venus amid wine has proved ﬂames in ﬂame here not you trust too much to the deceiving lamp 746 both night and wine are unsuited to judgment upon beauty in daylight and under clear sky did paris view the goddesses when he said to venus thou venus dost excel them both by night blemishes are concealed and pardon is granted to every imperfection and that hour renders every woman beauteous consult the daylight about jewels about wool steepe d in purple consult the daylight about the ﬁgure and the proportion why enumerate the resorts of fair ones suited your search the sands would yield to my number why mention baiæ 747 and the shores covered with sails and the waters which send forth the smoke from the warm sulphur many one carrying thence wound in his breast has exclaimed this water was not so wholesome it was said to be see too the temple in the grove of suburban diana and the realms acquired with the sword by hostile hand 748 because she is virgin because she hates the darts of cupid she has given many wound to the public and will give many still thus far thalia borne upon unequal wheels 749 teaches where the foeman hurls from his ﬂying steed stealthy courtship is pleasing to the man so too is it to the fair the man but unsuccessfully conceals his passion with more concealment does she desire were it agreed among the males not to be the ﬁrst to entreat any female the conquered fair would soon act the part of the suppliant in the balmy meads the female lows after the bull the female is always neighing after the horse passion in us is more enduring and not so violent among men the ﬂame has reasonable bounds why mention byblis who burned with forbidden passion her brother and who resolutely atoned with the halter her crimes myrrha loved her father but not daughter ought and she now lies hid overwhelmed by the bark 750 that grew over her with her tears too which she distils from the odoriferous tree are we perfumed and the drops still retain the name of their mistress by chance in the shady vales of the woody ida there was white hull the glory of the herd marked with little black in the middle between his horns

hated the beau teous cows i sing of facts well known crete which contains its hundred cities untruthful it is 752 can not gainsay them she herself is said to have cut down fresh leaves and the

it to put on those costly garm ents this love of thine understands nothing about wealth what hast thou to with mirror when accompanying the herds of the moun tain why foolish one art thou so often arranging thy smoothed locks still thou believe that mirror that denies that thou art heifer how much couldst thou wish horns to spring up upon thy forehead if minos still pleases thee let paramour be sought but if thou wouldst rather deceive thy husband deceive him through being that is human her chamber abandoned the queen is borne over the groves and the forests just bacchanal impelled by the aonian god alas how oft with jealous look does she eye cow and say why is she thus pleasing to my love see how she skips before him on the tender grass i make doubt that the fool thinks that it is becoming to her thus she spoke and at once ordered her to be withdrawn from the vast herd and in her innocence to be dragged beneath the bending yoke or else she forced her to fall before the altars and rites feigned the purpose and with joyous hand she held the entrails of her rival how often did she propitiate the deities with her slain rivals and say she held the entrails now go and charm my love and sometimes she begged that she might become europa sometimes io because the one was cow the other borne upon bull still deceived by cow made of the leader of the herd impregnated her and by the offspring was the sire 754 betrayed if the cretan dame 755 had withheld from love thyestes alas how hard it is woman possibly to be pleasing to one man only phoebus would not have interrupted his career in the midst and his chariot turned back retreated with his returning steeds to the morn the daughter who spoiled 756 nisus of his purple locks presses bene ath her thigh and groin the raving dogs the son of atreus who escaped from mars by land and neptune on the waves was the mournful victim of his wife by whom have not been lamented the ﬂames 757 of the ephyrean creusa medea the parent too stained with the blood of her children phoenix the son of amyntor 758 wept with his blinded eyes you startled steeds tore hippolytus in pieces why phineus dost thou tear out the eyes of thy guiltless sons 759 that punishment will revert to thy own head all these things have been caused by the passion of females it is more violent than ours and has more frenzy in it come then and doubt not that you can conquer all the fair out of so many there will be hardly one to deny you what they yield and what they refuse still are they glad to be asked even if you are deceived your repulse is without danger but why should you be deceived since new pleasures are delightful and since what is strange attracts the feelings more than what is one own 760 the crop 761 of corn is always more fertile in the ﬁelds of other people and the herds of our neighbours have their udders more distended but ﬁrst be it your care to make acquaintance with the handmaid of the fair one to be courted she can render your access easy 762 take care that she is deep in the secrets of her mistress and not too little entrusted with her secret frolics her you bribe with promises her with entreaties you will obtain what you ask with little trouble if she shall be willing let her choose the time physicians even watch their time when the feelings of her mistress are pliant and easy to be inﬂuenced then will her feelings be easily inﬂuenced when in the best humour in the world she shall be smiling just the corn on the rich soil while hearts are joyous and not closed by sadness then are they assailable then with soothing arts does venus steal on apace at the time when troy was in sorrow she was defended by arms when joyous she admitted the horse pregnant with its soldiers then too must she be assailed when she shall be fretting on being offended by rival then effect it by your means that she go not unrevenged let her handmaid she combs her hair in the morning urge her on and to the sail let her add the resources of the oar and sighing to herself let her say in gentle murmurs in my idea you yourself can not pay him in return 763 then let her talk about you then let her add persuasive expressions and let her swear that you are perishing with frantic passion but speed on let not the sails fall and the breezes lull like brittle ice anger disappears in lapse of time you inquire if it is of use 764 to win the handmaid herself in such attempts there is great risk this one becomes more zealous after an intrigue that one more tardy the one procures you gift her mistress the other her own self the result is doubtful although she should favour your advances still it is my advice to refrain from so doing i shall not go over headlong tracks and over sharp crags and under my guidance youth shall be deceived even if she pleases you while she gives and receives the letters by her person and not only by her zealousness alone take care ars amatoria by ovid https her mistress ﬁrst let the other follow her companion your courtship must not be commenced with this one thing i advise you if you only put some trust in my skill and if the boisterous wind does not bear my words over the seas either not attempt or else you persist the informer is removed when once she herself has shared in the criminality the bird does not easily escape when its wings are the boar does not readily get away from the loose nets the wounded ﬁsh can be held by the hook it has seized once tried press her hard and not retreat but the conqueror then guilty of fault that is common to you both she will not betray you and the sayings and doings of her mistress will be well known to you but let this be well concealed if your informant shall be well concealed your mistress will ever be under your eye he is mistaken who supposes that time is the object of those only who till the ﬁelds and is to be observed by mariners alone neither must the corn be always trusted to the treacherous soil nor the hollow ships at all times to the green waves nor is it safe to be ever angling the charming fair the same thing may often be better done when an opportunity offers whether it is her birthday 765 that comes or whether the calends 766 which venus delights to have the successor of the month of mars or whether the circus shall be adorned not with statues it was before but shall be containing the wealth of kings 767 exposed to view delay your project then the storm is boisterous then the pleiades prevail 768 then the tender kid is sinking in the ocean wave then is well to desist then if one trusts the deep with difﬁculty he grasps the shipwrecked fragments of his dismantled bark you may make beginning on the day on which tearful allia 769 was stained with the blood of the latian wounds on the day too when the festival recurs observ ed each seventh day by the syrian of palestine day not suited 770 the transaction of business great must be 771 your dread of the birthday of your mistress and unlucky be that day on which any present must be made though you should cleverly avoid her still she will spoil you woman ﬁnds contrivances by means of which to plunder the riches of the eager lover the pedlar 772 will be coming to your mistress so fond of buying and while you are by will be exposing his wares she wills ask you to examin them only that you may appear to be knowing then she will give you kiss and then entreat you to purchase she will swear that she will be content with this many year she will say that now she has need of it now it may be bought bargain if you shall make the excuse that you have not the money at home to give promissory note 773 will be asked it would then proﬁt you not to have learned 774 to write besides too when she asks present though the cake 775 and is born her own pleasure often she pleases and further when full of tears she laments her pretended loss and the jewel 776 is feigned to have fallen from her pierced ear they ask many sum to be lent

that feign you to be in love and entreaties not few achilles moved with his entreaties granted hector to priam an angered divinity is moved by the voice of entreaty take care to make promises what harm is there in promising any person whatever can be rich in promises hope if she is only once cherished holds out long time she is indeed deceitful goddess but still convenient one should you give her 777 anything you may that reason be abandoned by her she will bear off the gift and will have lost nothing in return but that which you have not given you may always seem though about to give thus has the sterile ﬁeld full oft deceived its owner so the gambler in order that he may not lose does not cease to lose and the alluring dice ever recall the anxious hand this is the task this the labour to gain her without even the ﬁrst present what she has once given she will always give that she may not have granted to purpose let the letter go then and let it be couched in tender expressions and let it ascertain her feelings and be the ﬁrst to feel its way letter borne upon an apple 778 deceived cydippe and by her own words the fair was unconsciously caught youths of rome learn i recommend you the liberal arts and not only that you may defend the trembling accused both the public and the grave judge and the silent senate well the fair conquered by your eloquence shall extend their hands 779 but let your power lie concealed and not be eloquent at the ﬁrst let your letters avoid difﬁcult words who but one bereft of sense would declaim before charming mistress full oft has letter proved powerful cause hatred let your language be intelligible and your words the usual ones but pleasing so that you may ars amatoria by ovid https be speaking in person should she not accept your letter and send it back unread hope that she will read it and persist in your design in time the stubborn oxen come beneath the ploughs in time the steeds are taught to submit to the ﬂowing reins by continued use the ring of iron 780 is consumed by being in the ground continually the crooked plough is worn out what is there harder than stone what more yielding than water yet hard stones are hollowed out by yielding water only persist and in time you will overcome penelope herself you see that pergamus was taken after long time still it was taken if she reads it and will not write in answer not attempt to compel her you only make her to be continually reading your ﬂattering lines what she has been pleased to read she will be pleased to answer when read all these things will come in their turn and by degrees perhaps even at ﬁrst discouraging letter will come to you and one that entreats you not to wish to molest her what she entreats you to she dreads what she does not entreat you to namely to persist she wishes you to press on and soon you will be the gainer of your desires in the meantime if she shall be carried lying along upon her couch you though quite by accident approach the litter of your mistress and that one may give mischievous ear to your words cunningly conceal them so far you can in doubtful signs if with sauntering foot the spacious portico is paced by her here too you bestow your leisure in her attendance and sometimes you take care to go before sometimes follow behind and sometimes be in hurry and sometimes walk leisurely and be not ashamed to

fair to and any man that perchance disgracefully seeks to attract another lo bacchus calls his own poet he too aids those who love and he encourages the ﬂame with which he burns himself the gnossian fair was wandering distractedly on the unknown sands where little dia is beaten by the ocean waves and just she was on awaking from her sleep 790 clothed in loose tunic with bare feet and having her yellow hair loose she was exclaiming to the deaf waves that theseus was cruel while the piteous shower of tears was moistening her tender cheeks she exclaimed and at the same moment she wept but both became her nor was she rendered unsightly by her tears and now again beating her most beauteous bosom with her hands she cried that perﬁdious man has gone what will become of what will become of she said when cymbals resounded over all the shore and tambourines were beaten with frantic hand she dropped down with alarm and stopped short in her closing words and blood was there in her lifeless body see the mimallonian females 791 with their locks ﬂowing on their backs see the nimble satyrs the throng preceding the god sec silenus the drunken old man 792 on his bending ass sits there with difﬁculty and holds fast by the mane that he presses while he follows the bacchanals the bacchanals both ﬂy and return while the unskilful rider is goading on his animal with his stick slipping from the ass he tumbles upon his head the satyrs cry aloud come rise up rise father now the god from his chariot the top of which he had wreathed with grapes loosened the golden reins the tigers yoked to it both her complexion and theseus and her voice forsook the fair one and thrice she attempted ﬂight and thrice was she detained by fear she shuddered just the barren ears of corn which the wind shakes just the slender reed quivers in the swampy ars amatoria by ovid https her the divinity said lo i come to thee more constant lover damsel of gnossus lay aside thy fear the wife of bacchus shalt thou be receive heaven my gift conspicuous constellation in the heavens full oft cretan diadem 793 shalt thou direct the veering bark thus he said and he leapt from the chariot that she might not be in dread of the tigers the sand yielded to his foot placed upon it and folding her in his bosom he bore her off to struggle she was unable how easy is god to be able to anything some sing hymenæus some cry evie evoë 794 thus are the god and his bride united in holy wedlock therefore when the gifts of bacchus placed before you fall to your lot and the fair one shall be sharer in the convivial couch pray both to father nyctelius and his nocturnal rites that they will bid the wine not to take effect on your head here in secret discourse you may say to her many free word which she may understand is addressed to her and you may trace out short compliments with little wine so that she may read on the table 795 that she is your favorite and look on her eyes with eyes that confess your ﬂame the silent features often have both words and expression take care to be the next to seize the cup that has been touched by her lips and drink from the side 796 that the fair drinks from and whatever food she shall have touched with her ﬁngers 797 you reach it and while you are reaching her hand may be touched by you let it also be your object to please the husband of the fair once made

your neighbour let him help himself to every thing ﬁrst and not hesitate to speak only after he has spoken secure and much frequented is the path deceiving through the name of friendship secure and much frequented though that path be still it is to be condemned this cause is that the agent attends even too much 799 to his agency and thinks that more things ought to be looked after by him than those entrusted to him sure rule drinking shall be given you by let both your mind and your feet ever observe their duty especially avoid quarrels stimulated by wine and hands too ready savage warfare eurytion 801 met his death from foolishly quafﬁng the wine set before him banquets and wine are rather suited pleasant mirth if you have voice sing if pliant arms dance and by whatever talent you can

oft he becomes that which in the beginning he feigned to be this cause the rather ye fair be propitious to those who pretend that passion will become real which so lately was feigned now be it your part stealthily to captivate her affection by attentions just the shelving bank is encroached on by the ﬂowing stream be not tired of praising either her face or her hair her taper ﬁngers too and her small foot the praise of their beauty pleases even the chaste their charms are the care and the pleasure of even maide ns why even now are juno and pallas ashamed at not having gained the decision in

attachments that are ﬁrmly united this those of long duration these faults must then be guarded against by cautious men but still my judgment does not condemn you to one fair alone the gods forbid hardly can the married woman adhere to this disport yourself but let your faultiness be concealed by decent stealthiness glory must be sought in one own delinquency and you give present of which the

you shall be writing you ﬁrst examine the whole of the tablet many woman reads more than what has been sent to her slighted passion brandishes the arms of retribution and hurls back the weapon and causes yourself to complain of that of which it complained so lately so long the son of atreus was content with one woman she too was chaste through the fault of her husband did she become culpable she had heard how that chryses bearing in his hand the laurel and the ﬁllets had not prevailed in behalf of his daughter she had heard too ravished one of lyrnesus of thy sorrows and how the warfare

if perchance any of them are discovered although they should be notorious still you always deny them on such occasions you neither be subdued nor more kind than usual that bears the marks of mind that

sometimes with the east wind full aft does the canvass swell with the zeph yrs with the south wind full aft see how in the chariot the driver at one moment gives the ﬂowing rein at another skilfully checks the horses in full career there are some with whom an anxious obsequiousness is ruinous and if there is rival existing then their passion waxes faint the feelings often run riot amid prosperity and to bear good fortune with equanimity is easy task the declining ﬁre its strength consuming by degrees itself lies concealed and the ashes become white over the surface of the ﬁre but still when sulphur is applied it ﬁnds the ﬂames that were extinguished and the light returns which existed before so when ars amatoria by ovid https sluggish through repose and free from care become torpid by
