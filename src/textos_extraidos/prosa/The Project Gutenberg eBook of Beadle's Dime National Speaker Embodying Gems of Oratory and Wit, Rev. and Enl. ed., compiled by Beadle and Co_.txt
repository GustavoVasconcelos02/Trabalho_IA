and sound policy than those fervid spirits who dwell exclusively in the present and make less allowance the gradual operation of moral inﬂuences this was the case in reference to the great sectional controversy which now so sharply divides and so violently agitates the country he not only conﬁdently anticipated what the lapse of seven years since his decease has witnessed and is witnessing that the newly acqui red and the newly organized territories of the union would grow up into free states but in common with all or nearly all the statesmen of the last generation he believed that free labor would ultimately prevail throughout the country he thought he saw that in the operation of the same causes which have produced this result in the middle and eastern states it was visibly taking place in the states north of the region and he inclined to the opinion that there also under the inﬂuence of physical and economical causes free labor would eventually be found more productive and would therefore be ultimately established these reasons bearing in mind what all admit that the complete solution of the mighty problem which now so greatly tasks the prudence and patriotism of the wisest and best in the land is beyond the delegated powers of the general governme nt that it depends far the states are concern ed on their independent legislation and that it is of all others

passionate sectional agitation which between the extremes of opinion leaves middle ground moderate counsels if any one could have found and could have trodden such ground with success he would seem to

perfect rose in short i am commonly known by the appellation of the bashful man the consciousness of this unhappy failing made formerly avoid that social company i should otherwise have been ambitious to appear in till at length becoming possessed of an ample fortune by the death of rich old uncle and vainly supposing that money makes the man i was now determined to shake off my natural timidity and join in the gay throng with this view i accepted of an invitation to dine with one whose open easy manner left room to doubt of cordial welcome sir thomas friendly an intimate friend of my late uncle with two sons and ﬁve daughters all grown up and living with their mother and maiden sister of sir thomas conscio us of my unpolished gait i some time took private lessons of professor who teaches grown gentlemen to dance having by this means acquired the art of walking without tottering and learning to make bow i boldly ventured to obey the baronet invitatio n to family dinner not doubting but my new acquirements would enable to see the ladies with tolerable intrepidity but alas how vain are all the hopes of theory when unsupported by habitual practice i approached the house dinner alarmed my fears lest i had spoiled the dinner by want of punctuality impressed with this idea i blushed the deepest crimson my name was repeatedly announced by the several who ushered into the library hardly knowing what or whom i saw at my ﬁrst entrance i summoned all my fortitude and made my bow to lady friendly but unfortunately in bringing my left foot to the third position i trod upon the gouty toe of poor sir thomas who had followed close to my heels to be the nomenclato r of the family the confusion this occasioned in is hardly to be conceived since none but bashful men can judge of my distress and of that description the number i believe is very small the baronet politeness by degrees dissipated my concern and i was astonished to see how far good breeding could enable him to support his feelings and to appear with perfect ease after so painful an accident the cheerfulness of her ladyship and the familiar chat of the young ladies insensibly led to throw off my reserve and sheepishness till at length i ventured to join in conversation and even to start fresh subjects the library being richly furnished with books in elegant bindings and observi ng an edition of xenophon

to look like sixteen volumes came tumbling down and unluckily pitched upon wedgewood inkstand on the table under it in vain did sir thomas assure there was harm i saw the ink streaming from an inlaid

rekindled all my heat and blushes having set my plate of soup too near the edge of the table in bowing to miss dinah who politely complimented the pattern of my waistcoat i tumbled the whole scalding contents into my lap in spite of an immediate supply of napkins to wipe the surface of my clothes my black silk breeches were not stout enough to save from the painful effects of this sudden fomentation and some minutes my legs and thighs seemed stewing in boiling caldron but recollecting how sir thomas had disguised his torture when i trod upon his toe i ﬁrmly bore my pain in silence and sat with my lower extremities parboiled amidst the stiﬂed giggling of the ladies and servants i will not relate the several blunders which i made during the ﬁrst course or the distress occasioned by my being desired to carve fowl or help to various dishes that stood near spilling and knocking down rather let hasten to the second course where fresh disasters overwhelmed quite i had piece of rich sweet pudding on my fork when miss louisa friendly begged to trouble pigeon that stood near in my haste scarcely knowing what i did i whipped the pudding into my mouth hot burning coal it was impossible to conceal my eyes were starting from their sockets at last in spite of shame and resolution i was obliged to drop the cause of my torment on my plate sir thomas and the ladies all compassionated my misfo rtune and each advised different application one recommended oil another water but all agreed that wine was the best drawing out ﬁre and glass of sherry was brought from the which i snatched up with eagerness but oh how shall i tell the sequel whether the butler by accident mistook or purposely designed to drive mad he gave the strongest brandy with which i ﬁlled my mouth already ﬂayed and blistered totally unused to ardent spirits with my tongue throat and palate raw beef what could i i could not swallow but clapping my hands upon my mouth the cursed liquor squirted through my nose and ﬁngers like fountain over all the dishes and i crushed by bursts of laughter from all quarters in vain did sir thomas reprimand the servants and lady friendly chide her daughters the measure of my shame and their diversion was not yet complete to relieve from the intolerable state of perspiration which this accident had caused without considering what i did i wiped my face with that handkerchief which was still wet from the consequences of the fall of xenophon and covered all my features with streaks of ink in every direction the baronet himself could not support this shock but joined his lady in the general laugh while i sprung from the table in despair rushed out of the house and ran home in an agony of confusion and disgrace which the most poignant sense of guilt could have excited thus without having deviated from the path of moral rectitude i am suffering torments like goblin damned the lower half of has been almost boiled my tongue and mouth grilled

infinite that is to every thing created useful which enables it rightly and fully to perform the functions appointed to it by its creator therefore that we may determine what is chieﬂy useful to man it is necessary ﬁrst to determine the use of man himself man use and function is to be the witness of the glory of god and to advance that glory by his reasonable obedience and resultant happiness whatever enables us to fulﬁll this function is in the pure and ﬁrst sense of the word useful to us therefore what sets the glory of god more brightly before us but things that only help us to exist are in secondary and mean sense useful or rather if they be looked alone they are useless and worse it would be better that we should not exist than that we should guiltily disappoint the purposes of existence and yet people speak in this working age when they speak from their hearts if houses and lands and food and raiment were alone useful and if sight thought and admiration were all proﬁtless so that men insolently call themselves utilitari ans who would turn if they had their way them selves and their race into vegetables men who think that the meat is more than the life and the raiment than the body who look to the earth stable and to its fruit fodder husbandmen who love the corn they grind and the grapes they crush better than the gardens of the angels upon the slopes of eden hewers of wood and drawers of water who think that the wood they hew and the water they draw are better than the pine forests that cover the mountains like the shadow of god and than the great rivers that move like his eternity and so comes upon us that woe of the preacher that though god hath made every thing beauti ful in his time also he hath set the world in their hearts so that man can ﬁnd out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end this nebuchadnezzar curse that sends us to grass like oxen seems to follow but too closely on the excess or continuance of national power and peace in the perplexities of nations in their struggles existence in their infancy their impotence or even their disor ganization they have higher hopes and nobler passions out of the suffering comes the serious mind out of the salvation the grateful heart out of the endurance the fortitude out of the deliverance the faith but now when they have learned to live under providence of laws and with decency and justice and regard each other and when they have done away with violent and external sources of suffering worse evils seem rising out of their that vex less and mortify more that suck the blood though they not shed it and ossify the heart though they not torture it and deep though the causes of thankfulness must be to every people at peace with others and at unity in itself there are causes of fear also fear greater than the sword and sedition that dependence on god may be forgotten because the bread is given and the water is sure that gratitude to him may cease because his constancy of protection has taken the semblance of natural law that heavenly hope may grow faint amidst the full fruition of the world that selﬁshness may take place of undemanded devotion compassion be lost in vainglory and love in dissimulation that innovation may succeed to strength apathy to patience and the noise of jesting words and foulness of dark thoughts to the earnest purity of the girded loins and the burning ruskin the language of the eagle it is one of the difﬁculties of those who undertake to make public speeches that sometimes they are embarrassed about the heads of their discourses and so i am somewhat troubled at ﬁnding the inferior position of the american eagle inasm uch he has but one head while the russian eagle has two i suppose that the explanation of this pg 87 pg 88 the project gutenberg ebook of beadle dime national speaker embodying gems of oratory and wit rev and enl compiled by https difference arises from the necessity of the russian eagle having one head to watch over his large possessions in asia and the other head to look after his small property in europe i feel good deal of conﬁdence in speaking of the american eagle in contrast i can see that if the american eagle has but one head it embodies therein the national sentiment now prevailing of one country and one people it is very true that our brethren of the i still call them our been under the impression that ours was eagle with northern and southern head with this distinction over the russian that the southern was the larger and more important head of the two and we are now engaged in the somewhat expensive and troublesome task of correcting that mistake in natural histo ry there is good deal that is appropriate and sometimes something that is suggestive in these national symbols the lion instance is very hungry beast and the large portion of the globe which he has got into his possession shows the appropriateness of the selection of the symbol the cock we know is very boisterous and demonstrative bird who never does anything that he does not make noise about and certainly the gallic neighbor of the english lion has never been distinguished his modesty whenever he has accomplished any thing in arts or in arms the eagle is bird and i had better bring before you what an english poet says of him he clasps the crag with hooked hands close to the sun in lonely lands ringed in an azure world he stands the wrinkled sea beneath him crawls he watches from his mountain walls and like thunderbolt he falls if the illustration had been carried further we might be content with this english authority that the eagle typical of russia and of the united states is to be armed with that thunderbolt which the greeks thought to be the prerogative of jupiter the american eagle has been distinguished the quickness of his ﬂight and i not think that our bitterest enemies can ever bring against us the charge of slowness there are some points of resemblance between the united states and russia russia like us is made up of many nationalities and we have had recently the most satisfactory evidence that the russian eagle is soaring in the same quarter we beyond the crowing of the cock or the roaring of the lion in conclusion the eagle was an old symbol the egyptians had it the persians had it the romans after trying four or ﬁve other animals took it in the time i think of marius therefore it is one of the oldest illustrations of national importance i indulge in the sentiment that the eagle now represents the nations of russia and the united states it may at least be one among the judge daly of new y ork washingt on cox all over the world examples may be found which are lessons to us could you go to naples you will ﬁnd beyond the grotto

but lost pleiad in our american constellation america england dudley field it has been said that if new dictionary were now to be published in england another deﬁnition of neutrality would have to be given certain it is that much of what has taken place on the other side of the ocean during this unhappy war comports little with our previous understanding of the duties of neutrals and yet strict neutrality between belligerents is enjoined much by philanthropy by national honor while it protects national independence it restricts the limits of war it is thus rule alike of justice and of prudence it springs from principles which lie at the foundation of international law that is to say the independence and the equality of nations but there is another rule which springs from the same principles and which is old and strong that of neutrality and is sometimes confounded with is the duty of every nation to abstain from any interference with the internal concerns of another to be neutral between two belligerents is to help neither to make or help to make two bellig erents out of the same nation is to interfere in its internal relations if it be said that this is but to recognize and declare fact i answer that the nation itself it is equal and independent is the sole judge of the fact the relation of the different parts with each other is domestic concern to assume to recogn ize and declare relations which it does not ﬁrst recognize and declare is equally with the violation of neutrality departure from that courtesy and deference which are due from one nation to another both depend upon that public law of the world which is old governments and eternal equity nation is so ancient or mighty to be above it none so young or weak to be below it pg 91 pg 92 the

these rules the government of this country has followed at all times and under all circumstances whatever may have been the sympathies of our people what ever may have been the moral aspects of the forei gn wars on which they have looked and however much they have desired the success of one party over the other they have inﬂexibly refused to throw their powers into the scale or to allow any of their citizens to violate the neutrality which the government enjoined from the administration of washing ton to the administration of lincoln through all the wars of the french republic and the french empire through the struggles of master y in eastern europe through the great civil wars in poland in hungary and in india we have steadily asserted the policy of interference and maintained it in practice and we have never resorted to the paltry evasion of doing secretly what we professed openly to avoid what we said we meant and what we meant we said we have held the obligation to be paramount and universal we complain of england and france ﬁrst the proclamation or profession of neutrality and then the violation of the neutrality thus professed this is not the place to enter upon the reasons which justify these complaints the loyal people of this country have made up their opinions on both these subjects they are convinced that england and france have wronged them in both respects and are just strongly convinced that russia whose naval ofﬁcers are our guests has acted differently has done us injury has conformed her conduct to the solemn injunctions of the law of nations in accounting us competent to manage our own affairs treating the establi shed and recognized government of the country the only lawful belligerent and holding relations whatever with the rebels it is impossible to mistake the settled convictions of the american people they will never forget through all the changes of future years that in their mortal struggle the czar has been true to them and in the exercise of his great ofﬁce has been inﬂexible in his adherence to the grand and salutary principles of public law and they will just surely never cease to believe that the governments of england and france have desired the disruption of the republic and have hastened unjustly to lift the rebels into the condition of legal belligerents have offensively professed neutrality between the lawful and the rebel forces and after all have evaded that professed neutrality by every species of indirect assistance which it was possible to give short of engaging in hostilities these things will never be forgotten so long americans can read and remember and more than this the men of this generation who have smarted under these wrongs will not rest until some of them are righted we see the ground fresh with graves half of which would never have been opened but the countenan ce which england and france have given to the rebellion and whether it shall be procured from their apprehension of the consequences or their sense of justice reparation must be made or the seed which has been sown in these three years will ripen into an iron harvest of futur war of which man can
