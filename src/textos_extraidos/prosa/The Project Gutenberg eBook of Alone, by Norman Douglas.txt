were what visionaries to imagine that in such an hour of emer gency man might discover himself to be ﬁtted some work of national utility without that preliminary which was essential in humdrum times of peace how we lingered in long queues and stamped up and down and sat about crowded stuf fy halls waiting only waiting to be asked to something our country by any little guttersnipe who happened to have been jockeyed into the requisite position of authority what innocents i have memories of several afternoons spent at pleasant place near james park station whither i went in search of patriotic employment it was called i think board of trade labour emer gency bureau or something equally lucid and concise and professed to ﬁnd work everybody here in ﬁxed number of rooms sat an uncertain number of chubby young gentlemen all of whom seemed to be of military age or possibly below it the emer gency bureau was then plainly it may have changed later on hastily improvised shelter privileged sucklings kind of nursery on advanced montessori methods well that was not my concern one must trust the government to know its own business during my second or third visit to this hygienic and establishment i was introduced most fortunately into the sanctuary of mr r whose name was familiar to was he not his brother brother he was real stroke of luck r pink little thing laid down the pen he had snatched up i entered the room and began gazing at quizzically through enormous goggles after the fashion of precocious infant who tries to look like daddy what might he i the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https had short talk during which various forms were conscientiously ﬁlled up to my qualiﬁcations such they were of course there was nothing doing just then but one never knows does one would i mind calling again would i mind i should think not i should like nothing better it did one good to be in contact with this youthful optimist and listen to his blithe and pleasing prattle he was so hopeful so philosophic so cheery his whole nature seemed to exhale the golden words never say die and wonder he ought to have been at the front but some guardian angel in the haute ﬁnance had dumped him into this soft and safe job it was enough to make anybody cheerful one should be cautious none the less how one criticises the action of the authorities may be they kept him at the emer gency bureau the express purpose of infusing conﬁdence by his bright manner into the minds of despondent patriots like myself and of keeping the ﬂag ﬂying in general way task which he german jew was ﬁtted be that it may his consolatory tactics certainly succeeded in my case and i went home quite infected with his rosy cheeks and words yet on the occasion of my next visit week or two later there was still nothing doing not just then though one never knows does one tried the war ofﬁce he added airily i had who had the war ofﬁce was nightmare in those early days it resembled liverpool street station on the evening of rainless bank holiday the only clear memory i carried away and even this may have been due to some hallucination was that of voice shouting at through the rabble can you ﬂy such was my confusion that i believe i answered in the negative thereby losing probably lucrative billet chaplain to the forces or veterinary surgeon in the church lads brigade things might have been dif ferent had my distinguished cousin still been on the spot i too might have been accommodated with big desk and small work after the manner of the genial r he died in harness unfortunately soon after the outbreak of war i said to my young friend everybody tells one to try the war ofﬁce i know why of course i tried it i wish i had shilling every hour i wasted in that lunatic asylum ah he replied i feel sure good many men would like to be paid at that rate anyhow trust we ﬁx you up sooner or later he kept his word why not have whack at the f meanwhile because i have already had whack at it i then possessed indeed in reply to an application on my part holograph of twelve pages in the elegant calligraphy of under of state foreign affairs the same gentleman who was viciously attacked by the pankhurst section his supposed it conveyed grain of hope other government departments he opined might well be depleted at this moment the foreign ofﬁce was in exactly the reverse position it overﬂowed with diplomatic and consular ofﬁcials returned perforce from belligerent countries and now in search of occupation was it not natural was it not right to give the preference to them one was really at loss to the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https to with all those people he had tried hitherto in vain to ﬁnd some kind of job his own brother straightforward convincing statement acting on the hint i visited the education ofﬁce notoriously overstaf fed since tudor days it might now be emptier clerical work might be obtained there in substitution of some youngster who had been induced to join the colours i poked my nose into countless recesses and ﬁnally unearthed my man they were full up said mr f full up full up then after some further conversation to my capacities he thought he might ﬁnd employment teacher of science in the country to replace somebody or other the notion was distasteful to i am not averse to learning from the young i only once tried to teach them at ragged school long since pulled down near ladbroke grove where i soon discovered that my little pupils knew great deal more than i did more indeed than was good body or soul still this was tangible deﬁnite of fer of unremunerative but at the same time work not to be sneezed at an idea occurred to supposing i stick it out and give satisfaction shall i be able to interchange later into this department i am more ﬁtted ofﬁce duties in fact i have had certain experience of them chance of that he replied it is the german system their schoolmasters are sometimes taken to administrative work at and vice versâ our english rule is once teacher always teacher here was deadlock in such matters teaching man may put strain on himself certain length of time he may even be success up to point but if he lacks the temperamental gift of holding classes the results in the long run will not be fair to the children to say nothing of himself with reluctance i rose to depart mr f adding by way of letting down gently tried the war ofﬁce i had if the war ofﬁce was too lively this place was too slumberous by half cobwebby atmosphere brooded about those passages and chambers one could not help thinking that little german system might work wonders here and this is merely one of several similar sites i explored and endeavoured to exploit patriotic purposes i am here only jotting down few of the more important of those that occur to and oh the brush of hogarth to depict the gallery of faces with which i came in contact i went along they were all dif ferent yet all alike dif ferent in their degrees of beeﬁness stolidity and but plainly of the same parentage british to the backbone british of the wrong kind with sprinkling of welshmen irishmen and jews not scotsman discoverable in that whole mob of complacent my countrymen were the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https their absence they were otherwise engaged in the ﬁeld the colonies the i can only remember one single exception to this rule this type it was the head of the censorship department of course i of fered my services there climbing up that decent stairway and glad to ﬁnd myself among respectable surroundings after all the unseemly holes i had lately wallowed in i sent up card which to my surprise caused to be ushered forthwith into the presence of the chief who may have heard of my existence from some mutual friend here at all events was man with face worth looking at man who had done notable things in his day what relief moreover to be able to talk to gentleman change i wished i could have had him to myself ﬁve minutes there were one or two things one would have liked to learn from him unfortunately he was surrounded such people are by half dozen of the characteristic masks the rest his seemed to be inef fably bored with his new functions what on earth brings you here he began in fascinatingly style if he had known all my life and with an inimitable nasal drawl this is rotten job my dear sir rotten i can not recommend it not your style at all i should say but my dear sir f i am not applying your job something subordinate i mean anything anything what down there cutting up newspapers at shillings week let have your address and we will communicate with you when we ﬁnd something worth your while by the way have you tried the war ofﬁce i had and it stands to reason that i tried the munitions more than once it was my rare good fortune luck pursued on these patriotic expeditions to come face to face at the munitions with the fons et origo the deputy that is to say very peculiar that department he was perpendicular personality if i remember rightly who smelt of some indif ferent hair and lost time in giving you to understand that he was preternaturally busy did i know anything about machinery nothing to speak of i replied and proprietor of some cotton mills employing several hundred hands spinning and weaving i naturally learnt how to handle fair number of machines sufﬁciently well at all events to start and stop them and tell the girls how to avoid being scalped or having their arms torn out whenever i happened to be passing that way this life also gave some experience useful perhaps at the munitions in dealing with that was not the kind of machinery he meant did i know anything about banking nothing at all you are like everybody else he replied with weary sigh much to say how am i going to run the british empire with collection of imbeciles like this w have several thousands of applicants like yourself he went on but i will put your name down come again the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https you are very kind call again he added in his best manner i called again couple of weeks later it struck namely that they might have acquired sufﬁcient stock of bankers and mechanics by this time and be able possibly to discover vacancy man with fairish knowledge of the world and some other things one who moreover had himself served in cranky and fussy government department and though working in another sphere had been thanked ofﬁcially certain labours once by the admiralty twice by the board of trade and anyway hang it one was not so infernally venerable all that was one i called about fortnight ago you have my name down oh yes yes yes yes yes we have such thousands of applicants i remember you mechanic are you and you asked if i understood banking and i said i did what pity now if you knew about banking nothing evidently had been done about my application nor that matter about those thousands of others we were being played with i began to feel grumpy it was lovely afternoon and i remembered with regret that i had thrown over an engagement to go walk with friend at wimbledon about this hour i calculated we should be strolling along beverley brook or through the glades of coombe woods with sunshine ﬁltering through the birches overhead it would have been more pleasant and far more instructive than wasting my time with automaton like this that comes i thought of being patriotic i observed your department seems to require only bankers and mechanics would it not be well to advertise the fact and save trouble and time to those thousands of applicants who you say are in the same predicament myself i came here to national work of some general kind so i gather and if you understood banking if i did i should be banker at my time of life you see and lending money to you people and giving you good advice instead of asking you employment is that fairly obvious matter of fact my acquaintance with banking is limited to knowledge of how to draw cheques and even that useful accomplishment is fast fading from my memory under the stress of the times being welshman so i presume from his name he condescended to smile faintly but not long his salary was too high myself i refrained from saying few harsher things i was minded to say indeed i made myself so vastly agreeable after my own private recipe that he was quite touched he remarked i think i had better put your name down although we have thousands of applicants you know call again wo you which i humbly thanked him instead of saying i ought to have done you go to blazes the public is pack of idiots to run after people who merely keep them loitering about while they feather their own nests we the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https to lick the germans and yours is not the way to it did i understand banking the full ineptitude of this conundrum only dawned upon by degrees manifestly if i understood banking i might some specialised kind of work the government but in that case i would not apply to the munitions granted they wanted bankers well there was my friend m renowned in the city genius banking he could have saved them untold thousands of pounds they would have none of him they sent him into the trenches where he was duly shot how easy it is disappointed to jibe and rail against the powers that be especially when he is not in full possession of the data all i know they may have discovered my friend m to be dangerous character and have been only too glad to remove him out of society without unnecessary fuss in an outwardly honourable fashion with view to saving his poor but respectable parents the humiliating experience of criminal trial and possible execution in the family if i understood banking why did they want bankers at this institution ah it was not my business to probe into such mysteries of administration to my limited intelligence it would seem that the mere fact of man applying at the munitions was primâ facie evidence that banking was not one of his accomplishments it seemed to furthermore that there was end to such ifs patriotic or otherwise if i were woman instance i would promptly aid the cause by jumping into nurse outﬁt telling improper stories to the tommies and getting myself photographed the press every morning but i am only man if i were trumpeter i could qualify job in one of the allied armies or failing that on judgment day but i can only strum the piano and if the moon were made of green cheese we might all try to get hold of slice of it might we such was my pigheadedness my boyish zeal my belief in human nature or perverse sense of duty that i actually broke my vow and returned to that ridiculous establishment yes i called again ﬂattering myself with the conjecture that even if they had not yet obtained requisite amount of bankers and mechanics and even if persons of my particular aptitudes were still drug in the market there might nevertheless be room amid the ramiﬁcations and interstices of so great department man or two who could help to count up or pack munitions or if that proposal were hopelessly wide of the mark the services of something even more recondite and exotic an intelligent instance or half dozen astrologers i felt i could distinguish myself at national crisis like this in either capacity anyhow it was only one more afternoon wasted one out of how many this time i saw mr w though i had never met him in the ﬂesh i once enjoyed the privilege of perusing manuscript from his pen story about girl in kew gardens young hebrew was mr w he had made himself indispensable somehow or other to the minister and would doubtless by this time have been pitchforked into some permanent and prominent job but that unfortunate name of his with its strong teutonic ﬂavour this by the way was about the eighth ofﬁcial of his tribe and of his age i had come across in the course of my recent peregrinations how did they get there tell who can far be it from to disparage the race of israel i have gained the conviction now the polar star that the hebrew is good man the christian yet one would like to know their method their technique in this instance how was the thing done how the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https manage it these young jews all and of military age how did they contrive to keep out of the army was there some secret society which protected them or were they all so preposterously clever that the old country would straightway evaporate into thin air unless they sat in some comfortable ofﬁce while our own youngsters were being blown to pieces out yonder w i regret to say was not good oriental he lacked the semite pliability he was graceful but not gracious consequence doubtless of having inhaled some time past the rareﬁed atmosphere of the chief and swallowed few pokers during the process his manner towards was freezingly worthy of the best traditions had i come little earlier he avowed he might perhaps have been able to squeeze into one of his departments thus spake this infant one of my departments it was he feared there was nothing doing nothing whatsoever not just then tried the war ofﬁce i had i even visited though only twice an of fshoot of that establishment in victoria street near the army and navy stores where candidates the position of translator work and passable pay ﬁve pounds week were interviewed on the second occasion after waiting in an full of bearded and monsters such haunt the british museum library i was summoned before board of reverend elders who put through catechism drowsy but prolonged to my qualiﬁcations and antecedents it was systematic af fair could i decipher german manuscripts let them show their toughest one i said it was merely pro forma question they had enough german translators on the staf so the interrogation went on they were going to make sure of their man in whom i must say they took little interest save when they learnt that he had passed civil service examination in russian and another in international law at that moment though i may be mistaken they seemed to prick up their ears not long afterwards i was allowed to depart with the assurance that i might hear further their inquiries into my attainments and references must have given satisfaction in the fulness of time missive arrived to the ef fect that assuming to be competent turkish scholar they would be glad to see again with view to certain vacancy turkish language i had not mentioned to them language of which i never possessed more than ﬁfty words every one of them gotten long years ago how very war ofﬁce i thought these good people were mixing up turkish and russian natural error when one comes to think of it though the respective tongues might not be absolutely identical yet the countries themselves were sufﬁciently close together to account little slip like this was it slip who knows it is so easy to criticise when one is not fully informed about things they may have suggested my acting turkish translator reasons of their own reasons which i can not fathom but which need not therefore be bad ones chagrined like myself are prone to be bitter in an emer gency of this magnitude citizen should hesitate before he ﬁnds fault with the wisdom of those whom the nation has chosen to steer it through troubled waters carping you only hamper the government the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https public should learn to keep civil tongue in its head theirs but to and die none the less it was about this time that i began to experience certain moments of despondency and occasionally let whole day slip by without endeavouring to be of use to the cause moments when instead of asking myself what have i done my country i asked what has my country done moments when i envied the hotel and old women selling ﬂowers in piccadilly circus who had something more sensible to than to bother their heads about trying to be patriotic and getting snubbed their pains yet with characteristic infatuation hopeless ventures i persevered another whack at the f leading to another holograph two more whacks at the censorship interpreter jobs hospital jobs god knows what i persevered and might the next three years have been kicking my heels like any other patriot in the corridor of some dingy government ofﬁce at the mercy of pack of tuppenny counter jumpers but little accident the result of sheer boredom which counselled trip to the sunny mediterranean fortune was nearer to at that supreme moment than she had ever yet been on the day prior to my departure i received communication from the board of trade labour whose methods of work it was now apparent were expeditious its own name was brief that hopeful mr r that bubbling young optimist who had so conscientiously written down number of my qualiﬁcations such they were he was keeping his promise after months and months and months never say die the dear little fellow what job had he captured an of fer to work in factory at gretna green wages to commence at 17s 6d per week h the remuneration was not on princely scale but i like to think that it included the free use of the lavatory if there happened to be one on the premises so luck pursued to the end though it never quite caught up bags were packed and tickets taken and therefore what did you in the great war grandpapa i loafed my boy that was naughty grandpapa naughty but nice alone mentone italiam petimus discovered in local library genuine old maid library full of the trashiest novels those two volumes of sketches by symonds the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https set to comparing the mentone of his day with that of ours what transformation the ef forts of dr james henry bennet and friends aided and abetted by the railway have converted the idyllic ﬁshing village into something dif ferent so vanishes another fair spot from earth and i knew it yet some demon has deposited on these shores where life is spent in round of trivialities one fact sufﬁces symonds driving over from nice at last found himself at the door of the inn the inn are there any inns left at mentone propos of inns here is suggestive state of af fairs at the present moment of the principal hotels and pensions of mentone are closed because owned or controlled or managed by germans does not this speak rather loudly in favour of teuton enterprise where in german town of inhabitants will you ﬁnd such establishments in the hands of frenchmen the statistical mood is upon i wander either among the tombs of that cemetery overhead studying sepulchral inscriptions and drawing deductions from what is therein stated regarding the age nationality and other circumstances of the deceased to the relative number of consumptives here interred sixty per cent shall we say or else in the streets of the town i catch myself endeavouring hitherto without success to count up the number of grocers shops they are far in excess of what is needful now why well your tailor or hatter or hosier he makes certain ﬁxed proﬁt on each article he sells and he does not sell them at every moment of the day the other quite apart from small advantages to be gained owing to the ever prices of his wares is ceaselessly engaged in dispensing triﬂes on each of which he makes small gain the grocery business commends itself warmly to the french genius garnering halfpennies nowhere on earth i fancy will you see butter more meticulously weighed than here buy ton of it and they will replace on their counter fragment of the weight and size of postage stamp rather than let the balance descend on your side and so the days the weeks have passed will one ever again escape from mentone it may well be colder in italy but anything is preferable to this inane riviera existence i am not prone to recommend restaurants or to discommend them the simple reason that if they have proved bad i smile to think of other men being poisoned and robbed well myself to the good ones why only fool would reveal their whereabouts since however i hope so to order my remaining days of life never to be obliged to return to these gimcrack regions there is inducement withholding the name of the merle blanc at monte carlo quite unpretentious place of entertainment that well deserves its name white blackbirds being rather scarcer here than elsewhere the food is excellent it has cachet of its own the wine more than merely good and this is surprising the local mixtures either italian stuf f which is dumped down in shiploads at nice marseille cette or else the poor though sometimes aromatic product of the var are not gratifying to the palate one imbibes them none the less in preference to anything else it is peculiarity of what goes under the name of wine hereabouts that the more you pay it the worse it tastes if you adventure into the olympic spheres of chateau laﬁte and so forth you may put your trust in god or in blue pill chateau cassis would be good name these ﬁner vintages seeing that the harmless black currant enters lar gely into their composition though not in sufﬁcient quantity to render them wholly innocuous which suggests little problem the oenophilist what dif ference of soil or exposure or climate the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https can explain the fact that mentone is utterly deﬁcient in anything drinkable of native origin whereas ventimiglia stone throw eastwards can boast of its san biagio rossese latte dolceacqua and other noble growths the like of which are not to be found along the whole length of the french riviera having pastured the inner man to his complete satisfaction at the hospitable merle blanc our traveller will well to pasture his eyes on the plants in the casino gardens whoever wants to see ﬂowers and trees on their best behaviour must come to monte carlo where the riviera note is at its highest development not leaf is out of place they have evidently been groomed and tubbed and manicured from the hour of their birth and yet is it possible lurking among all this modern splendour of vegetation though ashamed to show their faces may be discerned few lowly olive trees well may they skulk these are the todas and veddahs the aboriginals of monte carlo who peopled its sunny slopes in gotten days of rustic life once lords of the soil now pariahs what are they doing here and how comes it that the eyesore has not yet been detected and uprooted by those authorities that perform such wonders in making the visitor feel at home and hush up with miraculous dexterity everything in the nature of public scandal in exempliﬁcation whereof let tell trivial riviera tale there was an englishwoman here one of those indestructible modern ladies who breakfast off an ether cocktail and half dozen aspirins and feel all the better it and who one day found herself losing rather heavily at the tables another aspirin is going to turn my luck she thought and therewith swallowed surreptitiously her last tabloid of the panacea not unobserved however straightway two elegant gentlemen they might have been russian princes pounced upon her and led her to that under ground where kindly physician is in perennial attendance he brushed aside her explanations it would be thousand pities so charming lady to poison herself but since you wish to take that step why choose the casino which has reputation to keep up are there not hotels i tell you it was only aspirin alas we are sufﬁciently familiar with that tale now madam let us not lose moment it is question of life and death aspirin i tell you kindly submit or the three of us will be obliged to employ force the was produced it is the drawback of all places that half the landscape is unavailable purposes of human locomotion being covered by useless water mentone is more unfortunate than most of them its hinterland is so cloven and contorted that unless you keep on the main roads or content yourself with short but pleasant strolls you will soon ﬁnd all progress barred by some natural obstruction and one really can not walk along the esplanade all day long though it is worth while once in lifetime continuing that promenade far cap martin if only in memory of the inspiration which symonds drew therefrom who he asks who can resist the inﬂuence of greek ideas at the cape martin anybody can nowadays the place is encrusted the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https villas of parvenus wherein we include the empress eugénie to say nothing of that preposterous hotel at the very point which disﬁgures the country leagues around on other occasions you may ﬁnd your way towards evening up to gorbio and stay supper provided you not mind being cheated or wander further aﬁeld over sospel to breil by the old path note the lavender they make passable perfume of it or else to moulinet famous bad food and mastodontic breed of mosquitoes and thence along the stream note the bushes of wild box and over wooded ridge to the breezy heights of peira cava there to dream away the daylight under the pines these are summer rambles at present the snow lies deep one of my favourite excursions has been up the berceau the shaped hill which dominates mentone on the east i was there solitary luncheon resting awhile in the timbered saddle between the peaks the summit is only about ﬁve minutes walk from this delectable grove but its view inland is partially intercepted by higher ridge from here if you are in the mood you may descend eastward over the italian frontier crossing the stream which is spanned lower down by the bridge of louis and ﬁnd yourself at mortola superiore try the wine and then at mortola proper try the wine somewhere in this gulley was killed the last wolf of these regions so local nimrod told he had wrought much mischief in his time that is to say he was not killed but accidentally drowned drowned in one of those artiﬁcial reservoirs which are periodically ﬁlled and drawn of f irrigating the gardens lower down an ignoble death wolf goat lay drowned beside him the event he reckoned must have taken place half century ago since then the wolf has never been seen this afternoon however i preferred to repose in that shady dell while ﬂock of goldcrests were investigating the branches overhead and two buzzards cruised in dreamy spirals about the sunny sky of midday to repose to indulge my genius and review the situation to proﬁt in short by that sense of aloofness peculiar to such aerial spots which tempts the mind to set its house in order what are we doing in these empty regions why not wander hence that cursed traveller gift of sitting still of remaining stationary matter where until one is actually pushed away and yet how enjoyable this land might be were it inhabited by any race save one whose thousand little meannesses public and private are calculated to drain away man last ounce of not many are the glad memories i shall carry from mentone i can think of more than two there is my landlady to begin with who spies out every detail of my daily life of decent birth and richer than croesus but inﬂamed with peevish penuriousness which amount of plain speaking on my part will correct never day passes that she does not permit herself some jocular observation anent my spendthrift habits the following is an example of our matutinal converse i fear monsieur you omitted to put out the light in certain place last night it was burning when i returned home certainly not madame i have been nicely brought up i never visit places at night you ought to be familiar with my habits after all this time true then it must have been some one else ah these electricians bills or the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https monsieur monsieur the english consul called yesterday with his little dog at about ﬁve he waited in your room but you never came back five i was at the baths i have heard of that establishment what they char ge hot bath three francs bon dieu if you take an abonnement otherwise it may well be more and so you go there why then why must you also wash in the morning and splash water on my ﬂoor it may have to be polished after your departure would you mind asking the consul by the way not to sit on the bed it weakens the springs or this might i beg you monsieur to tread more lightly on the carpet in your room i bought it only nine years ago and it already shows signs of wear nine years that old rag it must have survived by miracle i not ask you to avoid using it i only beg you will tread lightly possible carpets are meant to be worn out you would express yourself less forcibly if you had to pay them let us say then carpets are meant to be trodden on lightly i am not fairy madame i wish you were monsieur thrice already in burst of conﬁdence has she told the story of an egg an egg which rankles in the memory some years ago it seems she went to certain shop naming it shop she has avoided ever since to buy an egg and paid the full price yes the full price of fresh egg that particular egg was not fresh so far from fresh was it that she experienced considerable difﬁculty in swallowing it memorable episode occurred about fortnight ago i was greeted towards 8 with moanings in the passage where madame tottered around her entire head swathed in bundle of nondescript woollen wraps out of which there peered one steely vulturesque eye she looked more than ever like an animated fungus her teeth her teeth the pain was past enduring the whole jaw rather all the teeth at one and the same time they were unaccountably loose and felt moreover three inches longer than they ought to feel never had she suf fered such agony never in all her life what could it be it was easy to diagnose periostitis and prescribe tincture of the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https that will cost about franc she observed very likely i think i wait next day the pain was worse instead of better she would give anything to obtain relief anything anything i inquired then you had better have morphia injection i have had numbers of them the same trouble the pain will vanish like magic there is my friend dr théophile fornari i know all about him he demands ﬁve francs visit even from poor people like myself you really can not expect busy practitioner to come here and climb your stairs much less than ﬁve francs i think i wait anyhow i am not wasting money on food just now and that is consolation now periostitis can hardly be called an amusing complaint and i would have purchased franc worth of iodine almost anybody on earth not then on the contrary i grew positively when after three more days the lamentations began to diminish in volume they were sweet music to my ears at the time they are sweeter by far in retrospect if only one could extract the same amount of innocent and durable pleasure out of all other landladies my second joyful memory centres round another thing of beauty spiky agave miscalled aloe of monstrous dimensions which may be seen in the garden of certain hotel many are the growths of this kind which i have admired in various lands none can vaunt proud and harmonious development this one you would say it had been cast in some dull blue metal the glaucous wonder stands by itself prodigy of good style more pleasing to the eye than all that painfully generated tropicality of mr hanbury mortola paradise it is ﬂawless vainly have i teased my fancy endeavouring to discover the slightest defect in shape or hue on the turf in exultant pose with pallid vir ginal bloom upon those mighty writhing leaves this plant has drawn like magnet day after day to drink deep draughts of contentment from its exquisite lines the rest the whole agave family thrives at mentone the ferox is particularly well represented one misses among others that delightful picta variety of which i have noticed only few indif ferent specimens 1 it is the same with the yuccas they ﬂourish here though one kind again is conspicuous by its absence the atkinsi some such name it is long since i planted my last yucca with drooping leaves of you will be surprised at the number of agaves in ﬂower here the reason is that they are liable to be moved about ornamental purposes when they want to be at rest the plant more sensitive and fastidious than it looks is outraged by this forceful perambulation and in an access of premature senility or suicidal mania or sheer despair gives birth to its only ﬂower herald of death the fatal climax could be delayed if gardeners in transplanting would at least take the trouble to set them in their old accustomed exposure so far the cardinal points are concerned but your professional gardener knows everything it is useless an amateur to of fer him advice worse than useless of course to ask him it indeed the ﬂowers even the wild ones might almost reconcile one to life on the riviera almost i recall the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https instance seven feet high at the end of june though now slumbering under ground in the chemin saint jacques there where the steps begin almost and here my afternoon musings up yonder took on more acrid complexion i remembered recent talk with one of the teachers at the local college who lamented that his pupils displayed singular dullness in their essays never in his long career at dif ferent schools had he met with boys more destitute of originality what could be expected we both agreed mentone was of recent growth the old settlement mentone of symonds proclaims its existence only by ceaseless and infernal clanging of bells rivalling malta history character tradition mushroom town inhabited by shopkeepers and hôteliers who are there the sole purpose of plucking foreigners how should youngster imagination be nurtured in this atmosphere of savourless modernism then i asked myself who comes to these regions now that invalids have learnt the drawbacks of their climate decayed muscovites englishmen such you will vainly seek in england and their painted with stony gambling eyes turk or two jews and cosmopolitan sharks and sharpers ﬂamboyant americans brazilian peruvian chilian bolivian rastaqueros with names that read like nightmare see list of arrivals in new y ork herald the whole exotic rif enlivened and perfumed by copious sprinkling of horizontales and i let my glance wander along that ancient roman road which led from italy to arles and can still be traced here and there i

sicilians because they learn good italian at their schools think themselves indistinguishable from other men yes he explained he was from certain place in the catania part of the country on the slopes of etna i happened to know good deal of that place from an old of mine who was born there and never wearied of telling about it to his still greater surprise therefore i proceeded to discourse learnedly about that region extolling its natural beauties and healthy climate reminding him that it was the birthplace of man celebrated in antiquity was it diodorus siculus the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https hinting none too vaguely that he would doubtless live up to the traditions of so celebrated spot straightway his manner changed there is nothing these folks love more than to hear from foreign lips some praise of their native town or village he waxed communicative and even friendly his eyes began to sparkle with animation and there we might have stood conversing till sunrise had i not felt that glacial wind searching my garments chilling my humanity and arresting all generous impulses rather abruptly i bade farewell to the cheery little reptile and snatched up my bags to go to the hotel which he said was only ﬁve minutes walk from there things turned out exactly he had predicted arrived at spezia however i found an unpleasant surprise awaiting the ofﬁcer in command who was civil the majority of such jackasses suggested that one single day would be quite sufﬁcient to see the sights of levanto i could then proceed to pisa or anywhere else outside his priceless zone of defence i pleaded vigorously more time after all we were allies were we not finally sojourn of seven days was granted reasons of health only seven days how tiresome from the paper which gave this authorisation and contained full account of my personal appearance i learnt among other less ﬂattering details that my complexion was held to be natural it was drop of sweetness in the bitter cup butter breakfast the landlord on being summoned avowed that to serve crude butter on his premises involved ﬂagrant breach of war regulations the condiment could not be used save kitchen purposes and then only on certain days of the week he was liable to heavy penalties if it became known that one of his guests however since he assumed to be prudent person he would undertake to supply due allowance and thenceforward though never in the public never never in the that is the charm of italy i said to myself these folks are reasonable and gifted with imagination

overhanging the sea like all places along this shore levanto lies in kind of amphitheatre at spot where one or more streams descending from the mountains dischar ge themselves into the sea many of these watercourses may in former times have been lar ger and even navigable up to point their ﬂow is now obstructed their volume diminished i daresay they have driven the sea further out with silt

in that mellow sunshine made regret more than ever the enforced brevity of my stay at levanto seven days reasons of health only seven days those mysterious glades opening into the the green patches of culture interspersed with cypresses and pines dainty villas nestling in gardens covered mountains and blue sea above all the presence of running water dear to those who have lived in waterless lands why one could spend time in place like this the lieutenant spoke of florence his native city he would be there again before long in order to present himself to the medical authorities and be weighed and pounded the hundredth time he hoped they would then let him stay there he was tired to death of levanto and its solitude how pleasant to bid farewell to this melancholy sea which was supposed to be good his complaints he asked you know why florentines coming home from abroad always rejoice to see that wonderful dome of theirs rising up from the plain why ca you guess let see it is sure to be something not quite proper h the tower of giotto example has certain asperities angularities anfractuosities you are englishman whatever he laughed now try that joke on the next florentine you meet

day of the year how german and then the war came he cleared out the natives were sorry this whole coast seems to be saturated with teutons of respectable class apparently they made themselves popular they bought houses drank wine and joked with the countrymen what you make of them i the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https i am tuscan he began meaning i am above i can view these things with olympic detachment i think the german says to himself we want like those damned english how did they get it by piracy two can play at that game though it may be little more difﬁcult now than formerly of course he added we have certain sprinkling of humanitarians even here the kind of man i mean who stands aside in fervent prayer while his daughter is being ravished by the bulgars and then comes forward with some amateurish attempt at first aid and probably makes mess of it but italians whole well we are lovers of violent and disreputable methods it is our heritage from mediaeval times the only thing that annoys the ordinary native of the country is if his own son happens to get killed i know that makes him very angry it makes him angry not with the germans who are responsible the war but with his own government which is responsible conscripting the boys ah what stupid subject of conversation and how god would laugh if he had any sense of humour suppose we go

celestial hues speaking of these mountains in general way they are bare masses whose coloration trembles between misty blue and mauve according to distance light and hour of day the rock imparts tint

well you see what has happened right up to genoa and down below levanto nothing but pines you italians ought to be grateful to that man the value of the timber which is now being felled along this

you know who planted the trees it was scotsman scozzese what kind of animal is that person who thinks ahead then my mother is scotsman i glanced from the sea into his face there was something of the same calm depth in both the same sunny composure what is it this limpid state of the mind what we call this alloy of profundity and frankness we call it intelligence i would like to meet that man or woman who can make attilio say something foolish he does not know what it is to feel shy serenely objective he discards those subterfuges which are the usual safeguard of youth or inexperience the evasions reservations and prevarications that defend the shallow the weak the his candour rises above them he feels instinctively that these things are pitfalls have you sweetheart attilio certainly i have but it is not man af fair we are only children you understand siamo ancora piccoli did you ever give her kiss never not single one the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https relight my pipe and then inquire why not give her kiss people would call disrespectful boy nobody surely need be any the wiser she is not like you and pause not like us how so she would tell her sister what of it the sister would tell her mother who would say unpleasant things to mine and perhaps to other folks then the fat would be in the ﬁre and that is why another pause what would your mother say to you she would say y are the oldest male you should conduct yourself accordingly what is this lack of judgment i hear about i begin to understand siena driven from the paradise of levanto i landed not on earth but with one jump in hell the turks ﬁgure forth hell of ice and snow this is my present abode its name is siena every one knows that this town lies on hill on three hills the inference that it would be cold in january was fairly obvious how cold nobody could have guessed the sun is invisible streets are deep in snow icicles hang from the windows worst of all the hotels are unheated those english you know they refuse to supply us with coal could this be the city where i was once nearly roasted to death it is an ef fort to recall that glistening month of the palio

patriotism that he actually went on to say unfriendly things about the tower who ever thought of building tower at the bottom of hill it was good enough he dared say siena oh yes doubtless it satisﬁed

his return from italy in 1828 from very full notes made from day to day during my journey 1828 that date is important it was in 1828 therefore when the events occurred which he relates and he allowed an interval of forty years to elapse ere making them public the umbrella on the other hand is always cropping up it pervades the volume like leitmotif it is most invaluable article protecting the head against the sun rays so constantly is it used that after single month wear we ﬁnd it already in sad state of dilapidation still he clings to it defence against brigands it might prove useful and on one occasion indeed he seizes it in his hand prepared to show ﬁght this happened be it remembered in vainly one conjectures what the mountain folk of south italy thought of such phenomenon even now if they saw you carrying an umbrella about in the sunshine they would cross themselves and perhaps pray your recovery perhaps not yet ramage was not mad at all he was only more individualistic and centrifugal than many people having formed by bitter experience sensible theory to wit that sunstroke is unpleasant and can be avoided by the use of an umbrella he is not above putting it into

and note the predominance of the colour the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https his attire it was popular at that period with english travellers such men however were unknown in most of the regions which ramage explored the colour must have inspired feelings akin to awe in the minds of the natives white is their bête noir they have rooted aversion to it and never employ it in their clothing because it suggests to their fancy the idea of bloodlessness of anaemia and death if you want to make one of them ill over his dinner wear white waistcoat accordingly it is not surprising that he sometimes ﬁnds himself an object of curiosity an english at one place was quite alarmed at my appearance elsewhere he meets band of who took fright at my appearance and scampered of

careful to apprise us of this detail and soaked moreover from head to foot after an immersion in the river tara he entered the public square which was full of inhabitants and soon found himself the centre of lar ge crowd looking he says like drowned rat his appearance caused great amazement what is the matter who is he they asked the muleteer explained that he was an englishman and that

rossano actually blocked by them sleeping in stables and execrable inns viewing sites of antiquity and natural beauty interrogating everybody about everything and in general satisfying his curiosity that curiosity took great deal to satisfy it is positive relief to come upon sentence in this book sentence unique which betrays relaxing or waning of this terrible curiosity it requires strong mania antiquities to persevere examining such remains alife furnishes and i was soon satisﬁed with what i had seen nor did he climb to the summit of mount vulture he would have done if the view had not been obscured by haze his chief concern could not be better summed up than in the he has chosen this volume wanderings in sear ch of ancient r emains and modern superstitions to any one who knows the country it appears astonishing how much he contrived to see and in how brief space of time he accomplished wonders it was mean task he had proposed to himself namely to visit every spot in italy which classic writers had rendered famous to visit every spot what gar gantuan undertaking none but quite young man could have conceived such project and even ramage with all his good health and zest might have spent half lifetime over the business but his habit of breathless hustle which leaves the reader panting behind he is always on the move he reminds one of mr phineas fogg in that old tale the moment he has satisﬁed his curiosity there is holding him of f he goes the smiles of the girls whom he adores the entreaties of some gentle scholar who fain would keep him guest the night they are

paragraph of the book he is hurrying because time is fast running out this sense of fateful hustle this and the umbrella they impart quite peculiar ﬂavour to his pages one would like to learn more about so lovable type such he was unquestionably one would like to know above all things why his descriptions of other parts of italy have never been printed was the enterprise interrupted by his death he tells us that the diaries of his tours through the central and northern regions were written that he visited every celebrated spot in umbria and etruria and wandered far the valley of the po where are these notes those on etruria especially would make good reading at this distance of time when even dennis has acquired an aroma the dictionary of national biography might tell us something about him but that handy little volume is not here moreover it has knack of telling you everything about people save what you ought to know so example i had occasion not long ago to look up the account of charles waterton the naturalist 3 he did good work in his line but nothing is more peculiar to the man than his waywardness it was impossible him to anything after the manner of other folks in all his words and actions he was freak curiosity the prince of eccentrics yet this the essence of the man the fundamental trait of his character which shines out of every page of his writing and every detail of his daily life this the feature by which he was known to his fellows and ought to be known to posterity it is intelligible from that account only if you read between the lines is that the way to write biography fortunately he has written himself down so has ramage and it is instructive to compare the wayside reﬂections of these two contemporaries they rove about the ruins of italy the ﬁrst ardent catholic his horizon by what the good fathers of stonyhurst had seen ﬁt to teach him the other less complacent all alive indeed with calvinistic disputatiousness and ready to embark upon bold speculations anent the origin of heathen gods and their modern representatives in the church of rome amiable scholars and gentlemen both of them yet neither venturing to draw those plain

some kind in the hour of evening under wintry sky amid whose darkly massed vapours young moon is peering down upon this maddened world i wander alone through deserted roadways towards that old solitary here i stand and watch the arno rolling its sullen waves in pisa at such an hour the arno is the emblem of despair swollen with melted snow from the mountains it has gnawed its miserable clay banks and now creeps along leaden and inert half solid like torrent of liquid mud irresolute whether to be earth or water whether to stagnate here ever at my feet or crawl onward yet another sluggish league into the sea so may lethe look or styx the nightmare of ﬂood there is dreary monotony in all italian rivers once they have reached the plain they are livelier in their upper reaches at florence where those houses are mirrored in the stream you may study the arno in all its ever moods seldom is its colour quite the same the hue of in full spate it shifts at other times between and jade between celadon and chrysolite and in the weariness of summer the tints are prone to fade altogether out of the waves they grow bleached devitalized they are spent withering away like grass that has lain in the sun 4 yet with every thunder on yonder hills the colour leaps back into the waters your florentine of the humbler sort loves to dawdle along the bank on bright afternoon watching the play of the river and drawing kind of philosophic contentment out of its cool aquatic humours presently he reaches that jewellers bridge he thinks he must buy ring be sure the stone will reﬂect his arno in one of its moods i will wager he selects translucent chrysoprase set in silver cheap and stubborn gem whose frigidly uncompromising hue appeals in mysterious fashion to his own temperament whoever suf

upon the subject of heredity subject that had certain fascination in my biological days the lacunae of science we weigh the distant stars and count up their ingredients yet here is phenomenon which lies under our very hand and to which is devoted the most passionate study what have we learnt of its laws be that it may there occurred to last night new idea it consisted in putting together two facts which have struck separately on many occasions but never conjointly taken together i said to myself and granted that both are correct they may help to elucidate dark problem of national psychology the ﬁrst one i state rather tentatively having hardly sufﬁcient material to go upon it is this you will ﬁnd it mor common in italy than in england the male offspring of family to r esemble the father and the female the mother i can not suggest reason this i have observed the fact that is all let say in parenthesis that it is well to conﬁne oneself to adults in such researches childhood and youth is period of changing lights and and temperamental interplay characteristics of body and mind are held it were in solution we think child takes after its mother because of this or that feature if we wait years we see the true state of af fairs the hair has grown dark like the father the nose the most telling item of the face has also approximated to his type likewise the character in fact the offspring is clearly built on paternal lines and to study children these purposes would be waste of time the second observation i regard axiomatic it is this you will nowher ﬁnd an adult offspring which r eproduces in any marked degr ee the physical featur es of one par ent displaying in any marked degr ee the mental featur es of the other that man whose external build and complexion is entirely modelled upon that of his hard materialistic father and who yet possesses all the artistic idealism of his maternal parent such creatures not exist in nature though you may encounter them often you please in the pages of novelists let insert another parenthesis to observe that i am speaking of the broad mass the average in general way it stands to reason that the of fspring may be vaguely intermediate between two parents may resemble one or both in certain particulars and not in others may hark back to ancestral types or bear appreciable likeness to any one discoverable it is theme admitting of endless combinations and permutations or again in reference to the ﬁrst proposition it would be easy any traveller in this country to point out example woman who portrays the qualities of her father in the clearest manner i know dozen such cases hundreds of them would not make them otherwise than what i think they are rarer here than in england granting that both these propositions are correct what should we expect to ﬁnd that in italy the male type of character and temperament is more constant more intimately associated with the male type of feature and the same with the female in other words that the categories into which their men and women fall are fewer and more clearly deﬁned by reason of the fact that their mental and moral are more closely correlated with their physical that the englishman on the other hand male or female does not fall so easily into categories he is complex and difﬁcult to place the psychological being more hazily demarcated there is iridescence and ambiguity here whereas italians of either sex once the rainbow period of youth is over are relatively unambiguous easily placed the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman

quite calmly though referring to the weather would you mind telling that abortion that if he goes on making such face i shall have to shoot him tell him will you there good fellow and i had to humour

the very gate of rome and ﬁll it with the scum of trastevere the difference would still be there it might be more noisy than mar gate it would certainly be less blatant myself i hate viareggio at all seasons and nothing would have brought here but the prospect of visiting the neighbouring carrara mines with attilio to whom i have written enclosing postcard reply this is modern town built on plain

something of an aroma if you stroll about the canal and harbour where sails are now ﬂapping furiously in the north wind you may look up to the peaks and imagine yourself in switzerland and then thank god you are not there of italy i perceive little or nothing the people are birds of prey shallow and rapacious brood who ﬂeece visitors during those summer weeks and live on the proceeds the rest of the year there is commerce to liven them up and make them smilingly polite historical tradition to give them agriculture worth mentioning the soil is too poor in other words peasantry to replenish the gaps in city life and infuse an element of decency and depth an inordinate amount of singing and whistling goes on all day long is it not sign of i would like the opinion of schoolmasters on this

there in day or two wo she really you are chattering much too much queen va bene va bene va bene sad little incident under the pines fortnight has elapsed i refuse to budge from viareggio having discovered the village of corsanico on the heights yonder and in that village family altogether to my liking how one stumbles upon delightful folks set down in furthest cathay and i will undertake to ﬁnd soon afterwards some person with whom i am quite prepared to spend the remaining years of life the to corsanico is never af fair deep in mire it meanders perversely about the plain meanders more than ever but of necessity once the foot of the hills is reached i soon gave it up in favour the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https to cammaiore which deposits you at station whose name i forget whence you may ascend to corsanico through village called i think momio that route also was promptly abandoned when the path along the canal was revealed to this waterway runs in an almost straight line from viareggio to the base of that particular hill on whose summit lies my village it is monotonous walk at this season the rich marsh vegetation slumbers in the ooze under ground waiting breath of summer at last you cross that big road and strike the limestone rock here is intermediate region undulating ground between the upland and the plain they conver ge abruptly upon each other might have been expected seeing that these hills used to be the old and this green level in olden days the mediterranean three dif ferent tracks leading steeply upward through olives and pines and chestnuts from where the canal ends will bring you to corsanico i know them all i could ﬁnd my way in darkest midnight days have passed days of delight i climb up in the morning and descend at nightfall my mind well stored with recollections of pleasant talk and smiling faces large place this corsanico straggling about the with scattered farms and gardens to reach the tobacconist near whose house by the way you obtain an unexpected glimpse into the valley of cammaiore is something of an excursion rule we repose after luncheon on certain wooded knoll we are high up seven or eight hundred feet above the canal the blue tyrrhenian is dotted with steamers and sailing boats and yonder lies viareggio in its belt of forest far away to the left you discern the tower of pisa placid lake between the two is now famous being the spot selected by the great maestro puccini to spend summer month in seclusion i am learning the name of every locality in the plain of every peak among the mountains at our back and that little ridge of stone says my companion you see it jutting into the ﬁelds down there it has queer name we call it la sirena la sirena it is good to live in land where such memories cling to old rocks by what chance has the name survived to haunt this inland crag defying geological changes outlasting the generations of men their creeds and tongues and races how it takes one back back into hoary antiquity into another landscape altogether one thinks of those greek mariners coasting past this promontory and pouring libations to the siren into an ocean on whose untrampled ﬂoor the countryman now sows his rice and turnips paganisme immortel mort on le dit pan tout bas moque et la sirène en rit they are still here both sea and siren they have

corsanico more charming all drenched in sunlight and pranked out with fresh green on this fourteenth of may i said to myself i am wont to attend certain yearly festival far away and there enjoy myself prodigiously yet can it be possible i am even happier here seldom does the event surpass one hopes later than usual long after sunset under olives already through patches of corn and beans across the little brook past that familiar and solitary farmhouse i descended to the canal in full content another golden moment of life strong exhalations rose up from the swampy soil that teemed and steamed under the hot breath of spring the water once so bare was smothered under riot of monstrous and loud with the music of frogs stars were reﬂected on its surface my star would i were heaven to gaze on thee with many eyes such was my mood hellenic mood mood summed up in that one word greek tetelestai not to be taken however in the sense of all over quite the reverse did shelley ever walk in like humour along this canal i doubt it he lacked the master an evangelist of kind he was streaked all his paganism with the craze of one day he escaped from his chains into those mountains and there beheld certain witch only to be called back to mortality by domestic and lady he tried to translate the symposium he never tried to live it i have now interposed day of rest my welcome in the villa situated in the street called after certain politician was that of the prodigal son there was look bordering on af fection in the landlady eyes she knew i would come back once the weather was warmer she would now give cool room instead of that old one facing south those cement ﬂoors they were not so inconvenient were they at this season the honey breakfast assuredly the very same and there was tailor she had discovered in the interval cheaper and better than that other one if anything required attention and thus having lived long at the mercy of london landladies and london charwomen having suf fered the torments of hell more years than i care to remember at the hands of these pickpockets and hags and harpies and drunken sluts i am now rewarded by the services of something at the other end of the human scale impossible to say too much of this good dame solicitude her main object in life seems to be to save my money and make comfortable get your shoes soled there she told two days ago that man is from viareggio i know better place let see to it i will say they are my husband and you will pay less and get better work with kind of motherly instinct she forestalls my every wish and at the end of few days had already known my habits better than one of those london sharks and furies would have known them at the end of century my thoughts go back to her of florence whom i have just left equally efﬁcient she represented quite dif ferent type she was not of the familiar kind but rather grave and formal with spectacles dyed hair and an upright carriage she never mothered she conversed and gave the impression of being in the presence of grande dame such i used to say to myself while listening to her periods enlivened with steely glints of humour such were the feelings of those who conversed with madame the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https such and not otherwise it would be difﬁcult to conceive her saying anything equivocal or vulgar yet she must have been naughty little girl not long ago she never dreams that i know what i know that she is mistress of high police functionary and greatly in favour with his set most useful landlady in short virtuous young bachelor like myself on learning this fact i made it my business to study her weaknesses and soon discovered that she was fond of particular brand of chianti ﬂask of this vintage was promptly secured then dissatisﬁed with its materialistic aspect i caused it to be garlanded with wreath of violets and despatched it to her private apartment by the prettiest child i could pick up in the street that is the way to touch their hearts the of fering was repeated at convenient intervals little item in the newspaper led to some talk one morning about the war i found she shared the view common to many others that this is an interested war society has or ganized itself on new lines lines which work against peace there are so many persons interested in keeping up the present state of affairs people who now make more money than they ever made before everybody has ﬁnger in the pie the soldier in the ﬁeld the chief person concerned is voiceless and of account when compared with this army of civilians every one of whom would lose if the war came to an end they will ﬁght like demons to keep the fun going what else should they their income is at stake man heart is in his purse i asked supposing madame you desired to end the war how would you set about it whereupon delightfully tuscan idea occurred to her i think i would abolish this nonsense it makes things too pleasant it would bring the troops to their senses and cause them to march home and say basta we have had enough you ﬁnd the germans little prepotenti prepotenti yes by all means let us break their heads and then caro lei let us learn to imitate them that afternoon i remember being wondrously ﬁne and myself in such mellow mood that i would have shared my last crust with some shipwrecked archduchess and almost given mine enemies though not until i had hit them back i strolled about the cascine they have done something to make this place attractive just then at all events the shortcomings were unobserved amid the burst of green things overhead and underfoot originally it must have been an unpromising stretch of land running it does in dead level along the arno yet there is earth and water and good deal can be done with such materials to diversify the surface more might have been accomplished here in the matter of hill and dale and lake and variety of vegetation the cascine are not remarkable one calls to mind what has been attained at kew gardens in an identical situation and with far less sunshine the landscape gardener to play with one thinks of certain town in germany where on plain ﬂat billiard table they actually reared mountain now covered with houses and timber the disport of the citizens to think that i used to skate over the meadows where that mountain now stands there was in the cascine that afternoon nothing but the usual football the pastime is well worth glance if only the sake of sympathizing with the poor referee several hundred opprobrious epithets the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https at his head in the course of single game and play is often suspended while somebody or other hotly disputes his decision and refuses to be guided any longer by his perverse interpretation of the rules and whoever wishes to know whence those plastic artists of old florence drew their inspiration need only come here figures of consummate grace and strength and clothed moreover in costume which leaves little to the imagination those shorts fully deserve their name they are shortness itself and their brevity is only equalled by their tightness one wonders how they can squeeze themselves into such an outﬁt or that feat accomplished play in it with any sense of comfort play they and furiously despite the heat watching the game and mindful of that morning discourse with madame maintenon sudden wave of feeling swept over i grew strangely warlike and began to snort with indignation what were all these young fellows doing here big chaps of eighteen and twenty half of them ought to be in the trenches damn it instead of fooling about with ball it would have been instructive to learn the true ideas of the rising generation in regard to the political outlook to single out one of the younger spectators and make him talk but these better lads cluster together at the approach of stranger and one does not want to start public discussion with half dozen of them my chance came from another direction it was and certain player limped out of the ﬁeld and sat down on the grass i was beside him before his friends had time to come up superb specimen all dewy with perspiration any damage nothing much he gasped man on the other side had just caught him with the full swing of his ﬁst under the ribs it hurt confoundedly hardly fair play i commented it was cleverly done ah well i said warming to my english character you may get harder knocks in the trenches i suppose you are nearly due not year or so he replied and even then of course he was quite eligible to physique it was really rather awkward but to serving in the army there were other jobs going was anything more precious than life could anything replace his life to him to die at his age it would certainly be pity from an artistic point of view but if everybody thought like that where would the isonzo line be if everybody thought he did there would be isonzo line at all german inﬂuence in italy why not they had been there before it was dark page in italian history was his own government so admirable that one should regret its disappearance pack of knaves and cutthroats patriotism phrase they say one thing and mean another the english too yes the english too purely mercenary motives all their noble talk it is always entertaining to see ourselves others see us i had the presence of mind to interject some remark which produced the desired ef fect now they howl about the suf ferings of belgium because their are threatened they ﬁght poor belgium they did not ﬁght france the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https or denmark or poland or armenia trade was not threatened there was proﬁt in view proﬁt and they wo even supply us with coal always that coal it is clear daylight england has failed in her duty her duty being to supply everybody with coal ships money cannons and anything else at the purchaser valuation he made few more statements of this nature and i think he enjoyed his little ﬂing at that him relatively speaking since the war began rara avis genuine englishman t eutonic construction i certainly relished it then i asked where did you learn this about armenia i mean and poland from my father he was university professor and deputy in parliament one also picks up little something at school you agree with not altogether you seem to get that nation can not indulge in those freaks of humanitarianism which may possibly beﬁt an individual certain heroic dreamer told men to give all they had to the poor you if you like may adopt this idealistic attitude you may generous actions such your country can not af ford to since nation which abandons the line of expediency is on the high road to suicide if i have bilious attack by all means come and console if poland has bilious attack there is reason why england should step in there may be every reason indeed why england should stand aloof now in belgium you say money is involved money in this national sense means and in this national sense is one of the few things worth ﬁghting however i am only throwing out one or two suggestions on some other day i would like to discuss the matter with you point by point some other day that is when you are not playing football and have just few clothes on i am now at disadvantage you could never get to impugn your statements courageously not in that costume it would be like haggling with apollo belvedere why you wear those baby things we are all wearing them this season so i perceive how you get into them very slowly are they elastic i wish they four minutes talk it gave an insight he was an intellectualist such he admired brute force but refused to employ it he was civilized like many products of civilization he was unaware of its blessings and unconcerned in its fate is it not feature peculiar to civilization that it thinks of everything save war that is why they are uprooted these ﬂowerings each in its turn my father told often one hears that remark even from adults if father could not be fool like anybody else that child should have opinions it is engaging children are egocentric fellow of this size ought to be less the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https reﬁned youths are fastidious about their clothes they would not dream of buying suit however they are content to take their opinions unlike ours they are seldom alone they lack those stretches of solitude during which they might wrestle with themselves and little thinking on their own account when not with their family they are always among companions being far more sociable and fond of herding together than their english representatives they talk more they think less they seem to each other thinking which takes away all hesitation and gives them precocious air of maturity if this decorative lad engages in some profession like medicine or engineering there is hope him even others of his age rectify their perspective by contact with crude facts groceries and calicoes and carburettors and so forth otherwise his doom is sealed he remains doctrinaire this country is full of them and then the sterilizing inﬂuence of pavements even when summer comes round they all ﬂock in mass to some rowdy place like this viareggio or ancona where however pleasant the bathing spiritual life is yet shallower than at home what says craufurd tait ramage their country life consists merely in breathing dif ferent air though in nothing else does it differ from the life they live in town he notices things does ramage and might indeed have elaborated this argument the average italian townsman seems to have lost all sense the beauty of rural existence he is incurious about it dislodge him from the pavement easy task and he gasps like ﬁsh out of water squares and cafés they stimulate his fancy the doings and opinions of thence alone he derives inspiration what is the result considerable surface polish but also another quality which i should call dewlessness often glittering like diamond he is every bit dewless his materialistic and supercilious outlook results i think from contempt or nescience of nature you will notice the trait still more at venice whose inhabitants seldom forsake their congested depth of character and ideality and humour such things require rustic landscape their nurture these citizens are arid lack of dew unquestionably more so than their english representatives postscript the pavements of florence by the way have an objectionable quality their stone is too soft they wear down rapidly and an army of masons is employed in levelling them straight again all the year round and yet they sometimes use this very sandstone instead of marble mural inscriptions how long are these expected to remain legible they employ the same material their buildings and i observe that the older monuments last on the whole better than the new ones which ﬂake away rapidly exfoliate or crack according to the direction from which the grain of the rock has been attacked by the chisel it may well be that florentines of past centuries left the hewn blocks in their shady caverns certain length of time the parisians of in order to allow the slow dischar ge and evaporation of liquid whereas now the material saturated with moisture is torn from its damp and cool quarries and set in the blazing sunshine at the bourse instance quite modern structure the columns already begin to show ﬁssures 7 amply content with viareggio because the siren dwells so near i stroll forth the town is awake hotels are open bathing is beginning summer has dawned upon the land i am not in the city mood three months in florence having abated my interest in humanity past line of booths and pensions i wander in the direction the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https pinery which year by year is creeping further into the waves and driving the sea back from its old shore there is peace in this green domain all is hushed and yet pervaded by the mysterious melody of things that stir in time here are sombre patches under oak or beech only tremulous interlacing of light and shade peculiarly attractive bole not far from the sea gleaming rosy in the sunshine tempts to recline at its foot this insomnia this ﬁend of the darkness the only way to counteract his mischief is by guile by snatching brief oblivion in the hours of day when the demon is far aﬁeld tormenting pious aethiopians at the antipodes how well one rests at such moments of night mer ged into the warm earth the extreme quietude of my present room after florentine noises may have contributed to this restlessness also perhaps the excitement of corsanico but chieﬂy the dream that recurrent dream everybody i suppose is subject to recurrent dreams of some kind my present one is of painful or at least sad nature it returns approximately every three months and never varies by hair breadth i am in distant town where i lived many years back and where each stone is familiar to i have come to look friend one who matter of fact died long ago my sleeping self refuses to admit this fact once embarked on the i hold him to be still alive glad at the prospect of meeting my friend again i traverse cheerfully those squares in the direction of his home where is it that house where has it gone i can not ﬁnd it ages seem to pass while i trample up and down in ever harassment of mind along interminable rows of buildings and canals that door that door vanished all search is vain i shall never meet him him whom i came so far to see the dismal truth once established ﬁlls with an intensity of suffering such only can inspire there is reason feeling so strongly it is the way of dreams at this point i wake up thoroughly exhausted and say to myself why seek his house is he not dead this stupid nightmare leaves unrefreshed next morning and often bears in its rear trail of wistfulness which may endure week only within the last few years has it dared to invade my slumbers before that period there was series of other recurrent dreams what will the next be i mean to oust this particular incubus the monster annoys and even our mulish consciousness can be taught to acquiesce in fact after sufﬁcient lapse of time there are dreams peculiar to every age of man that celebrated one of ﬂying instance it fades away with manhood i once indulged in correspondence about it with psychologist 8 and would like to think even now that this dream is reminiscence of leaping habits in our days ghost of the dim past therefore which revisits us at night when recent adjustments are cast aside and man takes on the credulity and savagery of his remotest forefathers ghost which comes in youth when these ancient etchings are easier to decypher being not yet overscored by fresh personal experiences what is human life but never palimpsest so i pondered when my musings under that pine tree were interrupted by the arrival on the scene of young snake i can not say with any degree of truthfulness which of us two was more surprised at the encounter i picked him up i always when they give chance and began to make myself agreeable to him he had those pretty juvenile markings which disappear with maturity snakes of this kind when they become are nearly always of uniform shade generally black and when they are very the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https old they begin to grow ears and seek out solitary places what is the origin of this belief i have come across it all over the country if you wish to go to any remote or inaccessible spot be sure some peasant will say ah there you ﬁnd the serpent with ears these snakes are not easy to catch with the hand living they among stones and brushwood and gliding of f rapidly once their suspicions are aroused this one i should say was bent on some youthful voyage of discovery or amorous exploit he walked into the trap from inexperience rule your best chance securing them is when they bask on the top of some bush or hedge in relative unconcern knowing they are hard to detect in such places they climb into these aerial situations after the lizards which go there after the insects which go there after the ﬂowers which go there after the sunshine struggling upwards through the thick under growth you must have quick eye and ready hand to grasp them by the tail ere they have time to lash themselves round some stem where once anchored they will allow themselves to be pulled in pieces rather than yield to your ef forts if you fail to seize them they trickle earthward through the tangle like thread of running water he belonged to that common italian kind which has english name germans call them zornnatter in allusion to their choleric disposition most of them are quite ready to snap at the least provocation maybe they ﬁnd it pays it does with other folks to assume the of fensive and be ﬁrst in the ﬁeld demanding your place in the sun with an air of wrathful determination some of the big fellows can draw blood with their teeth yet the jawbones are weak and one can force them asunder without much difﬁculty whereas the bite of emerald lizard instance will provide quite novel sensation the mouth closes on you like steel trap tightly compressing the ﬂesh and often refusing to relax its hold in such cases try puf f of tobacco it works two puf fs will daze them fragment of cigar laid in the mouth stretches them out dead and this is the beast which they say will gulp down prussic acid if it were treacle but snakes vary in temperament we and some of these zamenis serpents are gentle and amiable their cousin the aesculap snake my friend of this afternoon could not be induced to bite perhaps he was naturally mild perhaps drowsy from his winter sleep or ignorant of the ways of the world perhaps he had not yet shed his milk teeth i am disposed to think that he got about biting because i made favourable impression on him from the ﬁrst he crawled up my arm it was pleasantly warm but little too dark soon he emer ged again and glanced around relieved to discover that the world was still in its old place he was not clever at learning tricks i tried to make him stand on his head but he refused to stif fen out snakes have not much sense of humour lizards are far more companionable during two consecutive summers i had close friendship with who spent in my society certain of his leisure moments which were not many he always had an astonishing number of other things on hand he was male bejewelled with blue spots ﬁerce ﬁghter was alfonso such was his name and conspicuous most impressive manner of stamping his front foot when impatient concerning his other virtues i know little i learnt details of his private life save what i saw with my eyes and they were not always worthy of imitation he was polygamist or worse obsessed moreover by deplorable habit of biting of f the tails of his own or other people children he went even further sometimes without word of warning he would pounce upon some innocent youngster and carry him in his powerful jaws the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https over the wall right out of my sight what happened yonder i can not guess it was probably little cannibalism though my meals in those days were all out of doors his attendance at dinner was rather uncertain i suspect he retired early in order to spend the night like other polygamists in prayer and fasting at the hours of breakfast and luncheon he knew them well i did he was generally free and then quite monopolized my company climbing up my leg on to the table eating out of my hand sipping sugar out of his own private bowl and in fact doing everything i suggested i did not suggest impossibilities friendship should never be strained to had i cared to risk such calamity i might have taught him to play skittles the rest it is not very amusing to be either lizard or snake in italy lizards are caught in nooses and then tied by one leg and made to run on the remaining three or secured by cord round the neck and swung about in the air mighty good sport this or deprived of their tails and given to the baby or cat to play with or dragged along at the end of string like reluctant pig that is led to market there are quite number of ways of making lizards feel at home with snakes the procedure is simple they are killed treated to that system to which they used to treat us in our arboreal days when the glassy eye of the serpent gleaming through the branches will have caused our fur to stand on end with horror beast provokes human hatred like that old coiling serpent long and cruel must have been his reign the memory to have lingered how many years let us say in order to be on the safe side million here then is another ghost of the past daylight ghost and look around you the world is full of them we live amid legion of ancestral terrors which creep from their limbo and peer in upon our weaker moments ready to make us their prey man whose wits are not ﬁrmly rooted in earth in warm friends and warm food might well live life of ceaseless trepidation many they brood over their immortal soul ghost others there are whose dreams have altogether devoured their realities these live the most part in asylums there ﬂits along this very shore ghost of another kind that of shelley maybe the spot where they burnt his body can still be pointed out i have forgotten all i ever read on that subject an italian enthusiast the librarian of the laurentian library in florence garnered certain information from ancient ﬁshermen of viareggio in regard to this occurrence and set it down in little book book with white covers which i possessed during my shelley period they have erected memorial to the english poet in one of the public squares here the features of the bust not strike remarkably etherial but the inscription is good specimen of italian adapted to lapidary uses it avoids those insipid verbal terminations which weaken the language and sometimes render it almost ridiculous

of hers with its pink villages nestling among drowsy elms and cornﬁelds i know their spread eagles and angels and white horses and other taverns suggestive sure sign of antiquity of zoological gardens

give lavenham or melford or some place of that kind while looking one day at the house where she was born i was sorely tempted to crave permission to view the interior but refrained something of her own dislike of prying and meddlesomeness came over thence down to that commemorative fountain among the drooping trees the good animals whose comfort it was built would have had some difﬁculty in slaking their thirst just then its basin being chocked up with decayed leaves we corresponded good while and i still possess her letters somewhere i see in memory that lar ge and bold handwriting often only two words to line on the paper the sums she spent on writing materials it was one of her many ladylike traits i tried to induce her to stay with in south italy she made three conditions to be allowed to bring her dogs to have hot bath every day and two litres of cream everything could be managed except the cream which was unprocurable later on while living in the tyrolese mountains i renewed the invitation that third condition could now be fulﬁlled easily the other two she was unwell she replied and could not move out of the house having been poisoned by cook so we never met though she wrote much about herself and about helianthus which was printed after her death in return i dedicated to her book of short stories they were published thank god under pseudonym and eight

that overlooks the coliseum on whose comely ellipse and history she loved to pasture eyes and imagination often i walked thence with her in those sparkling mornings up the palatine hill to stroll about the ilexes and roses in view of the forum to listen to the blackbirds or the siskins in that pine tree she was of the same type the same ethical parentage the late mathilde blind woman of benignant and reﬁned enthusiasm full of charity to the poor and in those later days almost shadowy remote from earth she had saturated herself with rome whose name she professed tremulous af fection untainted by worldly considerations such mine she loved its persistent spiritual life it was her haven of rest so while her arm rested lightly on mine we wandered about those gardens the saintly lady and myself her mind dwelling maybe on memories of that one classic and the part she came nigh to playing in the history of europe while mine was lost in maze of vulgar several of which came nigh to making play part in the of rome what may have helped to cement our strange friendship was my acquaintance at that time with the german metaphysicians she must have thought queer kind of englishman to

seemed to vitiate his whole outlook indeed it does now i know the reason like all preacher he is anthropocentric to his way of thinking the human mind is so highly organized so dif ferent from that of beasts that not all the proofs of ethnology and physiology would ever induce him to accept the of man this is too irksome and humiliating to be true he waives it aside with sneer at the disgusting ar

make one blush philosophy the day may dawn when this man will be read not what he says but how he says it he being one of the few of his race who can write in their own language impossible of course not to hit upon good thing now and then if you brood much he did so i remember one passage wherein he adumbrates the theory of recognition marks propounded later by wallace who when i drew his attention to it wrote that he thought it most interesting anticipation 10 he must have stumbled upon it by accident during one of his excursions into the inane and what of that jovial personage who

was more than varnish it was veneer patina an enamel weather stuf he could talk most plausibly art music society gossip everything you please everything except scandal bitter word was known to pass his lips he sympathized with all our little weaknesses he was too blissfully contented to think ill of others he took it granted that everybody like himself found the world good place to inhabit that

harmful projects think of the mischief that is done in politics alone by the money of these women think of all the religious fads that spring up and are kept going in state of prosperity because some woman or other has not been instructed to the proper use of her i foresee positive decline ahead of us if this state of af fairs is allowed to go on we must club together we reasonable men and put an end to the scandal these women need trimmers an army of trimmers i have done good deal of trimming in my day of course it involves some trouble and close degree of intimacy now and then but sensible man will always know where to draw the line where you draw it at marriage whether he ever dared to tap the venerable malwida loan likely enough he often played with her feelings in delicate style and

therewith purchasing the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https before her eyes all these sums he took his due by right of conquest whether he ever stung malwida i should have liked

quite worthy objects there is poor family i would like to take you to see one day the father was cut to pieces in some wretched agricultural machine the mother is dying in hospital consumption and the six little children all shivering under one blanket well never mind one does what one can in small way that was an interesting lecture was it on friday he made ﬁne point in what he said about the relation of the ego to the cosmos all the same i thought he was little hard on fichte but then you know i always felt sort of tenderness fichte and did you notice that the room was absolutely packed i doubt whether that would have been the case in any other european capital this must be the secret charm of rome you think so this is what draws one to the eternal city and keeps one here and makes one love the place in spite of few trivial annoyances this sense of persistent spiritual life the various sums derived from ladies were regarded merely adventitious income i found out towards the end of our acquaintance when i really began to understand his method that he had second source of revenue far smaller but luckily ﬁxed it was drawn from the other sex from that endless procession of men passing through rome and intent upon its antiquities rome he explained was the very place him this is what keeps here and makes love the place in spite of few trivial annoyances this persistent coming

so grateful having things explained to them another lot next year and there are really good fellows among them fellows mind you with brains fellows with money from each of those twenty he can borrow say ten pounds what is that to rich stranger who comes here month or so with the express purpose of getting rid of his money of course i am only talking about the medium rich one need never apply to

period and this what has become of him you might well ask about his contemporary the piccadilly goat i have idea what became of the piccadilly goat though i know pretty well what would become of him

windows and many others in rome gunpowder magazine had blown up somewhere in the campagna the concussion of air was so mighty that it broke glass they said even at frascati we drove out later to view the site it resembled miniature volcano there i left the party and wandered alone into one of those tortuous beds that intersect the plain searching certain kind of crystal which may be found in such places washed out of the soil by wintry torrents i specialized in minerals in those days minerals and girls dangerous and unproﬁtable studies even at that tender age i seem to have dimly discerned what i now know certain that dangerous and unproﬁtable objects are alone worth pursuing the taste minerals died out later though i clung to it long while dr professor knop and others fanning the dying embers one day all of sudden it was gone i found myself riding somewhere in asiatic turkey past precipice streaked in alternate veins of purest red and yellow jasper with chalcedony in between

her companion she pointed to these things ist doch sonderbar wie wasser so die pﬂanzen versteinert she thought they were natural plants petriﬁed by the water action what happened yesterday was equally surprising we were sitting at the arch of constantine and i was telling my friend about the coliseum hard by and how not long ago it was thicket of trees and ﬂowers looking less like ruin than some wooded mountain now the coliseum is surely one of the most famous structures in the world even they who have never been to the spot would recognize it from those myriad reproductions especially one would think an italian nevertheless while thus discoursing man came up to us man who politely inquired could you tell the name of this castello i am glad to think that some account of the rich and singular ﬂora of the coliseum has been preserved by deakin and sebastiani and possibly by others i could round their ef forts by describing the fauna of the coliseum the fauna of the coliseum especially after 1 1 would make readable book readable but hardly printable these little local studies are not without charm somebody one day may be induced to tell us about the fauna of trafalgar

appropriately enough i encountered this afternoon that most charming of persons who like shelley and others has discovered italy to be paradise of exiles his friends may guess whom i mean when i say that is connoisseur of earthquakes social and ﬁnancial his existence has been punctuated by them to such an extent that he longer counts events from dates in the ordinary calendar from birthdays or christmas or easter but from such and such disaster af fecting himself each has left him seemingly more mellow than the last just then however he was in pensive mood his face all puckered into wrinkles he glanced upon the tawny ﬂood rolling beneath that old bridge there he stood leaning over the parapet all by himself he turned his countenance aside on seeing to escape detection but i drew nigh none the less go away he said disturb just now i am watching the little ﬁshes life is so complicated let us pray i have begun new novel and new affair god prosper both i replied and began to move of thanks but supposing the publisher always objects to your choicest paragraphs i am not altogether surprised if they are anything like what you once read to out of your unexpur gated of the seven harlots why not try another ﬁrm they might be more accommodating try mine he shook his head dubiously they are all alike it is with publishers with wives one always wants somebody else and when you have them where the dif ference ah let us pray these little ﬁshes have none of our troubles i inquired about the new romance at ﬁrst he refused to disclose anything then he told it was to be entitled w ith christ at harvard and that it promised some rather novel situations i shall look forward to its appearance what good things one could relate of but the risk of incurring his wrath it is thousand pities i often tell him that he is still alive i am yearning to write his biography and can not af ford to wait his dissolution when i am dead he always says by that time my dear i shall be in the

start building anew the most sensitive recluse can not help being member of society such he unavoidably gathers about him host of mere acquaintances good folks who waste his time dulling the edge of his wit and infecting him with their orthodoxy then comes the cataclysm he loses let us say all his money or makes third appearance in the divorce courts he can then at last so one of them expressed it to revise his an operation which more than counterbalances any damage from earthquakes these same good folks are vanished the scandal having scattered them to the winds he begins to breathe again and employ his hours to better purpose if he loses both money and reputation he must feel i should think though treading on air the last fools gone and sage lacks friends consider well your neighbour what an imbecile he is then ask yourself whether it be worth while paying any attention to what he thinks of you life is too short and death the end of all things life must be lived not endured were

was particular friend of his however that may be he waxed wroth and banished the conscientious sculptor in disgrace to this lonely mountain village there to expiate his sins day or two one sleeps badly here those nightingales they are worse than the in town they begin earlier they make more noise surely there is time everything will certain birds never learn to sing at reasonable hours word to these nightingales one of them elects to warble in deplorably ease immediately below my bedroom window when this particular fowl sets up its din at about it is veritable explosion an explosion of noise i use that word noise deliberately it is not music not until your ears are grown accustomed to it i know little something about music having studied the art with considerable diligence number of years impossible to enumerate all the composers and executants on various instruments the conductors and singers and with whom i was on terms of familiarity during that incarnation perhaps i am the only person now alive who has shaken hands with man lachner who shook hands with beethoven and heard his voice all of which may appear when i come to indite my musical memoirs i have written sonata in four movements opus 643 hitherto unpublished and played the or gan during divine service to crowded congregation furthermore i performed not at my own suggestion his insipid valse caprice to the great antoine rubinstein who was kind enough to observe y es yes quite good but i rather doubt whether you could yet risk playing that in concert and in the matter of sheer noise i am also something of an expert having once an infant prodigy broken ﬁve notes in single masterly rendering of liszt polonaise in major i think it is major whereupon my teacher himself pupil of liszt genially remarked now cry and apologize polonaise like yours is worth piano i set these things down with modest difﬁdence solely in order to establish my locus standi person who might be expected to know the dif ference between sound and noise such i have hesitation in saying that the ﬁrst three bars of that nightingale performance are to sleeping ears not music they break upon the stillness with the crash of judgment day the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https every night the same scare it causes to start up bathed in sudden perspiration out of my ﬁrst and best and often only sleep with the familiar feeling that something awful is happening windows seem to rattle plaster drops from the ceiling an earthquake lord nothing so trivial nothing so brief it is that blasted bird clearing its throat ﬁve hours entertainment let it not be supposed that the song of these southerners bears any resemblance to that of an english nightingale i could stand hatful of english nightingales in my bedroom they would lull to sleep with their anaemic whispers you might well compare the voice of an italian costermonger the crowing of cock the braying of local donkey with their representatives in the north those thin trickles of sound shadowy the squeakings of ghosts something will have to be done about those nightingales unless i am to ﬁnd my way into sanatorium hardly is this bird started on its work before ﬁve or six others begin to shout in emulation little further of f i am glad to say but still near enough to be inconvenient still near enough to be reached by brick from this window brick methinks i begin to see daylight meanwhile one can snatch little rest out of doors in the afternoon delectable path example runs up behind the cemetery bordered by butterﬂy orchids and lithospermum and aristolochia and other plants worthy of better names it winds aloft under shady chestnuts with views on either side here one can sit and smoke and converse with some rare countryman passing by here one can dream getful of nightingales soothed rather by the melliﬂuous note of the oriole among the green branches overhead and the piping agreeably remote of some wryneck in the olives down yonder the birds are having quiet time the ﬁrst time in their lives sportsmen are all at the front i kicked up partridge along this track two days ago those wrynecks by the way are abundant but hard to see they sit close relying on their protective colour and it is the same with the i have heard englishmen say there are in italy the olive groves are well stocked with them there are numbers even in the bor ghese gardens in rome but you must remain immovable rock in order to see them they are yet shyer more silent more fond of interposing the trunk between yourself and them than those at home in hue in movement and voice strange case of analogous variation to this scalambra this mountain whose bleak grey summit overtops everything near olevano i could soon bear the sight of it longer it seemed to shut out the world one must up and glance over the edge to see what is happening on the other side i looked guide and porter somebody more solid than giulio who is almost an infant none could be found men are growing scarce the dodo hereabouts on account of the war so giulio came though he had never made the ascent now common sense to say nothing of glance at the map would suggest the proper method of approach by the village of serrano the saint michael hermitage and so up scouting this plan i attacked the mountain about way between that village and rojate i can not recommend my route it was wearisome to the last degree and absolutely shadeless save small piece of jungle clothing gulley hung with myriads of caterpillars and not worth mentioning an incident in that long walk excitement not the faintest chance so far i could see of breaking one neck and uphill all the time over limestone one never seems to get any nearer this scalambra i soon discovered is one of those artful mountains which defend their summits by thrusting out escarpments with valleys in between you are kept at the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https it were by this arrangement of the rock which is invisible at distance and when at last you set foot on the real ridge and climb laboriously to what seems to be the top lo there is another peak little further of f obviously few feet higher up you go only to discover third perhaps few inches higher still alpine climbers know these tricks we reached the goal none the less and there lay panting and gasping while an eagle solitary eagle with tattered wings ﬂoated overhead in the cloudless sky the descent to rojate under that blazing sun was bad enough my ﬂask had been drained to the dregs long ago and the scalambra true to its limestone tradition had not supplied even drop of water arriving at the village at about two in the afternoon we found it deserted everybody enjoying their sunday nap rojate is dirty hole the water was plainly not to be trusted it might contain typhoid germs and i was responsible giulio health wine would be safer we agreed there in little shop near the church dark and cool place the ﬁrst shade we had entered many hours we drank without ever growing less thirsty we felt like cinders so hot so porous that the liquid seemed not only to ﬁnd its way into the legitimate receptacle but to be obliged to percolate by some occult process of capillarity the remotest regions of the body time went on the inhabitants dropped in after their slumbers and kept us company we told our adventures drank to the health of the allies one by one and several times over and it was not until we had risen to our feet and passed once more into the sunshine of the square that we suddenly felt different from what we thought we felt the ﬁrst indication was conveyed by giulio who called upon the populace of rojate there assembled to bear solemn witness to the fact that i was his one and only friend and that he would nevermore abandon sentiment in which i stoutly concurred makes us wondrous blind other symptoms followed his hat example which had hitherto behaved in exemplary fashion now refused to remain steadily balanced on his head it took some gymnastics to prevent it from falling to the ground in fact while i conﬁned myself to the minor part of silenus my native role this youngster gave noteworthy representation of the drunken faun now i see harm in appreciating wine up to certain point and am consoled to observe that craufurd tait ramage was of the same way of thinking he says so himself and there is reason doubting his word he frankly admits instance that he enjoys the stuf f called moscato with great zest he samples the falernian vintage and pronounces it to be particularly good and not degenerated arrived at cutro he is not averse to reviving his spirits with pretty fair modicum of wine he also lets slip signiﬁcant detail the fact that dr henderson was one of his friends and that he travelled about with him you may judge man by the company he keeps who was this dr henderson he was the author of the history of ancient wines old henderson i should say could be trusted to know something of local vintages and so far good at licenza however ramage tells us that he got glorious on the wine of horace sabine farm i not know what he means by this expression which seems to be purposely ambiguous in any case it does not sound very nice at another place again he and his entertainer consumed some excellent liquor in considerable quantity so he avows adding that it was long past midnight ere we closed our bacchanalian or gies and he the host ended the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https that he was happy to have made my acquaintance note the lame and colourless close of that sentence he ended by stating one always ends that way after bacchanalian or gies though one does not always gloss over the escapade with such disingenuous language we can guess what really took place it was something like what happened at rojate did not the giulio end by stating something to the same effect i can not make up my mind whether to be pleased with this particular trait in friend ramage character let it never be gotten that our traveller was young man at the time he says so himself and there is reason doubting his word was he acting beseemed his years i am not more than many people yet i confess it always gives kind of twinge to see young man yielding to intemperance of any kind there is something incongruous in the spectacle if not actually repellent rightly or wrongly one is apt to associate that time of life with stern resolve young man it appears to should hold himself well in hand youth has so much to spare youth can af ford to be virtuous with such stores of joy looming ahead it should be period of ideals of and discipline of earnestness of purpose how well the greek anthology praises temperance the nurse of youth the divine plato lays it down that youngsters should not touch wine at all since it is not right to heap ﬁr on ﬁr he adds that older men like ourselves may indulge therein an ally against the austerity of their years agreeing therefore with theophrastus who likewise recommends it the natural moroseness of age observe in this connection what happened to craufurd tait ramage at trebisacce here was poor old coastguard who had been taken prisoner by the corsairs thirty years earlier carried to algiers and afterwards ransomed having nothing better to says our author i confess i furnished him with somewhat more wine than was exactly consistent with propriety with so liberal quantity indeed that the coastguard became quite obstreperous in his mirth whereupon ramage hops on his mule and leaves him to his fate here then we have young fellow deliberately leading an old man astray and why because he has nothing better to 13 it is not remarkably edifying true he afterwards makes kind of apology causing my brother to sin by over but if we close our eyes to the fact that ramage when he gave way to these excesses was young man and ought to have known better what an agreeable companion we ﬁnd him he never rails at anything had i been subjected to half the annoyances he endured my curses would have been loud and long under such provocation ramage contents himself with reproving his tormentors in rounded phrases of oratio obliqua which savour strongly of those latin classics he knew so well what he says of the countryfolk is not only polite but true that their virtues are their own while their vices have been fostered by the abuses of tyranny whatever fault one may ﬁnd with this people their superstition and ignorance there is loveableness in their character which i am not utilitarian enough in my philosophy to resist this comes of travelling of f the beaten track and with an open mind it comes of direct contact when one remembers that he wrote in 1828 and was derived from bigoted stock his religious tolerance is refreshing astonishing he studies the observances of the poorer classes with sympathetic eye and ﬁnds that they are pious to degree to which i am afraid we must grant that we have pretensions that custom the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https votive of ferings in churches he does not think worthy of being altogether condemned or ridiculed the feeling is the same that induces us on recovery from severe illness to give thanks to almighty god either publicly in church or privately in our closets how many calvinists of would write like this we could with more of these sensible and humane reﬂections but unfortunately he is generally too pressed time to indulge in them that mania of hustling through the country one morning he ﬁnds himself at foggia with the intention of visiting mons garganus first of all he must satisfy his curiosity about arpi it is ten miles there and back leaving foggia the second time he proceeds twenty miles to manfredonia and inspects not only this town but the site of old sipontum then he sails to the village of mattinata and later to vieste the furthermost point of the promontory about six miles to the north are the presumable ruins of merinum he insists upon going there but the boatmen strike work regretfully he returns to manfredonia arriving at 1 1 and having covered on this day some sixty or seventy miles what does he at manfredonia he sleeps three hours and then new hustle begins in pitch darkness another day he wakes up at sorrento and thinks he will visit the siren islets he crosses the ridge and descends to the sea on the other side to the scaricatojo quite respectable walk any one can ﬁnd out himself hence he sails to the lar ger of the islets climbs to the summit and makes some excavations in the course of which he observes what i thought i was the ﬁrst to discover the substructures of noble roman villa he also scrambles into king robert tower then to the next islet and up it then to the third and up it after that he is tempted to visit the headland of minerva he goes there and satisﬁes his curiosity he must now hence to capri he sails across and after little refreshment walks to the villa of jupiter at the easterly apex of the island he then rows round the southern shore and is taken with the idea of trip to misenum twenty miles or so distant arrived there he climbs to the summit of the cape and lingers while it is pleasant to ﬁnd him lingering to examine something or other then he rushes down to the boat and bids them row to pozzuoli where he arrives and wonder long after sunset good day hustle the ladies made great impression on his sensitive mind yet not even they were allowed to interfere with his plans at strongoli the sparkling eyes of the younger sister proved the most attractive object in the place he was strongly ur ged to remain while and rest from his fatigues but there were many reasons why he should press forward he therefore presses forward at another place too he was waited upon by his entertainer three daughters the youngest of whom was one of the most entrancing girls he had ever met fact it was well that his time was limited else i verily believe i should have committed all kinds of follies that is ramage he parts from his host with unfeigned regret but parts his time is always limited bit that craze of pressing forward what fun he could have had stroll to that grove of oaks crowning above the serpentaro stream it has often been described often painted it is corner of latium in perfect preservation glamorous place in the warm dusk of southern twilight when all those tiresome children are at last asleep it calls up suggestions of midsummer

water from below from spot which i was too lazy to investigate where perhaps the soft tertiary rock leans upon this impervious stuf f and allows the liquid to escape into the open an unclean place is bellegra and loud like all these sabine villages with the confused crying of little children that multiple wail of misery will ring in your ear days afterwards they are more neglected by their mothers than ever since women now have all the men work in the ﬁelds to they are hungrier than ever on account of the war which has imposed real hardships on these agricultural folk hardships that seize them by the throat and make them sit down with folded hands in dumb despair so i have seen them how many of these unhappy babies will grow to maturity must anyhow be high hereabouts nothing is done in the way of hygiene in the company of one who knows i perambulated the cemetery of olevano and was astonished at the frequency of tombstones erected to the young consumption my friend told they scorn prophylactics i should not care to send growing children into these villages despite their ﬁne air here at bellegra the air must be ﬁne indeed in winter too ﬁne my taste it lies high exposed to every blast of heaven and with noble views in all directions rest awhile on your homeward march at the small bridge near olevano where the road takes turn few hundred yards up the glen on your left is fountain whose waters are renowned their purity the bridge itself is not favourite spot after sunset it is haunted by most malignant spectre that adds considerably in my eyes to the charm of the place besides here stands an elder tree now in full ﬂower what recollections does that scent evoke what hints of summer after rain venerable tree old the hills that last syllable tells its tale you may read it in the sanscrit tree seldom one sees an elder by itself away from human habitations in the jungle i have done so but in that the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https buried

one time or another at yonder abandoned of late but then ﬁlled with crowd of noisy enthusiasts who have since been sacriﬁced to the war doubtless he drank wine with them on that terrace overlooking the brown houses of olevano though i question whether he then paid much they are now charging doubtless he rejoiced to see that stately array of white lilies fronting the landscape though i question whether he derived more pleasure from them than i while at bellegra this afternoon i gazed landwards to where in the abruzzi region the peaks are still shrouded in snow how are they doing our there at scanno is that at last ﬁnished can the river danube still be heard ﬂowing under ground in the little cave of saint martin are the thistles of violet and red and blue and gold and silver gor geous ever

on the rubble of that shattered mountain which produced the lake lower down it has probably crumbled away in the last earthquake well i remember frattura it was where the wolf ate the donkey and where we in our turn often refreshed ourselves in the dim hovel of ferdinando never with greater zest than on the hot downward march from mount genzana whether those small purple gentians are still to be found on its summit and the emerald lizard on the lower slopes whether the eagles still breed on the neighbouring montagna di preccia they may well be tired of having their nest plundered year after year what foreigner has older and pleasanter memories of scanno i would like to meet that man and compare notes and so glancing over the hills from bellegra i sent my thoughts into those abruzzi mountains and registered vow to revisit scanno if only in order to traverse once more by moonlight the sake of auld lang syne the devious paths to roccaraso or linger in that moist nook by the where stood the scanno of olden days the betifuli if such it was of the pelignians where the apples grow where the sly dabchick plays among the reeds and where one evening i listened to something that might have been said much sooner acque v ive i kept my vow our bill at scanno wine alone was 189 francs and beer 92 francs ﬁgures which look more formidable than they are and which i cite only to prove that we of course i was not alone enjoyed ourselves fairly well during those eighteen days by the way what does baedeker mean the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https of the excellent

prospered too much my taste since those rich smoky tints especially of the vaulted interiors are now disappearing under an invasion of iron beams and white plaster the golden duskiness of scanno

will of god what else should they teach but men will outgrow these doctrines of patience when suf fering is too acute or too prolonged anything is better than this they say thus it comes about that these ruined regions are goodly soil the sowing of subversive opinions the land reeks of socialism we found restaurant where we lunched of f tin of antediluvian spanish sardines some mouldy sweet biscuits and black wine distinction is made in these parts between black and red wine the former is the apulian variety the other from sulmona during this repast we were treated to several bear stories there are bears at pescasseroli and nowhere else in italy even there are chamois nearby between opi and villetta barrea among the crags of the camosciara which perpetuates their name one of those present assured us that the bear is good beast he will eat man of course but if he meets little boy he contents himself with throwing stones at him just to teach him good manners certain old bears are big donkey they have been seen driving into their cave ﬂock of sheep like any shepherd it is rare thing to encounter in the woods bear with goat slung over his shoulder he must breakfast like anybody else one of these gentlemen told us that the bears not long ago were source of considerable proﬁt to the peasantry round about it was in this wise their numbers had been reduced it seems to single pair and the species was threatened with extinction when somehow or other this state of af fairs became known to the king who alarmed at the disappearance from his realm of venerable and autochtonous quadruped the lar gest european beast of prey conceived the happy idea of converting the whole region into royal preserve on pain of death bear was to be molested or even laughed at any damage they might would be compensated out of the royal purse week or so after this enactment nothing was heard of the bears then one morning the conscientious minister of the royal household presented himself at the palace with lar ge sheaf of documents under his arm what have we here inquired the king attestations relating to the bears of pescasseroli your majesty they seem to be thriving ah that is nice of them they are multiplying once more thanks to our royal protection we thought they would multiplying indeed sire here are testimonials sworn before the local syndic showing that they have devoured 18 head of cattle and 43 sheep in that short time is it possible well well the damage must be paid and yet we never knew the bears could propagate so fast maybe our italian variety is peculiarly vigorous in such matters seems so your majesty very proliﬁc the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https week or so passed and once more his excellency was announced the king observed you are not looking quite yourself this morning my good minister would it be indiscreet to inquire the cause family or parliamentary worries we trust your majesty is very kind it is the bears of pescasseroli they have eaten 75 head of cattle 93 sheep and 1 14 goats ah and 18 horses here are the claims damages notarially attested we must pay but if only somebody could teach the dear creatures to breed little more reasonably i can not but think sire that the peasants are abusing your majesty may we never live to hear anything against our faithful and abruzzi folk nearly month elapsed before the minister again presented himself this time he looked really haggard and careworn and was bowed down under an enormous bundle of papers the king glanced up from that where like all other sovereigns he had been working steadily since and at once remarked with that sympathetic intuition which he is famous among crowned heads we think we know the bears your majesty is never wrong they have devoured 126 cows and calves and bullocks 418 sheep and goats 62 mules 37 horses and 96 donkeys also 55 shepherd dogs and 827 chickens here are the claims dear dear dear this will never if it is question of going to ruin we prefer that it should be the bears rather than ourselves we must withdraw our royal protection after settling up these last items what say you my good minister your majesty is always right private individual may indulge in the pastime of breeding bears to the ver ge of personal bankruptcy ruling sovereigns will be guided by juster and more complex considerations and from that moment added our gentlemanly informant there began wonderful shrinkage in the numbers of the bears within day or two they were again reduced to single couple gladly would i have listened to more of these tales but having by far the worst of the day walk still before us we left the stricken regions about midday and soon began an interminable ascent all through woods to the shrine of madonna di tranquillo hereabouts is the watershed whence you may see far below the tower of campoli apennino that village was passed in due course and sora lay before us after thirteen hours march that same night in sora it may have been 2 some demon drew nigh to my bedside and whispered in my ear what are you doing here at sora why not revisit alatri i had been there already in june just another little promenade up sluggard while the is cool i obeyed the summons and turned to rouse my slumbering companion to whom i announced my inspiration his remarks on that occasion were the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https listening to next evening found us at alatri now whoever after walking from scanno over pescasseroli to sora in one day and on the next in the blazing heat of early autumn from sora over isola liri and veroli to alatri touching in two days the soil of three italian provinces aquila caserta and rome whoever after doing this and inspecting the convent of casamari en route feels inclined similar promenade on the third day let him rest assured of my profound respect calm sunny days at olevano and tranquil nights some time past the nightingale has been inspired to move little up country into another bush its rivals have likewise retired further of f and their melodramatic trills sound quite pleasant at this distance so tin cans have their uses even when empty certain building operations may have been interrupted i apologise though i will not promise not to repeat the of fence they can move their nests i can not move this house bless their souls i would not hurt hair on their dear little heads but one must really have few hours sleep somehow or other single night repose is more precious to than myriad birds or quadrupeds or bipeds my ideas on the sacred nature of sleep being perfectly oriental that black hole of calcutta was an infamous business and yet while nowise approving the tyrant action i can thoroughly understand his instructions on the subject of slumber not every one at olevano is so callous waiting the other day at the bifurcation of the roads the arrival of the station motor the social event of the place i noticed two children bringing up to bigger one the nest of chafﬁnch artfully frosted over with silver lichen from some olive and containing naked brood which sprawled pathetically within was it pretty they asked very pretty he replied now you will take it straight back where you found it go ahead i am coming with you and he marched them of i am glad to put this incident on record it is the second of its kind which i have observed in this country the ﬁrst being when ﬁsherman climbed up bad piece of rock to replace nest idle undertaking which some boys had dislodged with stones at short distance from the scene sat the mother in pensive mood her head cocked on one side what did she think of the benevolent enthusiast olevano is said to have been discovered by the germans i am sceptical on this point having never yet found place that was discovered by them an english eccentric or two is sure to have lived and died here all by himself though doubtless once on the spot they did their best to popularise and vulgarise it in this matter in art or science or every department of life german requires forerunners he must follow footsteps he gleans picks the brains of other people proﬁts by their mistakes and improves on their ideas i know nothing of the social history of olevano of its origin so far foreigners are concerned it is the easiest and the ﬂimsiest thing in the world to invent there are so many analogies the ﬁrst foreign resident of olevano was retired army ofﬁcer with unblemished record major frederick potter he came across the place the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https trip from rome and took fancy to it decent climate passable food you could pick up woodcock or two he was accustomed to solitude anyhow all his old friends being dead or buried or scattered about the world he had tried england couple of years and discovered that people there did not like being ordered about they should be they seemed to mind it less at olevano he had always been something of pioneer and the mere fact of being the ﬁrst white man in the place gave him kind of fondness it it was he then who discovered olevano freddy potter we can see him living alone wiry and whiskered and cantankerous glorying in his solitude up to the fateful day when to his inﬁnite annoyance turns up mr augustus browne of london mr browne is blameless personality who enjoying indif ferent health brings an equally blameless old housekeeper with him he is not sportsman like potter but indulges in pretty taste landscape painting with elaborate ﬂowers and butterﬂies worked into the foreground so they live each in jealous seclusion drinking tea at ﬁxed hours importing groceries from england dressing dinner avoiding contact with the natives and of course pretending to be unaware of one another existence time goes on their mutual distrust grows stronger the major has never forgiven that cockney invading olevano his private domain while browne ﬁnds words to express his disgust at potter who presumably calls himself briton and yet smokes those ﬁlthy cheroots in public this was years and years ago why is the fellow skulking here all by himself some panky with regimental money every one knows how india plays the devil with man sense of right and wrong and potter is not long in making up his mind that this civilian has bolted to olevano reasons which will not bear investigation and is living in retirement ten to one under an assumed name browne he really might have picked out better one while he was about it that water business blind red herring the lady companion the natives meanwhile observe with amazement the mutual conduct of two compatriots they are known far and wide the madmen till some bright spirit makes the discovery that they are not madmen at all but only homicides hiding from justice whereupon contempt is changed to grudging admiration browne dies after many years his lady packs up and departs the old major delight at being once more alone is of short duration he falls ill and is entombed his last days being embittered by the arrival of party of german tourists who declare they have discovered this wonderful new spot and threaten to bring more teutons in their rear to participate in its joys they come singly and in batches and soon make olevano uninhabitable to men of the potter and browne type they keep the taverns open all night sing boisterous choruses kiss each other in the street if they were in their bedrooms or ganise picnics in the woods sketch old women sitting in old doorways start verschoenerungsver ein and indulge in number of other antics which from the local point of view are held to be either coarse or childish the natives after watching their doings with critical interest presently pronounce verdict verdict to which the brightest spirits of the place give their assent verdict which by the way i have myself heard uttered those englishmen thus it runs were at least assassins these people are merely fools the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https one thing has occurred of late which would hardly have happened were the germans still in occupation of olevano at the central piazza is fountain where the cattle drink and where formerly you could rest and glance down upon the country lying below upon piece of green landscape peering in upon the street this little view was like window it gave an aerial charm to the place they have now blocked it up with an ugly house the beauty of the site is gone it is surprising that local municipalities however stupid however corrupt should not be aware of the damage done to their own interests when they permit such outrages the germans were any of them still here would doubtless have interfered en masse and stopped the building something should be done about these reviewers there has followed hither bundle of press notices of recent book of mine they are favourable i ought to be delighted i happen to be annoyed what takes place in this absurd book the three unities are preserved respectable but rather drab individual bishop whose tastes and moods are fashioned to reﬂect those of the average drab reader arrives at new place and is described being among other things peculiarly sensitive on the subject of women he can not bear ﬂippant allusions to the sex he has preserved childlike faith in their purity their sacred mission on earth their reﬁning inﬂuence upon the race his friends call him and quixotic on this point true woman he declares can wrong and this same man towards the end of the book watches how the truest woman in the place the one whom he admires more than all the rest his own cousin and mother calmly throws her legitimate husband over clif he realises that he is face to face with an atrocious and carefully planned murder such however has been the transformation of his mind during twelve days sojourn that he understands the crime he pardons it he approves it can this wholesale change of attitude be brought about without plot yet many of these reviewers discover such thing in the book it possesses not the faintest shadow of plot says one of the most reputable of them this annoys i see reason why book should have plot in regard to this one it would be nearer the truth to say that it is nothing but plot from beginning to end how to make murder palatable to bishop that is the plot how you must unconventionalise him and instil into his mind the seeds of doubt and revolt you must shatter his old notions of what is right it is the only way to achieve this result and i would defy the critic to point to single incident or character or conversation in the book which does not further the object in view the good bishop soon ﬁnds himself among new inﬂuences his sensations his intellect are assailed from within and without figures such those in chapters 1 1 19 and 35 the endless dialogue in the boat the even more tedious happenings in the local the very externals relaxing wind and fantastic landscape and volcanic phenomena the jovial immoderation of everything and everybody they foster sense of violence and insecurity they all tend to make the soil receptive to new ideas if that was your plot the reviewer might say you have hidden it rather successfully i have certainly done my best to hide it although the personalities of the villain and his legal spouse crop up periodically with ominous insistence from the ﬁrst chapter onwards they are always swallowed up again the reason is given in the penultimate chapter where the critic might have found résumé of my intentions and the key to this plot to the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https murder under those particular circumstances is not only justiﬁable and commendable but insigniﬁcant quite insigniﬁcant not worth troubling about hundreds of decent and honest folk are being destroyed every day nobody cares tuppence one dirty blackmailer more or less what does it matter to anybody there are so many more interesting things on earth that is why the bishop the reader here discovers the crime to be contemptible little episode and decides to relegate it into the category of unimportant events he was glad that the whole affair had r emained in the backgr ound so to speak of his local experiences it seemed appr opriate in the background it seemed appropriate that is the heart the core of the plot and that is why all those other happenings ﬁnd themselves pushed into the foreground i know full well that this is not the way to write an orthodox english novel if you hide your plot how shall the critic be expected to see it you must serve it on tray you must to vary the simile hit the nail on the head and ask him to be so good to superintend the operation that is the way to rejoice the cockles of his heart he can then compare you to someone else who has also hit the nail on the head and with whose writings he happens to be familiar you have ﬂavour of dostoievsky minus the dickens taint you remind him of flaubert or walter scott or somebody equally obscure in short you are in condition to be labelled word and thing which comes perilously near to libelling if to this description he adds short summary of your ef fort he has done his duty what more can he he must not praise overmuch that might displease some of his own literary friends he must not blame overmuch else how shall his paper survive it lives on the advertisements of publishers and say those persons perhaps wisely if you our authors there an end to our custom commercialism which applies far less to literary criticism than to other kinds of most of the critics of music and art the best one can say is that

hour contemplation of the beauties of nature i descended once more through that ilex grove to serrone and now it began to grow decidedly warm the wide depression between this village and olevano used

lamps at this distance of twelve miles the brigands have evidently spared expense in the matter of and now the lights of segni station are visible down in the malarious valley where the train passes from rome to naples every night i have beheld them from my window every night they tinged my thoughts with soft sadness driving them backwards northwards creating link between present and past now the

let the centuries roll by watching the tramp of roman legions and papal mercenaries and all that succession of proud banners which have ﬂoated down this ancient via labiena that structure visible in the morning hours from olevano is monstrous palace containing among other things training school carbineers attached thereto is church whose interior has an unusual shape the usual smell and tablet commemorating visit from pius ix there is beautiful open space up here with wide views over the surrounding country it gives food thought what an ideal spot one says the populace to frequent on the evenings of these sultry days it is empty at that hour utterly deserted now why they prefer to jostle each other in the narrow squalid and stuf fy lane lower down one would like to know the reason this preference i enquired and was told that the upper place was not sufﬁciently the explanation is not wholly convincing they have the lighting arrangements in their own hands and could easily afford the outlay it may be that they like to remain close to the shops and to each other doors conversational purposes since it is fact that socially speaking the more restricted the area the more expansive

opulent vest and corduroy trousers his feet were encased in rough some peasant proprietor very likely who rode his own horses was he going to tell anything of interest about artena presumably not he

velletri now extirpated the deserters were nearly all children the latest conscripts grown man seldom deserts not because he would not like to so but because he has more judgment and can weigh the risks the roads were patrolled by police few murders had taken place yes just few murders one or two stupid people who resented their demands money or food he broke of f with another weary smile you have had malaria i suggested often the fact was patent not only from his sallow face but from the peculiar manner they brought in deserter that very afternoon he lay groaning at the bottom of cab

notary put the case united italy intervention against germany military discipline and the shooting of cowardly deserters into few phrases so clear so convincing that there was general burst of approval then another man said i hate those sicilians i have good personal reasons hating them but sicilian fears death if they are not brilliant soldiers they certainly make class assassins which is only another branch of the same business this boy deserts not because he is afraid of death but because he still owes debt he feels he ought to something to repay his parents who nursed him when he was child and not be sacriﬁced to that kidnapping camorra of blackguards out yonder and he pointed with his thumb spitting contemptuously the while in the direction of the project gutenberg ebook of

stroll yesterday with wild youngster from the village of joy to listen to analphabetics change they are indubitably the salt of the earth down that track to crapolla only to learn that my friend garibaldi the ancient ﬁsherman the genius loci has died in the interval thence by boat to the lonely beach of recomone sadly noting we passed that the at the grotto delle palumbe are now all extirpated where the sake of old memories i indulged in bathe and then came across an object rare in these regions fragment of grey egyptian granite relic of some pagan temple and doubtless washed up here in wintry gale thence little light refreshment to nerano thence to that house of the spirits where my was begun in the company of one who feared spirits victim already of this cursed war but then laughter loving child and down to the bay and promontory of ierate there to make the unwelcome discovery that certain hideous quarrying operations on the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https hill have utterly ruined the charm of this once secluded site thence laboriously upwards past that line of venerable to the summit of mount san costanzo nothing has changed the bay of naples lay at my feet of old ﬂooded in sunshine there is small outdoor cistern here peering into its darkness through an aperture in the roof i noticed that there was water at the bottom out of the water projected stone on the stone prisoner life sat the most disconsolate lizard imaginable it must have tumbled through the chink during some scufﬂe with companion into this humid cell swum refuge to that islet and there remained feeding on the gnats which live in such places i observed that its tail had grown to an inordinate length from disuse very likely from lack of the usual abrasion against shrubs and stones an unenviable fate one of these restless and creatures never again to see the sun to live and die down here all alone in the dank gloom chained it were to few inches of land amid desolation of black water it took my thoughts back to what i saw two days ago while climbing in the torrid hour of noon up that shadeless path where the orchids grow the path which runs from sant elia past the shattered natural arch to fontanella here at the hottest turning of the road sat woman in great distress beside her was pink pig she had been commissioned to escort down to the farm of sant elia this beast was suf fering hellish torments from the heat and vainly endeavouring with frenzied grunts of despair to excavate itself hollow in the earth under thinly clothed myrtle bush i told the woman of shade lower down she said she knew about it but the pig the pig refused to move it had been engaged upon this hopeless occupation without moment respite an hour or more nothing would induce it to proceed step further it had plainly made up its mind to ﬁnd shelter here from the burning rays or die and of shelter there was none what would not this pig i now thought have given to be transported into the lizard cool aquatic paradise and the lizard into that scorching sunlight it was not to muse upon the miseries of the animal creation that i have revisited these shores i came to puzzle once more over the site of that far famed athene temple which gave its name to the whole promontory now after again traversing the ground with inﬁnite pleasure i fail to ﬁnd any reason changing what i wrote years ago in certain pamphlet which some scholar glancing through these pages and anxious to explore himself spot of such celebrity in ancient days is so little likely to see that he may not be sorry if i here recapitulate its ar guments others will be well advised to pass over what follows let begin by saying that the temple in every probability stood at the punta campanella facing capri the actual headland of the sorrentine peninsula where apart from every other kind of evidence you may pick up to this day small ﬁgures of athene made presumably to be carried away keepsakes by visitors to the shrine now alternative suggestions strabo tells us that the temple was placed on the akron of the promontory that is the summit of mount san costanzo where we are now standing he elsewhere describes it being on the straits this summit is nearly 500 metres above the and here antique building seems ever to have been erected traces of old life are visible save some fragments of the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https which may have found their way up in early byzantine days even modern worshippers carry up the ephemeral vessels popularly called caccavelle 18 and scatter them about with the exception of one fragment of white pentelic marble materials of an early period have been incorporated into the masonry of the little chapel or the walls of the ﬁelds below it is incredible that vestige of structure like the athene temple should remain on spot of this kind so favourably situated regards immunity from depredations owing to its isolated and exalted position the around the summit has not under gone that artiﬁcial levelling which an ediﬁce of this importance would necessitate the terrace is of mediaeval construction can be seen by its supporting walls doubt the venerable christian sanctuary there has been frequently repaired and modiﬁed on the to the south can be seen the foundations of an earlier chapel and the slopes are littered with broken bricks sorrentine tufa and old battuto ﬂoors but there is trace of antique workmanship or material nor has the rocky path leading up to the shrine been demarcated with in the ancient fashion the sister of la croce is equally unproductive of classical relics we must therefore conclude that strabo was mistaken and why not his accounts of many parts of the roman world are surprisingly accurate but according to professor pais of italy strabo seems to have known merely the road which leads from brindisi to rome the road between rome and naples and pozzuoli and the coast of etruria between rome and populonia if so he probably saw more of the district than can be seen from naples he attributes the foundation of this athene temple to odysseus statements of such kind make one wonder whether the earlier portions of his lost history were more critical than other old treatises which have survived so much strabo seduced by modern name which means nothing more or less than temple strong evidence surely i was inclined to locate the athene shrine at spot called ierate marked also ieranto on some maps and popularly pronounced ghiérate the greek aspirate still surviving which lies mile or more eastwards of the punta campanella and faces hieron i thought that settles it you may guess i was not little proud of this discovery particularly when it turned out that an ancient building actually did stand there on the southern slope namely of the miniature peninsula which juts into ierate bay here i found fragments of antique bricks tegulae bipedales amphoras pottery of the lustrous sorrentine ware surrentina bibis pavements of opus signinum well one lar ge roman paving ﬂag of the type that is found on the road between termini and punta campanella how came this stone here did the old road from stabiae athene temple go round the promontory and continue far ierate along the southern slope of san costanzo hill road could pass there now deforestation has denuded the of its soil laying bare the grey rock condition at which its mediaeval name of mons canutarius already hints well more careful examination of the site has convinced that i was wrong temple of this magniﬁcence can have stood here but only roman villa one of the many which dotted these shores under the empire so much myself peutinger char t showing ancient road rounding the headland and terminating at t emplum minervae the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https the less and this is really curious point an inspection of peutinger tables seems to bear out my original theory of temple at ierate the structure is therein marked not at the punta campanella but approximately at ierate itself facing south with the road from stabiae over surrentum rounding the promontory and terminating at the temple threshold capri and the punta campanella are plainly drawn though not designated by name much i should like my ﬁrst speculation to be proved correct on the evidence of this old chart of 226 i fear both of us are mistaken so much peutinger tables beloch makes further confusion in regard to the local topography he says that the rock which eratosthenes describes separating the gulfs of cumae and paestum that is of naples and salerno is mount san costanzo i not understand beloch falling into this error the old geographer uses the term skopelos which is never applied to mountain of this size but to clif fs projecting upon the sea moreover the landmark is ther to this day i have not the slightest doubt that eratosthenes meant the pinnacle of ierate which is in remarkably and even absurdly conspicuous manner both when viewed from the sea and from the land from the chapel of della neve instance now this projecting clif f of three peaks they are called respectively montalto ierate and mortella ierate short is not the actual boundary between the two gulfs not by mile or more but from certain points it might well be mistaken it the ancients had charts like ours and the world in consequence presented itself dif ferently to their senses even strabo says bunbury was so ignorant of the general form and conﬁguration of the north african coast to have clear conception of the great projection formed by the carthaginian territory and the deep bay to the east of it and coasting along the shore line this skopelos behind which lies the inlet of ierate might possibly be mistaken the into the gulf of naples so it looks when viewed from the of capri so also from the siren islets veritable headland so much beloch and eratosthenes to sum up strabo is wrong in saying that the temple of athene stood on the summit of mount san costanzo i was wrong in thinking that this temple lay at ierate peutinger chart is wrong in ﬁguring the structure on the south side of the sorrentine peninsula beloch is wrong in identifying the skopelos trikoruphos of eratosthenes with mount san costanzo eratosthenes is wrong in locating his rock at the boundary between the two gulfs the shrine of athene lay doubtless at campanella whose crag is of sufﬁcient altitude to justify roman poets like statius in their descriptions of its lofty site so great number of old writers concur in this opinion donnorso persico giannettasio mazzella anastasio capaccio that their testimony would alone be overwhelming had these men been little more careful to what they

seen the whole question is discussed in filangieri recent history of massa 1910 it also occurs to that strabo term akron may mean an extremity or point projecting into the sea sense in which homer used it and be applicable therefore to the punta the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https here we are that mysterious nocturnal incident peculiar to rome has already occurred sure

is they who are responsible this sad lapse their sound is clear by day after midnight when the trafﬁc has died down it waxes thunderous he hears it through the window hears it perforce since the streets are ringing with that music and you can not close your ears he listens growing hotter and more restless every moment he thinks that splash of waters those frigid wavelets and cascades how delicious to bathe his limbs if only moment in their bubbling wetness he is parched with heat and at this hour of the night he reﬂects there will not be soul abroad in the square so he hearkens to the

at given moment exactly what she wants to and she never wants to more than one thing at time it is most unwomanly of her any other person of her sex would have left game of cards the sake of an attractive visitor like myself or that matter an ordinary lady would have played cards given complicated orders to dressmakers and servants and entertained half dozen men at the same time nichol can not these things that hand that rather sunburnt little hand without single ring on it has not moved from the table i am not blind it is quite evident that she wants to play cards only that and nothing more i withdraw stealthily not downstairs i go to linger awhile on the broad terrace where jessamine grows in gar gantuan tubs there i pace up and down admiring the cupolas and towers of rome that

child that has got into trouble and takes you into its conﬁdence one of these days i must write character of nichol she foreshadows type represents it very possibly type which will grow commoner from day to day she dreams of republic of women vestals or otherwise wherefrom all men are to be excluded unless they possess qualiﬁcations of rather unusual nature i think she would like to draft set of

hostilities by the provident hostess who must have anticipated rise in price deterioration in quality or both the result of war how came nichol to discover their whereabouts that is her af fair i know not how she has managed in so brief space of time to collect such variety of useful local information i can only testify that on her arrival in rome she knew more about the language and place than the proverbial babe unborn and that nowadays when anybody is faced with conundrum like mine one always hears the words t ry mrs nichol and how many women by the way would have made note of the particular quality of those macaroni one in hundred these are temperamental matters the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https also of course i took friend with old gentleman of whose downward

touch strega again we had prolonged ar gument over the cof fee about this strega adulteration during which i tried to make my friend comprehend how i thought the grievance ought to be remedied how by an injunction that was the way to redress these wrongs you obtain an injunction i said such the french chartreuse people obtained against the manufacturers of the italian certosa which was thereafter obliged to change its name to v al more than once i endeavoured to set forth in language intelligible to his understanding what an injunction signiﬁed more than once i explained how the strega company would be to take this course in vain he always missed my point he always brought in some personal element whereas i usual conﬁned myself to general lines to the principle of the thing italians are sometimes unfathomably obtuse but what is an injunction he repeated if you were little younger there might be some hope you i would then try to explain it again the ﬁftieth time instead of that what

of saima in finland who ever heard of seals living in sweet waters this was one of my happiest discoveries though the delight of my friend the curator was tempered by the fact that this particular specimen happened to be an immature one and did not display any pronounced i have early recollections of the rugged face and lovely scotch accent of tam edwards the banf fshire naturalist and much later ones of young 24 who gave circumstantial account of how he found the ﬁrst snow bunting nest in sutherlandshire i recall the rev mathew mathews of gumley an ardent leicestershire ornithologist whose friendship i gained at tender age on discovering the nest of legged partridge from which i took every one of the thirteen eggs surely six would have been enough he said remark which struck rather unreasonable seeing that french partridges were not exactly common linnets he afterwards showed his collection of birdskins dwelling lovingly reasons which i can not remember upon that of duck he it was who told that collector was worth his salt until he had learnt to skin his own birds fired with enthusiasm i took lessons in taxidermy at the earliest possible opportunity from grimy old naturalist in one of the grimiest streets of manchester man who relieved birds of their jackets in dainty fashion with one hand the other having been amputated and replaced by an iron hook during that period of initiation into the gentle art the at the weaste manchester was converted every morning purposes of study into chamber of horrors shambles where headless trunks and brains and eyes of lapwings and other easy birds i had not yet reached the arduous stage of the profession lay about in sanguinary morsels while the ﬂoor was in feathers and tables strewn with tweezers lancets arsenical paste corrosive sublimate and other paraphernalia of the trade the butler had to be furiously tipped there were lar ge grounds belonging to this estate ﬁelds and woodlands once green then blackened with soot and now cut up into allotments and built over here ever since men could remember certainly since the place had come into the possession of the never gotten mr edward kingﬁsher had dwelt by little streamlet of artiﬁcial origin which supported few withered minnows and sticklebacks and dace this kingﬁsher was one of the sights of the domain visitors were taken to see it the bird though sometimes coy was generally on view nevertheless it was an extremely prudent old kingﬁsher to my inﬁnite annoyance i never succeeded the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https it nor did i even ﬁnd its nest an additional source of grief lancashire naturalists may be interested to know that this bird was still on the spot in the i have the exact date somewhere 25 surely noteworthy state of af fairs so near the heart of smoky town like manchester later on i learnt to slay kingﬁshers the ﬁrst victim falling to my gun on day of rain it darted across ﬁeld to avoid the windings of brook i also became specialist at ﬁnding their nests birds are so conservative they are at your mercy if you care to study their habits the wren builds nest which is almost invisible once you have mastered the trick is safe i am sorry now all those plundered eggs and the rarer ones the grey shrike that buzzard of the clif f the most perilous scramble of all my life the crested titmouse the serin ﬁnch on the apple tree that ﬁrst icterine warbler whose ﬁve eggs blotched with purple and quite unfamiliar at the time gave such thrill of joy that i nearly lost my foothold on the swerving alder branch at this point my meditations were suddenly interrupted by vigorous grunt or snort snort that would have done credit to an enraged tapir my friend awoke refreshed he rubbed his eyes and looked round i remember he began sitting up i remember everything are you feeling better i hope so yes exactly where were we an injunction what did you say at it again i said it was the drawback of old people that they never know when they have had enough of an ar gument but what is an injunction how many more times you wish to make that clear shall i begin all over again have it your way when you go into court and ask the judge to something to prevent man from doing something he wants to when you not want him to it like that more or less so i gather but i confess i not see why man should not something he wants to just because you want him not to it you might well go into court and ask the judge to something to make man something he does not want to just because you want him to it ah but he must not in this case good lord have i not explained that thousand times already you always miss my point it is illegal you understand illegal illegal anybody can say that it would be very natural thing to say under the circumstances i should say it myself now just take my advice you go and tell your brother my brother it is not my brother you are quite beside the point why introduce this personal element it is the strega company strega liqueur i am talking about commercial concern obtaining an injunction burroughs and wellcome they got injunctions on the same grounds i know great deal of such things though i talk about them all day long other people would if they possessed half my knowledge company you see an injunction liqueur please to note that i am talking about company company have i now made myself clear or how many more times the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https one would think he was at least your brother from the way you take his part let us say he is friend then some never friend who is interested in shady liqueur business and now wants to make judge something to make man something wrong again to prevent man doing something w ants to something to make judge something to prevent man doing something he wants to because he does not want him to it is that right very well you tell your friend that italian judge is going to dirty work of that kind nothing dirty work god almighty i want any judge to dirty work doubt doubt i am quite convinced you but your priceless friend does come now why not be open about it open about what it is positively humiliating to be treated like this after all the years we have known each other i wish you would try to cultivate the virtue of frankness you are far too secretive something will really have to be done about it company company company consists of certain number of human beings why make mysteries about one of them it may happen to the best of mankind to be mixed up mixed up you are going to be disagreeable about my choice of words have it your way we all know you think you can talk better italian than the pope my own father i was going to say has been involved in some pretty dirty work in the course of his professional career doubt doubt and please to note that he is good man any brother of yours you always miss my point now try to be truthful once in your life out with it liqueur is that all sleep does not seem to have sharpened your wits to any great extent i was not asleep i was thinking about eggs company company you are waking up anything else an injunction distinguished writer some years ago started crusade in favour of pure english he wished to counteract those inﬂuences which are forever at work debasing the standard of language whether he seemed to think the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https should be inalterably ﬁxed is yet another question in literature in conversation there is pure english every moment of history that of our childhood is dif ferent from and to adopt the tongue of the bible or shakespeare because it happens to be pure looks like setting back the hands of the clock men would surely be dull dogs if their phraseology whether written or spoken were to remain stagnant and unchangeable we think well of johnson prose yet the respectable english of our own time will bear comparison with his it is more agile and less infected with latinisms why go back to johnson let us admire him landmark and pass on some literary periods may deserve to be called good others bad so be it were there bad ones there would be good ones and i see reason why men should desire to live in golden age of literature save in so far that millennium might coincide with golden age of living i doubt in the ﬁrst place whether they would be even aware of their privilege secondly every golden age grows fairer when viewed from distance besides and general consideration it strikes that vast deal of mischief is involved in these arbitrary divisions of literature into golden or other epochs they incite men to admire some mediocre writers and to disparage others they pervert our natural taste and their origin is academic laziness certain it is that every language worthy of the name should be in state of perennial ﬂux ready and avid to assimilate new elements and be battered about we ourselves are is there anything more charming than thoroughly defective verb fresh particles creeping into its vocabulary from all quarters while others are silently discarded there is bar on the escutcheon of many noble term and if in an access of formalism we refuse hospitality to some item of questionable repute our descendants may be deprived of linguistic jewel is the calamity worth risking when time and time alone can

fossil to be locked up in cabinet but living thing liable to the fate of all such things glance back into chaucer and note how they have thriven on their own merits and not on professorial recommendations thriven or perished or put on new faces i would make an exception to this rule foreign importations which not belong to us by right idioms we have enticed from over the sea one reason

remarkable and gruesome the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https old peruvians like the egyptians had necrophilous leanings they cultivated an unwholesome passion corpses and

practised among the inhabitants of the crimea 26 it adds considerably to their ghastly appearance one looks at them and asks oneself what are they now these gentle incas who loved the arts and music

antidote to mummiﬁed incas alatri what brought to alatri memories of conversation by tiber banks with fausto who was born here and vaunted it to be the fairest city on earth rome was quite passable place but to alatri you never saw such walls in all your life they are not walls they are precipices and our water is colder than the acqua marcia walls and water say little to but if the town produces other citizens like yourself it does indeed i am the least of the sons of alatri then it must be worthy of visit in the hottest hour of the afternoon they deposited outside the city gate at some new hotel i get its name to which i promptly took an unreasoning dislike there was ﬁne view upon the mountains from the window of the room assigned to but nothing could atone that lack of individuality which seemed to exhale from the establishment and its proprietors it looked though i were to be cypher here half an hour was much i could endure issuing forth despite the heat i captured young fellow and bade him carry my bags whithersoever he pleased he took to the alber go della the alber go della is shy and retiring hostelry invisible such to the naked eye since it bears sign of being place of public entertainment at all here was individuality and to spare mine host is an improvement even upon him of the pergola at valmontone man after my own heart with merry eyes drooping white moustache and lordly nose nose of the right kind structure which must have cost years of patient labour to bring to its present state of blossoming that nose i felt though i could dwell ever beneath its shadow the fare however is not up to the standard of the garibaldi inn at frosinone which i have just left now frosinone is tourist resort it is rather dull little place i am never likely to go there again and have therefore reason keeping to myself its garibaldi hotel which leaves little to be desired even under these distressful it set thinking thinking that there are not many townlets of this size in rural england which can boast of inns comparable to the garibaldi in point of cleanliness polite attention varied and good food reasonable prices not many perhaps very few one remembers fair number of the other kind however that kind where the fare is monotonous and badly cooked the attendance supercilious or inefﬁcient and where you have to walk across cold room at night reﬁnement of torture in order to turn out the electric light ere going to bed that infamy is alone enough to condemn these establishments one and all yes and the beds those frowsy creaky prehistoric wooden concerns always six or eight inches too short whose mattresses have not been turned the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https they were made what happens you clamber into

surrounded by white walls and attached to the convent on the neighbouring hill is pleasant spot to while away the afternoon hours you can have it to yourself i have all alatri to myself state of affairs which is not without its disadvantages being the only foreigner here one is naturally watched and regarded with suspicion and it would be even worse in less civilised places where one could count certain on trouble with some conscientious ofﬁcial so one remains on the beaten track although my reputation here nobody bothers about the germans is fairly well established since that memorable debate in the local cafe with bootmaker who having spent three years in america testiﬁed publicly that i spoke english almost well he did the little newsboy of the place who is universal favourite seeing that his father lithographer is serving stif f sentence gery he brings every day with the morning paper the latest gossip concerning myself still says you are spy it is sheer malice i know did you tell him he might i did he was very angry i also told him the remark you made about his mother tell him again it seldom pays to be rude it never pays to be only half rude in october and we are now at midsummer there occurred little adventure which shows the risks one may run at time like this i was in rome walking homewards at about eleven at night along the still crowded corso and thinking i went along of my impending journey northwards which the passport was already viséd when there met ﬂorid individual accompanied by two military ofﬁcers we stared at one another his face was familiar to though i knew not where i had seen it then he introduced himself he was director of the banca and was i not the gentleman who had recently been to orvinio i remembered the last time i was there i said was about month ago i fancy we had some conversation in the motor up from mandela that is so and now however disagreeable it may be i feel myself obliged to perform patriotic duty this is war i would ask you to be so good to accompany us to the nearest which is not far of f i replied there is one up the next street on our right the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https walked there all four of us without saying another word what have i been doing i wondered then we climbed upstairs here at table in rather stuf fy room sat delegato or commissario i get which surrounded despite the lateness of the hour by one or two subordinates he was of middle age and not prepossessing he looked if he could make himself unpleasant though his face was not of that actively vicious or actively stupid the terms are interconvertible kind while scanning his countenance during those few moments sundry thoughts ﬂitted through my mind these then i said to myself these are the functionaries whether executive or administrative whether italian or english or chinese whom man is supposed to respect who are they god knows of them are in place where they have business to be so much is certain and what are they doing these swarms of parasites justifying their salaries by inventing fresh regulations and meddlesome and making themselves objectionable all round distrust of authority should be the ﬁrst civic duty even the ﬁrst military duty is said to be the reverse of it we catch ourselves talking of the lesson of history why not take that lesson to heart reverence of the mandarin destroyed the fair life of old china which was overturned by the tartars not because chinamen were too weak or depraved but because they were the opposite too moral too too strong in their sense of right they paid their virtue with the extinction of their wonderful culture they ought to have known better they ought to have rated morality at its true worth since it was the profoundest chinaman himself who said that virtue is merely etiquette or something to that ef fect i found myself studying the delegato physiognomy what could one with such composite face it is question which often confronts when i see such types it confronted then in ﬂash how make it more presentable more imposing by what alterations shaving that moustache his countenance could not carry the loss it would forfeit what little air of dignity it possessed small pointed beard an possibly another trimming of the hair might have improved him but on the whole it was face difﬁcult to manipulate on account of its inherent insipidity and features one of those faces which give so much trouble to the barbers and valets of european royalties he took down the names and addresses of all four of us and it was then that i missed my chance i ought to have spoken ﬁrst instead of allowing this luscious director to begin follows the foreign gentleman here was at orvinio about month ago he admits it himself and i can corroborate the fact i was there at the same time orvinio is small country place in the corner of umbria there is mountain in the neighbourhood remote and very high altissima it is called mount muretta and occupies commanding situation reasons which i will leave you signer commissario to investigate this gentleman climbed up that mountain and was observed on the very summit making calculations and taking measurements with instruments now why did i climb up that wretched muretta an reason it was mountain there is eminence in the land from etna and the gran sasso downwards whose appeal i can resist bare patch on the summit whence presumably the name visible from below and promising lively scramble up the rock was an additional inducement precipices are not so frequent at orvinio that one can af ford to pass them by although this the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https matter of fact proved to be mighty tame af fair there was yet another object to my trip i desired to verify legend connected with this mountain the tradition of vanished castle or hamlet in its upper regions to whose former existence the name of certain old family still surviving at orvinio bears witness w are not really from orvinio these people will tell you we are from the lost castle of the muretta there is not vestige of castle left but i found one brick in the jungle which covers on the further side of the summit vast dating i should say from early mediaeval days under whose ruins the fastness may lie buried reasons enough visiting muretta to taking measurements well man is naturally accused of good many things in the course of half century nobody has yet gone so far to call mathematician these calculations and instruments were local mirage pretty an instance of the mythopoeic faculty one could hope to ﬁnd in our degenerate days when gods longer walk the earth 27 the ofﬁcial seemed to be impressed with the fact that my accuser was director of bank he inquired what i had to say this was puzzle they had sprung the thing on rather suddenly one likes to have notice of such questions tell the truth i am often tempted to so it saves so much trouble but is matter of longitude and the further east one goes the more one learns to hold in check that unnatural propensity mankind has natural love of the lie itself bacon which means nothing more than that one will well to take account of national psychology an english functionary athlete or mountaineer might have glimpsed the state of af fairs but to climb in war without any object save that of exercising one limbs and verifying questionable legend high and remote mountain muretta happens to be neither the one nor the other would have seemed to an italian an incredible proceeding i thought it better to assume the role of accuser in my turn an oriental trick this director i said calls himself patriot what has he told us that while at orvinio he knew foreigner who climbed high mountain to make calculations with instruments what does this admirable citizen with regard to such suspicious character he does nothing is there not of carbineers at the entrance of the place ready to arrest such people but our patriotic gentleman allows the spy to walk away to climb ﬁfty other mountains and take ﬁve thousand other measurements all of which have by this time safely reached berlin and vienna that signor commissario is not our english notion of patriotism i shall certainly make it my business to write and congratulate the banca on possessing such good italian director i shall also suggest that his talents would be more worthily employed at the banca naming notoriously establishment poor speech but it gave the satisfaction of seeing the fellow grow purple with fury and so picturesquely indignant that he soon reached the spluttering stage in fact there was nothing to be done with him the delegato suggested that inasmuch he had said his say and deposited his address he was at liberty to depart whenever so disposed they went he and his friends the other was looking serious serious such face could be made to look he must not be allowed to think i decided once an ofﬁcial begins to think he is liable to grow conscientious and then why any disaster might happen the least of them being that i should remain in custody the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https in how many more countries was i going to be arrested one crime or another this joke had lost its novelty good many years ago pernicious person i began you have but to look at him and now he has invited here in order to make patriotic impression on his friends those poor little devils in uniform safe remark since love is lost hereabouts between police and military such silly talk about measurements it should be nipped in the bud here you have an intelligent young subordinate if i mistake not let him drive home with at my expense we will go through all papers and search instruments and bring everything that savours of suspicion back to this ofﬁce together with my passport which i never carry on my person this meanwhile is my carta di soggiorno the document was in order still he hesitated i thought of those miserable three days grace which were all that the french consulate had accorded if the man grew conscientious i might remain stranded in rome and all that passport trouble must begin again and to tell him of this dilemma would make him more distrustful than ever i went on hastily to admit that my request might not be regular but how natural were we not allies was it not my duty to clear myself of such an imputation at the earliest moment and to spare ef forts to that end i felt sure he could sympathise with the state of my mind etc etc thus i spoke while perfect innocence mother of invention lent wings to my words and while thinking all the time you little vermin what are you doing here in that chair when you should be delving the earth or breaking stones beﬁts your kind i tried to picture myself climbing up muretta with theodolite bulging out of my pocket ﬂagon of port would have been more in my line calculations it is all i can to control my weekly washing bill and even that simple operation i like to have quiet half hour in room by myself instruments if this young fellow i thought discovers so much an astrolabe among my belongings let them hang from the ramparts at daybreak and the delegato listening was ﬁnally moved by my rhetoric they often are if you can throw not only your whole soul but good part of your body into the performance he found the idea sufﬁciently reasonable the subordinate might have been expected had nothing whatever to like all of his kind he was only in that ofﬁce to evade military service we drove away and on reaching our destination i insisted despite his polite remonstrances on turning everything upside down we made hay of the apartment but discovered nothing more treasonable than some rather dry biscuits and bottle of indif ferent marsala and now i must really be going he said one he will be surprised at my long absence i am coming with you i promised him the passport dream of it you will have trouble with him you can bring the passport but he will not look at it yes ten or eleven or midday so it happened the passport was waived aside by the ofﬁcial little detail which i must say struck more remarkable than anything else he did not even unfold it stato un equivoco was all he condescended to say still without smile there had been the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https incident was closed things might have gone dif ferently in the country i would either have been marched to the capital under the escort of regiment of carbineers or kept conﬁned in some rural barracks half century while the authorities were making the necessary researches into the civil status of my grandmother favourite poet an inquiry without which latin dossier is complete postscript why are there so many carbineers at orvinio and how many of these myriad public guardians scattered all over the country ever come into contact with criminal or even have the luck to witness street accident and would the taxpayer not proﬁt by reduction in their numbers and whether legal proceedings of every kind would not tend to diminish there is village of about three hundred inhabitants not far from rome ﬁfteen carbineers are quartered there before they came those inevitable little troubles were settled by the local mayor things remained in the family so to speak now the place has been set by the ears and tone of exacerbation prevails the natives spend their days in rushing to rome and back on business connected with not quarter of which would have arisen but the existence of the carbineers let not be misunderstood individually these men are nowise at fault they desire nothing better than to be left in peace seldom they meddle with local concerns far from it they live in sacerdotal isolation austerely aloof from the populace like colony of monks the institution is to blame it is their duty among other things to take down any char ge which anybody may care to prefer against his neighbour that done the machinery of the law is automatically set in motion five minutes talk among the village elders would have settled many af fairs which now degenerate into legal squabbles of twice many years chronic family feuds are fostered man who on reﬂection would ﬁnd it more proﬁtable to come to terms with his opponent over glass of wine or even to square the old syndic with couple of hundred francs sees himself obliged to try the same tactics on judge of the high court which calls dif ferent technique altogether the country is ﬂagrantly over 28 it gives one queer sense of public security to see at rome instance every third man you meet an ofﬁcial of course of some kind with revolver strapped to his belt if we were still trembling on the ver ge of savagery in some cowboy settlement out west greek towns of about ten thousand inhabitants like argos or megara have about ten municipal guardians each and peace reigns within their walls how can ten men perform duties which in italy would require ten times many is it question of climate or national character question perhaps of common sense of realising that local institutions often work with less friction and less outlay than that system of governmental centralisation of which the carbineers are an example meanwhile we are still at alatri which i am glad to discover possesses ﬁve gateways ﬁve or even more it is something of relief to be away from that roman tradition of four military reasons originally ﬁxing themselves at last into kind of sacred tradition so it is with unimaginative races their pious sentimentalism crystallises into inanimate objects the english dump down gothic piles on india coral strand and the chimes of big ben ﬂoating above that crowd of orientals give to the white man sense of homeliness and racial solidarity the french more ﬂuid and sensitive to the incongruous have introduced local colour into some of their colonial buildings not without success to this particular roman tradition the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https one with meaningless iteration from the burning sands of africa to ultima thule always those four gateways short after ramble nothing is comparable to that green space on the summit of the citadel hither i wend my way every morning to take my ﬁll of the panorama and meditate upon the vanity of human wishes the less you have seen of localities like tiryns the more you will be amazed at this impressive and mysterious fastness that portal those blocks what titans ﬁtted them into their places well we have now learnt little something about those titans and their methods from this point you can see the old roman road that led into alatri it climbs up the hill in straightforward fashion intersecting the broad modern v ia romana nowadays these alatri remains are wonderful more so than many of the sites which old ramage so diligently explored why did he fail to satisfy his curiosity in regard to them he utters not word about alatri yet he stayed at the neighbouring frosinone and makes some good observations about the place he stayed at the neighbouring ferentino and does the same was he more pressed time than usual we certainly ﬁnd him hurrying down past anagni near of whose imposing citadel he again says nothing whatever i am now at the end of several months beginning to know ramage fairly well i hope to know him still better ere we part company if ever we it takes time this interpretation this process of grafting one mind upon another he does not supply mere information ﬁg information that would be easy to digest he supplies character which is tougher fare his book unassuming it is comes up to my test of what such literature should be it reveals personality it contains philosophy of life and what is the dominating trait of this old scotsman the historical sense ancient inscriptions interested him more than anything else he copied many of them during his trip ﬁfty i should think and it is small labour any one who has tried it can testify to decipher these records often placed in the most inconvenient situations he seems to have taken squeezes to have busied himself thus was to his credit in an age whose chief concern regards antiquity consisted in plundering works of art ornamental purposes ramage did not collect like other travellers he collected knowledge of humanity and its institutions such knowledge inscriptions reveal it is good to hear him discoursing upon these documents in stone these genealogies of the past with pleasingly sentimental erudition he likes them not in any fashion but the light they throw upon the living world of his day speaking of one of them he says it is when we come across names connected with men who have acted an illustrious part in the world history that the fatigues of such journey i have undertaken are felt to be completely repaid that is the humanist spirit his equipment in the interpretation of these stones and of all else he picked up in the way of lore and legend was of the proper kind boundless curiosity ﬁrst of all and then an adequate apparatus of learning he knew his classics knew them so well that he could always put his ﬁnger on those particular passages of theirs which bore upon point of interest we may doubtless be able to supply some apt quotation from virgil or martial it is quite dif ferent thing remembering and collating references in aelian or pliny or aristotle or ptolemy and wide awake withal not easily imposed upon he is not of the kind to swallow the tales of the then fashionable cicerone he has critical dissertations on sites like cannae and the bandusian fountain and caudine forks and when at nola they opened in his presence sepulchre containing some of those painted greek vases which the place is famous he the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https it to be sepulchre prepared strangers and instead of buying the vases allows them to remain where they are more simple or less suspicious travellers on the way to cape leuca he passes certain mounds whose origin he believes to be artiﬁcial and the work of prehistoric race i fancy his conjecture has proved correct on page 258 speaking of an oscan inscription he mentions mommsen which shows that he kept himself up to date in such researches of course it would be impossible to feel any real fondness ramage before one has discovered his failings and his limitations well he seems to have taken pratilli seriously i like this young fellow who in 1828 could have guessed pratilli to have been the ger he was such young fellow would be freak of learning he says little of the great writers of his age that too is weakness of youth whose imagination lingers willingly in the past or future but not in the present the hohenstauf fen period does not attract him he rides close to the magniﬁcent castel del monte but fails to visit the site he inspects the castle of lucera and says never word about frederick ii or his saracens at lecce renowned its baroque buildings he ﬁnds nothing to interest stranger except perhaps the church of santa croce which is not bad specimen of architectural design true the beauty of baroque had not been discovered in his day what pleases less is that there occurs hardly any mention of wild animals in these pages and that he seems to enjoy natural scenery in proportion it reminds him of some passage in one of those poets whom he is so fond of quoting this love of poetic extracts and citations is mark of his period it must have got the upper hand of him in course of time we ﬁnd from the of these nooks and byways that he was the author of beautiful thoughts from greek authors beautiful thoughts from french and italian authors etc 29 indeed the publication of this particular book late 1868 seems to have been an afterthought how greatly one would prefer few more nooks and to all these beautiful thoughts he must have been at home again in some bleak caledonian retreat when the poetic ﬂowers were gathered if only he had lingered longer among the classic remains of the south instead of rushing through them like an express train that mania of pressing forward that fatal gift of hustle his body ﬂits hither and thither but his mind remains observant assimilative it is only on reading this book carefully that one realises how full of information it is ay he notices things does ramage things well he always has time to look around him it is his charm an intelligent interest in the facts of daily life should be one of the equipments of the touring scholar seeing that the present af fords key to the past ramage has that gift and his zest never degenerates into the fussiness of many modern travellers he can talk of sausages and silkworms and forestry and agriculture and and how they catch porcupines and cure warts and manufacture manna he knows about the evil eye and witches and the fata morgana and the tarantula spider about ﬁgs in ancient and modern times and the bird that bird you eat bones and all the focetola or beccaﬁco garden warbler in fact he has multifarious interests and seems to have known several languages besides the classics he can hit of f thing neatly when contrasting our sepulchral epitaphs with those of olden days he says that the of ours is hope and of theirs peace or wherever we ﬁnd river in this country calabria we are sure to discover that it is source of danger and not of proﬁt he knew these southern torrents and river he garners information about the jewish and albanian colonies of south italy he studies romaic under one of the few greeks who survived the fatal siege of missolonghi and collects words of greek speech still surviving at bova the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https maratea by the way has phoenician smack the greeks must have arrived later on the scene they did at marathon itself shrewd book indeed like many of his countrymen he was specially bent on economic and social questions he is driven to the prophetic conclusion in 1828 that the government rests on very insecure basis and the great mass of the intelligence of the country would gladly welcome change religion and schooling are subjects near his heart and in order to obtain knowledge of these things in italy he enters upon friendship kind of intellectual ﬂirtation with the jesuits that is it should be extremes can always respect one another the jesuits i doubt not learnt much from ramage he from them i wish i had encountered this book earlier it would have been useful to when writing my own pages on the country it describes i am always ﬁnding myself in accord with the author opinions even in trivial matters such the hopeless inadequacy of an italian breakfast he was personally acquainted with several men whose names i have mentioned capialbi zicari masci he saw the purple codex at rossano in fact there are numberless points on which i could have quoted him with proﬁt and even at an earlier time i once claimed to have discovered the ruins of roman palace on the lar ger of the siren islets the galli opposite positano now i ﬁnd him forestalling by nearly century it is often thus with archaeological discoveries he saw near cotrone that island of the enchantress calypso which has disappeared since his day and would have sailed there but the fact that boat was procurable i get whether swinburne who landed here found any prehistoric remains on the spot i should doubt it on another mediterranean island that of ponza i myself detected the relics of what would formerly have been described the residence of that second homeric witch circe 30 the mention of discoveries reminds that i have already of course discovered my ideal family at alatri two ideal families one of them dwells in what ought to be called the conca that luxuriant tract of land beyond the monastery where the waters ﬂow that verdant dale which supplies alatri perched on its stony hill with fruit and vegetables of every kind the man is with wife and children humble serf steeped in the rich philosophy of earth and cloud and sunshine i bring him cigar in the cool of the evening and we smoke on the threshold of his abode or wander about those tiny patches of culture geometrically disposed where he guides the water with cunning hand athwart the roots of cabbages and salads he is not prone to talk of his misfortunes intuitive civility has taught him to avoid troubling stranger with personal concerns the mother is more communicative she suf fers more acutely they are hopelessly poor she tells and in debt unlucky moreover in their offspring two boys had already died there are only two left and this one here is in bad way he has grown too ill to work he can only mope about the place nothing stays in his stomach nothing not milk not an egg everything is rejected the alatri doctor treated him stomach trouble so did he of frosinone it has done good now there is more money doctors it is hard to see your children dying before your eyes look at him just like those two others i looked at the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https you sent him into the plains last summer i ventured to cisterna one must make little money or starve and you expect to keep your children alive if you send them to cisterna i was astonished that the local medicine man had not diagnosed malaria i undertook that if she would put him into the train when next i went to rome i would have him overhauled by competent physician and packed home again with written instructions i kept my word and the good doctor salatino of the via torino calabrian who knows something about malaria wrote out treatment this neglected case part of which i fear has been observed such is the fatalism of the that if drugs and injections not work like magic they are quietly discarded this youth may well have gone the way of those other two who by the by were also sent into the pontine marshes since you can not reject your food ever and grow more anaemic every day without producing some such result meanwhile my friendly of fer caused so great joy in the mother heart that i became quite embarrassed she likened among other things to her favourite saint all comparisons being odious i turned the conversation by asking and that last one here she said pushing open the door of the inner room he lay on the couch fast asleep in glorious tangle of limbs the picture of radiant boyhood this one i think has never been to cisterna he goes into the mountains with the woodcutters every morning an hour before sunrise it is up beyond collepardo seven hours labour and seven hours march there and back the rest of the time he sleeps like log children from these often accompany their parents into the plains to work more commonly they go in droves of any number under the char ge of some local man they are part of that immense army of hirelings which descends annually from the uplands of tuscany to the very toe of italy into these regions hardly an inch of which is fever i not know even approximately the numbers of these migratory swarms of all ages and both sexes let us say to be on the safe side quarter of million they herd down there in the broiling heat of summer and autumn under conditions which are not all that could be desired 31 were they housed in marble palaces and served on platters of gold the risk would not be diminished by hair how many return infected i have idea it can not be less than sixty per cent how many of these perish perhaps ﬁve per cent few thousand annual deaths are not worth talking about what concerns the country and what the country indeed has taken seriously in hand is this impoverishment of its best blood this devitalising action of malaria upon unnumbered multitudes of healthy men women and children who not altogether succumb to its attacks i sometimes recognise them on the platform of rome station family parties whom i have met in their country villages now bound maccarese or one of those infernal holes in the campagna there to earn little extra money with hay or maize or wheat or tomatoes or whatever the particular crop the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https you chat with the parents the youngsters run up to you all gleeful with the change of scene and the joy of travelling by railway i know what they will look like when they return to their mountains later on and so discoursing of this and that one rambles oneself into book into half book here at alatri and now midsummer i mean to terminate these memories and leave unrecorded the less insigniﬁcant events which followed up to the mornings in october those mornings when jackdaws came cawing past my window from the thickly couched mists of the bor ghese gardens and the matutinal tub began to feel more chilly than was altogether pleasant half book i perceive it clearly these pages might be rounded by another hundred or two the design is too lar ge one volume it reminds of those tweed suits we used to buy long ago whose pattern was so loud that it took two men to show it of which proves how few months beguilement by the wayside of beaten track can become the subject of disquisitions without end maybe the very aimlessness of such loiterings conduces to like method of narrative maybe the tone of the time fosters reminiscential and intimately personal mood by driving man refuge into the only place where peace can still be found into himself what is the use of appealing in objective fashion to the intelligence of world gone crazy say your say go your way let them rave we shall all be again morrow 32 half book it strikes on reﬂection curiously appropriate

he catches himself saying he reads the morning paper full of fetishism and sanguinary nonsense one beethoven symphony is greater victory than the greatest of these and reasonable folks may live under

back upon these months of uneventful wanderings i became aware of singular phenomenon i ﬁnd myself some obscure reason always returning to the same spot i was nine times in rome twice in florence and viareggio and olevano and anticoli and alatri and licenza and soriano ﬁve times at valmontone thrice at orvinio and if i did not go second time to scanno and other places there may be reason it why this perpetual revisiting how many new and interesting sites might have been explored during that period adventures and discoveries might have fallen to my lot and been duly noted down it is nothing happened and nothing was noted down i have only diary of dates to go upon out of which with the help of memory and imagination have been extracted these pages generally delving down into memory man can bring up at least one clear fragment something still fervid and ﬂashing remembered voice or glimpse of landscape which helps to unveil the main features of scenario already relegated to the lumber and this detail will unravel the next the scattered elements jostle each other into place in the ﬁnal disentangling of some complicated fugue such things will skeleton imagination will kindly provide ﬂesh and blood life movement imagination why not one suppresses much why not add little truth blends well with untruth and phantasy has been so sternly banned of late from travellers tales that i am growing tender towards the poor old dame quite chivalrous in fact especially on those rather frequent occasions when i ﬁnd myself unable to dispense with her services yes truth blends well with untruth it is one of the maladies of our age sign of sheer nervousness to profess frenzied allegiance to truth in unimportant matters to refuse consistently to face her where graver issues are at stake we can not lay claim to truthful state of mind in this respect the eighteenth century all its foppery was ahead of ours what is the basic note of horace walpole iridescent worldliness what about veracity how one yearns nowadays that spacious and playful outlook of his or better still some altogether golden age where everybody is corrupt and delightful and has nothing whatever to and does it well my second ideal family at alatri lives along side path which diver ges of f the main road to ferentino they are peasant proprietors more wealthy and civilised than those others but lacking their terrestrial pathos they live among their own vines and on the hillside the female parent massive matron would certainly never send those winsome children into the pontine marshes not single day not their weight in gold the father is quite an uncommon creature i look at him and ask myself where have i seen that face before so classic and sinewy and versatile i have seen it on greek vases and among the sailors of the cyclades and on the bosphorus it is face with sparkling eyes brown hair rounded forehead and crisply curling beard legendary face how came odysseus to alatri not far from this homestead where i have spent sundry pleasant hours there is fountain gushing out of hollow in olden days it would have been hung with votive of ferings to the nymphs and rightly one appreciates this cult in dry land i have worshipped at many such shrines where the water bounds forth living joy out of the rocky cleft unlike those sluggish springs of the north that ooze regretfully upwards though ready to slink home again unless they were kicked from behind and then trickle along with barely perceptible movement amid weeds and slime now this particular fountain i think it is called acqua santa while nowise remarkable regards natural beauty is renowned curing every disease the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https not an ordinary rill it has medicinal properties hither those two little demons the younger children conducted all unsuspecting two days ago desirous that i should taste the far spring try it they said i refused at ﬁrst since water of every kind has knack of disagreeing with my weak digestion them they gulped down tumblers of it being manifestly inured to what i afterwards discovered to be its catastrophic effects look at us drinking it they went on ah how good delicious it is like fiuggi only better am i an invalid to drink fiuggi water it is not quite the same fiuggi t rue i was soon wishing it had been how many men would pay dearly your privilege never let it be said that you went away thirsting from this blessed spot i am not thirsty just now not at all thirsty thank you we have seen you drink without being thirsty just one glass they pleaded it will make you live hundred years let us talk about something else then what shall we tell our mother that we brought you here and that you were afraid of little mouthful of acqua santa we thought you had more courage we thought you could strangle lion something will happen i said i drained that glass nothing happened few hours two days rest is working wonders i proﬁt by the occasion of this slight indisposition to glance backwards and forwards i am here at alatri on the 22 june so much is beyond contestation later page of that old diary of dates august 31 palombara well i remember the hot walk to palombara august 3 mons lucretilis that classical mountain from whose summit i gazed at the distant velino which overtops like crystal of amethyst all the other peaks this was during one of my two visits to licenza pleasant days at licenza duly noting in the house of horace what i have noted with shelley and other bards namely that these fellows who sing so blithely of the simple life yet contrive to possess extremely commodious residences pleasant days among those wooded glens walking almost every morning in the footsteps of old ramage up the valley in whose streamlet the sway like branches of coral aloft under the wild walnuts to that bubbling fountain where i used to meet my two friends arcadian aboriginal fauns of the thickets who told amid ribald laughter few personal experiences which nothing would induce to set down here july 26 la rocca what happened at la rocca the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https 2 florence what happened at florence good deal during those noteworthy twelve hours some memories have grown strangely nebulous impossible to reconstruct example what went on during the days of drowsy discomfort at montecelio lethar gy seems to have fallen on i lived in dream out of which there emer ges nothing save the ﬁgure of the local tobacconist ruddy type with the face of roman farmer who took to booze with him in broad patriarchal style every night at dif ferent friend house those nights at montecelio the mosquitoes the heat could this be the place which was famous in pliny day its grove of beeches how i used to envy the old montecelians their climate july 23 saracinesca what happened i recollect the view over the sweltering campagna from the dizzy in whose garden i see myself nibbling black cherry the very last of the season plucked from tree which grows beside the wall whereon i sat that sufﬁces it gives key to the situation i can now conjure up the gaunt and sombre houses of this stronghold the rembrandtesque shadows the streets devoid of men the picture of some martial hero in recess where i sought shelter from the heat black cruciﬁx planted in the soil below the entrance of the village my picture of saracinesca is complete in outline july 31 subiaco precisely week later then i walk chilometres along the shadeless high road an insane thing to to subiaco and back there in the restaurant aniene when all the have departed their noonday nap the cook of the establishment one of those glorious old roman comes up to my table did i like the boiled trout rather ﬂabby i reply little tasteless let him try next time some white vinegar in the water and or two he pricks up his ears we are gens du metier i invite him to sit down and inquire how about bottle of cesanese now that we are alone an excellent idea and he in his turn will permit himself to of fer certain strawberries from his own private store strawberries i ask who ever heard of strawberries in central italy on the 31 july why i devoured the last cherry week ago and it was only alive because it grew above the clouds these he explains mysteriously are special strawberries brought down from near the by special they are not the guests but only myself strawberries are always worth paying they are mildly purging they go well with the wine and what wonderful scent they have you remind of certain lucullo i said who was also nice about strawberries in fact he made ﬁne art of eating and drinking your lucullo we may take it was roman romano di roma thus conversing with this rare old rufﬁan i get my intention of leaving card on saint scolastica she has waited so long she can wait little longer august 9 villa lante august 12 ferento what happened at ferento the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https what happened at ferento let try to reconstruct that morning visit i have clear memories of the walk from viterbo it would be eighteen chilometres there and back they told i had slept well in my quaint little room with the water rushing under the window and breakfasted in receptive and responsive mood i recall that trudge along the highway and how i stepped across patches of sunlight from the shade of one regularly planted tree into that of another the twelfth of august it set thinking of heathery moorlands and grouse and of those legions of ﬂies that settle on one nose just one pulls the trigger it all seemed dim and distant here on this parching road among southern ﬁelds i was beginning to be lost in muse to what these boreal ﬂies might with themselves during the long winter months while all the old women of the place are knitting shetland underwear when suddenly little tune came into my ears wistful intermezzo of brahms it seemed to spring out of the hot earth such natural song elvishly coaxing would i ever play it again neither that nor any other it turned my thoughts i went along to brahms and led to understand why man who cares only his will ever relish that music it is an alien tongue full of deeps and rippling shallows uncomprehended of those who know nothing of lonely places full of thrills and silences such are not encountered among the habitations of men it echoes the multitudinous voice of nature and distils the smiles and tears of things this man listened all alone he overheard things to which other ears are deaf things terrible and sweet the sigh of some wet naiad by reedy lake the pleadings and furies of the genii of those that whisper in woodlands and caverns by the sea and ride wailing on thunder clouds and rock with ripe laughter in sunny wildernesses brahms is the test whoso dreads solitude will likewise dread his elemental humour it kept company this melodious and endearing fairy till where path diver ging to the right led up to the ruins already visible there the ethereal comrade took ﬂight scared maybe because my senses took on grossly mundane complexion it is way they have thank god became absorbed that is in the contemplation of certain blackberries wherewith the hedge was loaded i thought the tons of blackberries that fall to earth in italy unheeded and not even scotsman knows what blackberries are until he has tasted these i am gourmet of such wild things i rather agree with goethe when he says how berries taste you must ask children but i can sympathise with the predilections of others having certain predilections of my own once at miserable place in north ireland region of bad whisky and porter they brought at dinner some wine of which they knew nothing they had got it from shipwreck or some local sale i am rather fond of hock and this particular bottle bore on its label the magic imprint of falcon sitting on hilltop connoisseurs will know that falcon they will understand how it came about that i remained in the inn till the last bottle of nectar was cracked what shame to leave drop anybody else once again on bicycle trip from paris to the mediterranean i came upon broad smiling meadow somewhere in the auver gne thickly besprinkled with mushrooms there was village hard by in that village i remained till the meadow was close cropped half ton of mushrooms gone some people are rather fond of mushrooms and that is the right spirit to leave nothing but tabula rasa those that come after it hurt to think that anybody else should have single one of those particular mushrooms let them ﬁnd new ones in another ﬁeld not in mine now what would your amateur of blackberries in italy from the fate which nearly overtook he might save himself by specialising by the project gutenberg ebook of alone by norman douglas https many local varieties into two main classes and devoting his whole attention to one or the other to the kind such i found on elba small and round and fragrant of ruddy hue and palpitating with warm sunbeams or to that other kind those that grow in clearings of the apennines where the boughs droop to earth with the weight of their portentous clusters swarthy night huge in size oval and fraught with chilly mountain dews true enthusiast i feel sure would ever be satisﬁed with such an unfair division of labour so an arrangement he would curse his folly having specialised while engaged upon one variety he would always be hankering after that other kind and thinking how much better they were what shall he then well he might devote one year to one species the next to another and so on or else seeing that every zone of altitude bears brambles at its season and that the interval between the maturing of the extreme varieties is at least four months he might pilgrimage athwart the country in vertical sense devouring blackberries of dif ferent ﬂavour he went along he might work his way upwards boring tunnel through the landscape beetle drills an oak and leaving track of devastation in his rear browsing aloft from the where brambles are black in june through tangled macchia and slopes into the cooler acclivities of rock and jungle grazing ever upward to where at close of september and in the shadow of some lonely peak on which the white mantle of winter has already fallen he ﬁnds few more berries struggling warmth and sunshine and then still higher up just few more the last the very last of their race dwarfs of the mountains and frozen pink ere yet they have had time to ripen here crammed to the brim he may retire to hibernate curled up like ged bear and ready to roll downhill with the melting snows and arrive at the in time to begin again what jolly life how much better than being postmaster or inspector of nuisances but such enthusiasts are nowhere to be found i wish they were the world would be merrier place here is the ruined town of ferento all alone on the arid brow of the hill nothing human in sight charming spot it must have been in olden times when the country was more timbered now all is bare brown earth brown stones dutifully i inspect the ruins and applying the method of zadig or something of that kind conclude that ferento this particular ferento was relatively unimportant and relatively modern although so ﬁne site may well have commended itself from early days settlement i pick up namely piece of verde antico green marble which came into vogue at later period than many other coloured ones er go ferento was relatively modern antiquities go else this marble would not occur there i seek coloured ones and ﬁnd not the smallest fragment nothing but white er go the place was relatively insigniﬁcant else the reds and yellows would also be discoverable i observe incidentally quite incidentally that the architecture corroborates my theory so the doubt if there are any now i know furthermore the origin of that small slab of verde antico which had puzzled mixed up it was among the mosaics of quite modern marbles in that church whither i had been conducted by local antiquarian to admire certain fresco recently laid bare and some rather crude daubs by romanelli out again into the path that overlooks the steep ravine here i ﬁnd resting in the shadow of the wall an aged shepherd and his ﬂock and shaggy dog of the campagna breed that shows his teeth and growls incessantly glaring at if i were wolf barone is the brute name i had intended to clamber down and see whether the bears any traces of human workmanship the i now decide may take care of

of yonder clump of withering thistles thistles of recent growth you could sit you could stand in their shade and found myself glancing over leaden lake and wandering about streets full of and

the ugliest creeper on earth infallible instinct zurich who shall sum up thy merciless vulgarity so this old man had been there and i remembered an expression in book recently written by friend of

in their mortal agony that it was deemed impious ever to unloosen that embrace so they were laid to rest locked in each other arms while my companion told these things we had plodded further and

absolutely afraid to ask any questions in the british museum they jump at an idea and cut the ground from under the original man feet this i regret to say is my experience i have been asked what does it matter who makes the discovery i reply unto caesar etc if you are going to work it out keep it dark the british museum have not the necessary specimens in this country i believe it is not known how the change takes place i tried some years ago to work it out with live specimens but failed because i could not get young birds now in answer to your question my belief is that the young bird moults

of prehistoric structure of the cyclopean type underneath corner of the cemetery wall there is portion in better preservation between the of pilate and the harbour where little path winds up from the sea the blocks are joined without mortar and some of them are over metre in length this megalithic wall may be taken to be contemporaneous with similar works of defence found in various parts of italy
