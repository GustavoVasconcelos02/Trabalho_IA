father note to use of appendix i have relegated to the appendix all notes of any considerable length the reader is advised to consult the appendices wherever directed in the footnotes he will then have much clearer conception of the principal characters and events of the poem introduction eowulf may rightly be pronounced the great national epic of the saxon race not that it exalts the race so much that it presents the spirit of the peoples the ideals and aims the manners and customs of our ancestors and that it does so in setting before us great national hero beowulf himself was not an saxon he was but he belonged to that confraternity of nations that composed the teutonic people he lived in an heroic age when the songs of the wandering singers were of the great deeds of outstanding men the absolute epic of the english people has yet to be written to some extent arthur though british is to say though he was king of the celtic british people who were subsequently driven into the west into cornwall and wales and strathclyde by our saxon nationalized by our norman ancestors typical king of the english people he has become the epic king of the english in the poetry of tennyson it is always mystery to the writer that competent singer among us has contents contents 7 contents 8 the story of beowulf https laid hands upon our own saxon hero king alfred it is sometimes said that there is nothing new under the sun that there is nothing left the modern singer to sing about and that the realm of possible musical production is fast vanishing out of view certainly this is not true of poetry both alfred and arthur are waiting the sympathetic voice that will tell forth to the world the immortal splendour of their personalities and just the idealized arthur of the english nation though he really fought against the english so the saxon singer of beowulf has idealized this geatish chieftain and in some way set him forth the idealized chieftain of the teutonic race beowulf is an poem consists of 3182 lines it is written in the alliterative verse of our ancestors in the tongue which though the mother of the english is yet more dif ficult to read the englishman than latin or greek one wonders whether any genuine epic existed and has been destroyed in the passing of the centuries the curious feature about this poem is that it concerns man who was not an our poem is written in the west saxon dialect the original poem was probably in northumbrian and was translated into west saxon during the period of literary ef florescence in the west saxon court we not know whether it was translation or whether it was original though the latter is i believe the prevailing opinion arnold has put forth what may be called the missionary theory of its origin he believes that both the choice of subject and the grade of culture may be connected with the missionary ef forts of the english church of those days to extend christianity in friesland and further east it does not seem improbable that it was in the interest of the spread of christianity that the composer of beowulf missioner perhaps layman attached to the attracted to the scandinavian lands that he resided there long enough to become thoroughly steeped in the and local traditions that he found the grand figure of beowulf the geat predominant in them and that weaving into an or ganic whole those which he found suitable to his own purpose he composed an epic which on his return home must soon have become known to all the lovers of english 1 sarrazin thought this unknown poet might have been the famous cynewulf arnold chiefly on stylistic grounds differs from this opinion this is arnold s opinion sagas either in the danish dialect or that of the probably the current in the scandinavian countries in the seventh century among these sagas that of beowulf the geat must have had prominent place others celebrated hygelac his uncle hnaef the viking the wars of the danes and the heathobards of the danes and the swedes about the end of the century missionaries from england are known to have been busy in friesland and denmark endeavouring to convert the natives to christianity some one of these whose mind had turn literature and dwelt with joy upon the traditions of the past collected or learnt by heart number of these sagas and taking that of beowulf basis and weaving some others into his work composed an epic poem to which although it contains the record of those adventures the heroic scale of the figure who accomplishes them all imparts real unifying epic whatever may be the truth to its origin there it lies in the british museum in its unique testimony to all ages of the genius of the race 9 10 11 12 the story of beowulf https it will be quite naturally asked what we learn from beowulf of the genius and spirit of that race from which we are sprung the one outstanding fact it appears to the writer is the principle and this principle stands in almost violent opposition to the ruling principle of the modern world in which society is divided into number of mutually opposite sections or classes whose interests clash with fatal results to individual and corporate in this poem we see the whole community from the king to the churl bound by one common interest king and chieftain and thane and churl freely intermingle and converse they eat and drink and sleep under one common roof or at least in one common enclosure tempora mutantur but the idea of social interaction and mutual interdependence never found more vivid or real expression than in the pictures presented in beowulf of hart the great hall of hrothgar and in the court and township of hygelac king of the geats in the hall of hart hrothgar and his queen and his courtiers sit at the high table on the dais and the lower orders at the long table down the hall the spears and shields adorn the walls after the evening meal the singer or scop he is called to the accompaniment of the harp tells forth the deeds of some ancient feud such that of finn and the danes or the fight at finnsbur gh or the feud of the danes and the heathobards in which freawaru hrothgar s daughter and ingeld figure so tragically then the benches are removed and the rude beds are spread out on the floor of the great hall and they seek evening the whole is picture of fraternal and paternal government if grendel the carries away one of their number then there is weeping and lamentation the king and the queen and the nobility and the commonalty are all concerned in the tragedy the loss of one is the loss of all when aeschere is slain by grendel s mother hrothgar thus bewails his loss seek more after joy sorrow is renewed the danish folk aeschere is dead he who was my wise counsellor and my adviser and my comrade in arms when in time of war we defended ourselves but now the hand lieth low which bestowed every kind of joy upon and in the end of the poem it is said of beowulf that he was most gentle to his the king was king only his the interest of his folk their physical and moral being was his chief solicitude but not only was this so within any one nation or tribe but there was sense of comradeship and mutual responsibility among those of various tribes and nations when beowulf the geat hears in gautland of the raids of grendel upon hart he commands his folk to make ready boat that he may fare across the sea to the help of hrothgar because he was lacking in beowulf s whole mission in hart was the dischar ge of solemn obligation of help from the strong to the weak he announces to hrothgar that he is come to cleanse hart of ill and this he feels he must w oe is if i preach not the gospel cried paul w oe is if i help not the weak and cleanse not the palace of my kinsman cried beowulf w eird goes he willeth that is fate must be submitted to and fate hath willed that he should help the weak and cleanse the then there is the tremendous sense of loyalty on the part of the folk to their king or chieftain the idea of the comitatus bound the folk to their leaders nothing more disgraceful could be conceived than the desertion 13 14 15 the story of beowulf https the leader terrible were the reproaches hurled at the trembling cowards who had hurried away into the woods to save their own skins whilst their king beowulf wrestled with the dragon the enemy of the people y ea death is better any earl than life of loyalty passionate loyalty to the king was the greatest of virtues and disloyalty and cowardice the greatest of vices society was an or ganic whole bound together by the bands of loyalty and devotion to the common good there is too the fatalistic note heard all through the poem beowulf feels himself hard pressed by fate the called fate by the name w eird which has survived in modern english in the sense of something strange and mysterious weird was the god or goddess of fate again and again in the poem we hear the solemn minor refrain w eird hath willed it goeth weird she willeth chapter vi 44 there is this perpetual overshadowing and almost crushing sense of some inscrutable and irresistible power that wieldeth all things and disposeth all things which is i believe characteristic of the race and accounts the courage of her sons upon the or on the high seas we find it too in its morally less attractive form in the recrudescent pessimism of modern literature thomas hardy is the lineal descendant in literature of the author of beowulf when he says thus the president of the immortals had finished his sport with poor 2 and closely allied to this sense of destiny is the sombre view of life that is characteristic of the teutonic peoples there is none of that passionate joy in beauty and in love that we find in the celtic literature life is serious thing in beowulf and with us of the race the scenery of beowulf is massive and threatening and angry seas are boiling and sur ging and breaking at the foot of lofty and precipitous clif fs above the edge of the clif fs stretch mysterious and gloomy moorlands and treacherous bogs and dense forests inhabited by malignant and powerful spirits the foes of humanity in land like this there is time eating drinking sleeping fighting there make up the business of life it is to the celtic inflow that we owe the addition of love in our modern literature the composer of beowulf could not have conceived the arthur saga or the tristram these things belong to later age when celtic and teutonic elements were fused in the race but we still find in our literature the sombre hues and after all it is in the forest of sorrow and pain that we discover the most beautiful flowers and the subtlest perfumes i desire to express my indebtedness to wyatt and william morris their translations to wyatt his edition of the poem in the original to thomas arnold his terse and most informing work on beowulf to the authors of articles in the encyclopaedia britannica and in chambers s encyclopaedia and the cambridge

companions may stand at his side helping their liege lord in all nations by praiseworthy deeds shall man be thriving at the fated hour scyld passed away very vigorous in spirit to the keeping of his

great wielding he broke not his promise but gave to them rings and treasures at the banquet the hall towered on high and the gables were wide between the horns 2 and awaited the sur ging of the loathsome flames not long time should pass ere hatred was awakened after the twixt father and then it was that the powerful sprite who abode in darkness scarce could brook while that daily he heard loud joy in the hall there was sound of harping and the clear song of the bard he who knew it was telling of the beginning of mankind and he said that the almighty created the world and the bright fields surrounded by water and exulting he set the sun and the moon lamps to shine upon the and adorned the world with branches and leaves and life he was giving to every kind of living creature so noble men lived in joy and were all blessed till one began to evil devil from hell and this grim spirit was called grendel and he was who ruled on the moorlands the fens and the stronghold while he kept guard this unhappy creature over the land of the race of monsters since the creator had proscribed him on the race of cain the eternal lord brought death vengeance when he slew abel nor did he find joy in the feud but god the crime drove him far thence thus it was that evil things came to their birth giants and elves and monsters of the deep likewise those giants who long while were striving with god himself and well he requited them ii hen he went visiting the high house after nightfall to see how the were holding it and he found there band of athelings asleep after feasting and

distress and sorrows that were great the time of twelve winters then was it made known to the children of men by sorrowful singing that grendel was striving this while against hrothgar and waged hateful enmity of crime and feud many year with lasting strife and would hold truce against any man of the main host of danes nor put away the or settle feud with fee nor did any man need to hope brighter bettering at the hand of the banesman the terrible monster dark was pursuing the youth and the warriors and he fettered and ensnared them and ever was holding night after night the misty

by means did he lament over his life the coat of mail which was ample and of many colours was destined to explore the deeps and knew well how to defend his body so that neither nor the hostile grasp of the treacherous one might scathe breast or life and the white helmet thereof warded his head that which was destined to search out the bottom of the sea and the welter of waters and which was adorned with treasures and encircled with noble chains wondrously decked and set round with boar images in days of yore had made it him so that brand nor could bite him and by means was that the least of aids in battle that the spokesman of hrothgar 35 lent him at need even the hilted sword which was called hrunting and it was one of the ancient treasures its edge was of iron and and hardened in

that it was to deeds of courage and unferth did not think he the kinsman of ecglaf crafty of strength of what he formerly had said 36 when drunken with wine he had lent that weapon to braver he himself durst not risk his life in the stress of the waters and glorious deed and thereby he lost his doom of famous deeds but thus was it not with that other he had got himself ready the battle xxii eowulf spake the son of ecgtheow kinsman of healfdene 37 thou far and proud prince thou of men now that eager i am this bethink thee now of what we two were speaking together that if i should lose my life through helping thee in thy need thou wouldst be always to in the place of father after my death be thou guardian to my kinsmen my thanes and my hand comrades if battle should take and dear hrothgar send thou the gifts which thou didst give to hygelac and the lord of the geats the son of hrethel when he looks on the treasure and perceives the gold will see that i found giver of rings one good and and that while i could i enjoyed the treasures and thou let unferth the man who is far have the old heirloom the curiously wrought sword with its device with its hard edge i work out my fate with hrunting or death shall seize after these words the lord of the courageously hastened and by means would he wait an answer the whelming sea received the and it was day s while before he could see the bottom of the sea and very soon the fierce and eager one who had ruled the expanse of the floods hundred years she the grim and greedy saw that man was searching out from above the dwelling of strange monsters then she made grab at him and closed on the warrior with dire embrace but not at first did she scathe his body safe and sound the ring surrounded it on the outside so that she could not pierce the coat of mail or the interlaced war with loathsome finger then the when she came to the bottom of the sea bore the towards her house so that he might not though he was so strong in soul wield any weapon and many wonder oppressed him in the depths many beast broke his war with his and monsters pursued him then the earl saw that he was in he knew not what hall of strife where water scathed him whit nor could the sudden grip of the flood touch him because of the he saw too firelight bright pale flame shining then the good man caught sight of the that monstrous wife down in the depths of the sea and he made mighty rush with his 97 contents 98 99 the story of beowulf https nor did his hand fail to swing it so that the ringed mail on her head sang greedy then beowulf the stranger discovered that the would not bite or scathe her life but the edge failed the lord in his need it had suf fered many and the helmet the of the doomed one it had often cut in two that was the first time that his dear failed him then he became resolute and not by any means did he fail in courage that kinsman of hygelac mindful of glory and this angry warrior threw away the stout sword bound round with jewels with its wavy decorations and with its edge of steel so that it lay prone on the ground and henceforth he trusted in his strength and the of might so should man be doing when he thinketh to be gaining praise in fighting and careth not his life then the lord of the geats seized by the shoulder the mother of grendel nor at all did he mourn over that feud and he the hard in battle threw down his deadly foe when he was angry so that she lay prone on the floor but she very quickly with grimmest of grips requited him and made clutch at him and the weary in soul that strongest of fighters he the stumbled and fell then she sat on that and drew forth her axe broad and and would fain be avenging the death of her child of her only son but on his shoulder was the coat of mail all woven which saved his life and prevented the entrance of the point and the edge of the sword and the son of ecgtheow the prince of geats would have surely gone journey under the wide earth unless that warlike coat of mail had given him help that hard war and unless the holy god he the cunning lord and the ruler in the heavens had wielded the victory and easily decided the issue aright then he straightway stood up xxiii hen among the weapons he caught sight of sword rich in victories an old weapon of the giants and doughty of edge the glory of warriors it was the choicest of weapons

after his death he suf fered stroke hard and then he struck of f his head right soon the proud warriors they who with hrothgar looked forth on the sea could easily see that the sur ging water was all stained with blood and the ancients spoke together about the good man that they deemed not the atheling would ever again come seeking the famous prince hrothgar glorying in victory it seemed unto many that the wolf had destroyed him then came noonday the valiant danes left the headland and the friend of men 39 went homeward thence and the strangers of the geats sick in mind sat and stared at the water they knew and expected not that they would see again their himself then the sword began to grow less after the into icicles of steel and wonder it was that it all began to melt likest to ice when our father doth loosen the band of frost and unwinds the icicles he who hath power over the seasons he is the true god nor in these dwellings did the lord of the geats take any other treasure though much he saw there except the head and the hilt decked out with jewels the sword had melted and the decorated weapon was burnt up the blood was too hot and so poisonous the alien sprite who died

were all cleansed when the alien sprite gave up his life and this fleeting existence he the came swimming to shore he the prince of the men enjoying the the great burden of that which he had with him they advanced towards him and gave thanks to god that glorious crowd of thanes and rejoiced in their lord that they could see him once more then was loosed quickly from that valiant man both helmet and shield the sea became turbid the water under welkin all stained with blood and rejoicing in spirit the brave men went forth with and passed over the earth the pathways and hard task it was each

suf fering that famous lord and i brooded er that with i trusted not in the journey of the dear man and long time i bade thee not whit to be greeting the murderous stranger but to let the south danes themselves wage war against grendel and i now give god thanks that i see thee safe and beowulf answered the son of ecgtheow lord hygelac it is well known to many man our famous meeting and the battle we fought grendel and i on the wide plain when he was working great sorrow to the danes and misery ever all that i avenged so that kinsman of grendel anywhere on earth needed to boast of that uproar by twilight not he of that kindred who liveth the longest encircled by the fen and first to greet hrothgar i went to the and straightway the famous kinsman of healfdene when he knew my intention gave place with his own son and the troop was all joyful nor ever have i seen greater joy amongst any under the arch of heaven sometimes the famous queen 50 the of the folk walked over the whole floor and encouraged the young sons and often she gave to the man twisted ring ere she went to the high seat and sometimes the noble band the daughter of hrothgar carried the to the earls at the end of the high

guardian of the kingdom has brought this to pass and taken that counsel so to set at rest by that betrothal many slaughter and ancient strife and often it happens that little while after the fall of people the deadly spear seldom lieth at rest though the bride be doughty and this may displease the lord of the heathobards and all of his thanes of the people when he with his bride walketh over the

said canst thou recognize my friend the dire sword which thy father carried to the battle under the visored helm on that last journey when the danes slew him and had the in their power when withergyld

shouldst rightly then he exhorteth and bringeth to mind each of the occasions with sorrowful words until the time cometh that the thane of the bride dieth all stained with blood the deeds of his father by the piercing of the sword having forfeited his life but the other thence escapeth alive he knows the land well then the of earls is broken on both sides when deadly enmities sur ge up against ingeld and his love his wife grows cooler after whelming care and this reason i reckon not sincere the friendliness of the heathobards towards the danes or the between them the plighted troth now i speak out again about grendel that thou knowest full well giver of treasure how went that fight of the heroes when the jewel of heaven glided over the world then the angry sprite the terrible

famous thane banesman by biting and devoured whole the dear man nor would he the slayer mindful of bales go out any sooner again forth from the but he proved my strength of main and he grasped at an ample and wondrous glove hung fast by cunning bands and it was cunningly fashioned by the craft of devils and with skins of the dragon and the fierce doer of deeds was wishful to put therein one among many but he could not so i angrily stood upright and too long would it be to tell how i requited all evil to that scather of the people where i my honoured thy people by means of good deeds he escaped on the way and little while he enjoyed but his right hand showed his tracks in hart and he sank to the bottom of the sea all abject and sad of heart and the lord of the danes rewarded that with many

had befallen the prince of the people then the prince sad in mood by thy life entreated that i should deed worthy of an earl midst welter of waters and risk my life and achieve glory and he promised rewards i then discovered the grim and terrible guardian of the whelming waters at the sea s bottom so widely talked of there was engagement between us while and the sea boiled with gore i cut of f

sniffed at the stone and the saw the of his foe he had stepped too far forth with cunning craft near the head of the dragon so may any one who is undoomed easily escape woes and exile who rejoices in

and very furious was the keeper of that barrow and the loathsome one would fain be requiting the robbery of that dear with fire and flame then the dragon wished day was departing not any longer would he wait within walls but went forth girt with baleful fire and terrible was this beginning to the people in that country and sorrowful would be the ending to their lord the giver of treasure xxxiii hen the fiend began to belch forth fire and to burn up the glorious palace and the flames thereof were horror to men nor would the loathly air leave aught living thereabouts and this warfare of the dragon was seen far and wide by men this striving of the foe who caused dire distress and how the war hated and harmed the people of the geats and he hurried back to his hoard and the dark of which he was lord ere it was he had encircled the dwellers in that land with fire and brand he trusted in his cavern and in battle and his clif wall but his hope deceived him then was the terror made known to beowulf quickly and soothly namely that his very homestead that best of houses that throne of the geats was dissolving in the whelming fire and full rueful was it to the good man and the very greatest of sorrows and the wise man was thinking that he had bitterly angered the wielder of all things the eternal god in the matter of some ancient customs 61 and within his breast gloomy brooding was welling was by means his wont the fiery dragon had destroyed by flame the stronghold of the people both the and neighbouring land and therefore the king of the devised revenge upon him now beowulf the prince of earls and protector of warriors commanded them to fashion him glorious war all made of iron he well knew that wooden shield would be unavailing against flames he the noble atheling must await the end of days that were fleeting of this he and the dragon together though long he had held sway over the hoard of treasure and the prince of rings scorned to employ troop against the monster in the great warfare nor did he dread the striving nor did he think much of this battle with the dragon of his might and courage that formerly in close conflict had he escaped many time from the

boasting of that battle on foot they who bore their linden shields against him and few of them ever reached their homes safe from that wolf of the battle but beowulf son of ecgtheow swam er the expanse of waters miserable and solitary back to his people where hygd prof fered him treasures and kingdom rings and dominion she did not think that her son heardred would know how to hold their native seats against strangers now that hygelac was dead nor could the wretched people prevail upon the atheling beowulf in any wise to show himself lord of heardred or to be choosing the kingship nevertheless he gave friendly counsel to the folk with grace and honour until that he heardred was older and held sway over the then those exiles the sons of ohthere sought him over the seas they had rebelled against the lord of the swedes the best of the that famous chieftain of those who bestowed rings in sweden and that was life s limit to him the son of hygelac famishing there was allotted

the courageous encounters until the day on which he was to wage war with the dragon and so it came to pass that the lord of the geats went forth with twelve others and inflamed with fury to spy out the dragon he had heard tell of the malice and hatred he had shown to men whence arose that feud and by the hand of the informer famous treasure came into their possession he was the thirteenth man in

the mead and promised our in the beer he who gave to us rings that we would yield to him war both helmets and if such need befell him and he chose us this warfare and this journey of his own free will and reminded us of glory and to he gave these gifts when he counted us good spear and brave although our lord this guardian of the people had it in his mind all alone to this brave work us he most of all men could glorious things and desperate deeds of war and now is the day come that our lord hath need of our prowess and of goodly warriors let us then go to the help of our while it lasts the grim terror of fire god knows well of that i would much rather that the flame should embrace my body together with that of my lord the giver of gold nor does it seem to to be fitting that we should carry shields back to the homestead except we have first laid low the foe and protected the life of the prince of the weders 70 and well i know that his old deserts were not that he alone of the youth of the geats should suf fer grief and sink in the fighting so both sword and helmet byrny and shield shall be common to both of us together then he waded through the slaughter and bore the war to the

him with craft and keenness was fitting him to he paid heed to the head of the dragon but the brave man s hand was being burnt when he helped his kinsman but that warrior in arms struck at the hostile sprite somewhat lower in his body so that his shining and sword sank into his body and the fire proceeding therefrom began to abate then the good king beowulf got possession of his wits again and drew his bitter and short sword that he bore on his shield and the king of the geats cut asunder the dragon in the midst of his body and the fiend fell prone courage had driven out his life and they two

his wounds and carried the net and the coat of mail adorned under the roof of the barrow and wiglaf exulting in victory came by the seat he saw many gems shining and shaped like the sun 72 and gleaming gold all lying on the ground and wondrous decorations on the wall and he saw too the den of the dragon the ancient and flagons standing there and vessels of men of days long gone by longer polished but shorn of adornment and there also was many helmet ancient and rusty and many cunningly twisted the possession of treasure and of gold on the earth may easily make proud all of mankind let

their need i may longer be lingering here thou bid the famous warriors erect after the burning of the funeral pyre at the edge of the sea which shall tower aloft on whale s ness memorial my people and so the shall call it the hill of beowulf even those who drive the high ships from afar through the mists of the then he the bold prince dof fed from his neck the golden ring and he gave it to his

javelins when their lord had sore need of their help but they were filled with shame and carried their shields and to where the old prince was lying and they looked on wiglaf he the sat aweary near to the shoulders of his lord and sought to rouse him by sprinkling water upon him but he succeeded not at all nor could he though he wished it ever so much keep life in the chieftain or avert whit the

them who sat in the hall both helmet and byrny the prince to his thanes he could find any of you most noble far or near that he wholly wrongly bestowed upon you war when war befell him the king of the folk needed not indeed to boast of his army comrades yet god the wielder of victory granted to him that alone he avenged himself with the edge of the sword when he had need of strength and but little could i give him in the battle yet i sought to help him beyond my strength the dragon was by so much the weaker when i struck with my sword that deadly foe and less fiercely the fire sur ged forth from his head too few were the defenders thronged around their lord when his fated hour came and now shall the receiving of treasure and the gift of swords and all joy of home and hope cease ever to

there is an expectation of time of war to the people since to franks and frisians the fall of the king has become widely known the hard strife was shapen against the hugs when hygelac came with fleet into the frisian lands 76 where the hetware overcame him in battle and by their great strength and courage brought it to pass that the should stoop he fell in the troop nor did the prince give jewelled armour to the doughty ones the mercy of the merewing 77 was not always shown to us nor i expect aught of peace or good faith from the swedish people but it was well known that ongentheow 78 bereft hæthcyn the son of hrethel 79 of life over against ravenswood when because of pride the warlike swedes first sought out the people of the geats soon ongentheow the wise father of ohthere the ancient and terrible gave him hæthcyn return blow destroyed the and rescued his bride queen elan he the old man rescued his wife bereft of gold the mother of onela and of ohthere and then followed up the deadly foe until with dif ficulty they retreated all to ravenswood and he attacked the remnant 80 with great army weary though he was with his wounds and the night he vowed woe upon the wretched troop and said that on the morrow he would by the edge of the sword slay some and hang them up on the sport of the birds but help came to the sorrowful in soul at the dawn of day when they heard the horn of hygelac and the blast of his trumpet when the good man came on the track faring with the doughty warriors of the people xli nd the of both swedes and geats the slaughter of warriors was widely seen how the folk stirred up the feud amongst them the good man wise and very sad went away with his comrades to seek out stronghold earl ongentheow turned away to higher ground he the one had heard of the prowess of hygelac the proud he had trust in his power to resist or that he would be able to refuse the demands of the seamen the or defend the treasure he had taken the children and the bride 81 thence afterwards being old he sought refuge under the wall then was chase given to the people of the swedes and the banner of hygelac borne aloft and they swept er the field of peace when the sons of hrethel thronged to the entrenchment and there too was 173 174 contents 175 the story of beowulf https he the king of the people driven to bay at the edge of the sword and forced to submit to the sole doom of eofor and angrily did wulf son of wanred smite him with weapon so that from that swinging blow gushed forth in streams under the hair of his head yet the old swede was not terrified thereby but quickly gave back terrible blow by worse exchange when the king of the people turned thither nor could wulf the bold son of wanred give back blow to the old churl ongentheow had formerly cut his helmet in two so that he stained with blood fell prone perforce to the ground but not yet was he doomed but he raised himself up though the wound touched him close and the hardy thane of hygelac eofor when his brother lay prostrate caused the broad sword the old giant s sword to crash through the wall of shields upon the gigantic helmet then stooped the king the shepherd of the people mortally wounded and there were many who bound up his kinsman and quickly upraised him when room had been made so that they might possess the while one warrior was plundering another one took the iron shield of ongentheow and his sword and his helmet and carried the trappings of the old man to hygelac and he received the treasures and fairly he promised reward the people and he did he promised the lord of the geats hygelac son of hrethel rewarded with very costly gifts the battle onset of eofor and wulf when he got back to his palace and bestowed upon each of them hundred thousand of land and locked rings nor could any man in the world reproach him that reward since they had gained glory by fighting and he gave to eofor his only daughter she who graced his homestead to wed favour and this is the feud and the enmity and hostile strife of men which i expect the swedish people will seek to awaken against us when they shall hear we have lost our prince he who in days of yore held treasure and kingdom against our foes after the fall of heroes and held in check the fierce swede and did what was good the people and deeds worthy of an earl now is it best us to hasten to look upon our king and bring him who gave to us rings to the funeral pyre nor shall part only of the treasure be melted with the proud man but there is hoard of wealth an immense mass of gold bought at grim cost now at the very end of his life he bought us rings and the brands shall devour all the treasures and the flames of the funeral fire they shall enfold them nor shall an earl carry away any treasure memorial nor shall any maid all beauteous wear on her neck ring adornments but shall go sad of soul and bereft of gold and often not once only tread an alien land now that the man beowulf has laid aside laughter the games and the joys of song and many morning cold shall the spear in the be heaved up on high nor shall there be the sound of harping to awaken the warriors but the war eager over the doomed ones shall say many things to the eagle how it fared with him in eating the carrion while he with the wolf plundered the thus then was the brave warrior reciting loathly spells and he lied not at all in weird or word then the troop rose up together and all unblithely went under eagles ness to look on the wonder and tears were welling then they found him on the sand in his last and bereft of

under the cliff the guardian thereof had slain some few in former days then had the feud been wrathfully avenged and it is mystery anywhere when valiant earl reaches the end of his destiny when man may longer with his kinsman dwell in the hall and thus was it with beowulf when he sought out the guardian of the cavern and his cunning crafts and he himself knew not how his departure from this world would come about and thus famous chieftains uttered deep curses until the day of doom because they had allowed it to come to pass that the monster should be guilty of such crimes and accursed

pleasantly room was made and faring was granted to in under the and in much haste i took very great burden of in my hand and bore it forth hither to my king he was still alive wise and witting well

and then let us carry the dear man our lord when he shall enjoy the protection of the ruler of all then the son of weohstan the warrior ordered that commandment should be given to many hero and householder that they should bring the wood the funeral pyre from far they the to where the good man lay dead now the war shall wax and the fire shall eat up the strong chief among warriors him who often endured the iron shower when the storm of arrows strongly impelled shot over the and the shaft did good service and all eager with its feather fear followed and aided the then the proud son of weohstan summoned from the troop the thanes of the king seven of them together and the very best of them and he the eighth went under the hostile roof and one of the warriors carried in his hand torch which went on in front and wise was it allotted who should plunder that hoard since they saw some part unguarded remaining in the hall and lying there fleeting and little did any man mourn when full heartily they carried forth the costly treasures then they shoved the dragon the worm over the clif wall and let the wave take him and the flood embrace that guardian of the treasures then the twisted golden ornaments were loaded on wagon an immense number of them and the noble atheling the hoar was carried to whales ness xliii hen the people of the geats got ready the mighty funeral pyre and hung it round with helmets and and bright byrnies he had asked and in the midst they lay the famous prince and they lamented the hero their dear lord then the warriors began to stir up the greatest of

the beacon of the mighty in battle in ten days and the leavings of the funeral fire they surrounded with wall so that very proud men might find it to be most worthy of reverence and they did on the barrow rings and necklaces and all such adornments formerly warlike men had taken of the hoard and they allowed the earth to hold the treasure of earls the gold on the ground where it still is to be found useless to men it always was 83 then the men rode round about the mound the children of the athelings twelve of them there were in all and would be uttering their sorrows and lamenting their king and reciting dir ge and speaking of their champion and they talked of his earlship and of his brave works and deemed them doughty is fitting that man should praise his lord in words and cherish him in his heart when he shall have gone forth from the fleeting body so the people of the geats lamented over the fall of their lord his companions and said that he was and the mildest the gentlest

chocilaicus who was killed this chocilaicus is identified with the hygelac of our poem and the raid with hygelac s raid on the hetware chatuarii the franks and the frisians this helps us to estimate the date beowulf having been born somewhere about the end of the fifth century historia francorum by gregory of tours the author speaks of the raider the king of the danes liber monstr orum in this work the raider is rex getarum king of the geats who may correspond with the geats of our poem the geats were the people of gautland in southern sweden see appendix xi 189 190 the story of beowulf https of the poem it was probably written in northumbrian or midland but was preserved in west saxon translation there would seem to be some justifiable doubt to the unity of the poem though on the whole pagan and primitive in tone it has considerable admixture of christian elements on pp 29 and 30 and pp 12 though the latter passage may be late interpolation generally speaking the poetry and sentiments are christian in tone but the customs are pagan the author of the article in the cambridge history of english literatur vol to whom i owe much says i can not believe that any christian poet could have composed the account of beowulf s one passage is very reminiscent of eph vi 16 viz chapter xxv 1 11 whilst page 25 lower half may be compared with cædmon s hymn there are also references to cain and abel and to the deluge of chapters the percentage of christian elements is four whilst of the remaining chapters xxxii ad fin the percentage is ten due chiefly to four long passages note especially that the words in chapter and sometimes they went vowing at their heathen shrines and of fered sacrifices et are quite inconsistent with the christian sentiment attributed to hrothgar later in the poem it is generally thought says the writer in the cambridge history of english literatur that several originally separate lays have been combined into one poem and while there is proof of this it is quite possible and not unlikely there are in the poem four distinct lays beowulf s fight with grendel beowulf s fight with grendel s mother beowulf s return to the land of the geats beowulf s fight with the dragon competent critics say that probably 1 and 2 ought to be taken together while beowulf s reception by hygelac see 3 above is probably separate lay some scholars have gone much further in the work of disintegration even attributing one half of the poem to interpolators whilst others suggest two parallel versions summing up the writer in the cambridge history of english literatur says i am disposed to think that lar ge portion of the poem existed in epic form before the change of faith and that the appearance of christian elements in the poem is due to revision the christianity of beowulf is of singularly indefinite and individual type which contrasts somewhat strongly with what is found in later old english poetry this revision must have been made at very early the poem was built up between 512 the date of the famous raid of hygelac chocilaicus against the hetware chatuarii and 752 when the french merovingian dynasty fell says arnold the poem 191 192 the story of beowulf https not word which by any human ingenuity could be tortured into reference to any event subsequent to the fall of the merovingians 752 ii the prelude the prelude would seem to be an attempt to link up the hero of the poem with the mythological progenitors of the teutonic nations thomas arnold says that sceaf scyld and beaw were among the legendary ancestors of the west saxon line of kings one disputes but this does not mean much the poem itself shows that the same three were also among the legendary ancestors of the danish ethelward who wrote early in the tenth century gives the ancestry of ethelwulf the father of alfred ethelward says the seventeenth ancestor from cerdic was beo the eighteenth scyld the nineteenth ethelward also says scef himself with one light vessel arrived in the island of the ocean which is called scani dressed in armour and he was very young boy and the inhabitants of that land knew nothing about him however he was received by them and kept with care and af fection though he were of their own kin and afterwards they chose him to be king from whose stock the king athulf ethelwulf derives his it may be noted that neither scyld nor scef is mentioned in the chronicle 855 william of malmesbury in his gesta regum says that scef was so called from the sheaf of wheat that lay at his head that he was asleep when he arrived and that when he grew up he became king in the town then called slaswic now haithebi rolls 1 121 müllenhof f says if we look closely into the saga the ship and the sheaf clearly point to navigation and agriculture the arms and jewels to kingly four gifts therefore to the main elements and foundations of the oldest state of culture among the germans t eutons of the board and if the bearer of these symbols became the first king of the country the meaning can only be this that from his appearance the beginning of the oldest state of culture dates and that generally before him orderly way of leading human life had scyld meaning shield refers to the fact that the king was the protector of the people in war and is therefore symbolical like scef the ship and the sheaf the arms and the jewels and the are the symbols of that primitive sheaf the symbol of agriculture and food the ship of commerce the arms of warfare the jewels of reward of bravery and the shield of the protection of the people by the king arnold mentions the fact that writer not english mentions the saga of scef and scyld and suggests that this is presumption the english origin of the legend i not however think it is conclusive evidence one is surprised that they are not mentioned in icelandic literature yet 193 contents 194 195 the story of beowulf https the impression on my mind is that these legends were probably brought by our saxon and danish ancestors from the continent and are taken granted well known to the hearers of the song i think they probably formed part of the legendary genealogy of our common germanic t eutonic ancestors and happened to find their way into literature only among the english or have survived only in the english iii brosinga mene brosinga mene 82 is the mentioned in the edda an icelandic poem this necklace is the costly necklace of freja which she won from the dwarfs and which was stolen from her by loki is told in the edda kemble loki was scandinavian he was beautiful and cunning he was the principle of strife the spirit of evil cp job s satan freya was the scandinavian goddess of love she claimed half of the slain in battle she was the dispenser of joy and happiness the german frau is derived from freya hama carried of f this necklace when he fled from eormanric the origin of this legend though worked up in the edda seems to have been german or gothic and brosinga has reference to the of breisgau on the rhine it is probably relic of the lost saga of eormanric see appendix iv the famous ostrogothic king referred to in chapter xviii eormanric is one of the few historical personages of the poem iv eormanric gibbon mentions eormanric in his chapter xxv of the decline and fall and in spite of chronological discrepancies this eormanric is probably identical with the one mentioned in beowulf chapter xviii in jornandes chapter xxiv and in the edda in jornandes the story is follows characters ermanaric chief of the roxolani tribe who was traitor sanielh swanhild wife of the chief brothers of contents 196 contents 197 the story of beowulf https puts sanielh to death by causing her to be torn to pieces by wild horses because of the treachery of her husband the chief of the roxolani her brothers ammius and sarus avenge her death by attacking ermanaric but they only succeed in wounding him and disabling him the rest of his life in the edda the story is follows characters gudrun widow of sigurd and atli swanhild daughter of gudrun by sigurd jonakur gudrun s third husband sörli sons of gudrun and jonakur hamthir erp jormunrek eormanric randver son of jormunrek jormunrek hears of the beauty of swanhild and sends his son randver to seek her out him in marriage gudrun consents on the way randver is incited by the traitor bicci to betray swanhild and is then accused by him to the king this treachery jormunrek hangs randver and causes swanhild to be trampled to death by wild horses then the three sons of gudrun set out to avenge their sister on the way his two brothers kill erp and are consequently unable to kill jormunrek they only succeed in maiming him saxo grammaticus to whom we also owe the story of hamlet tells similar story characters jarmeric danish king swawilda swanhild wife of jarmeric hellespontine brothers brothers of swawilda bicco servant of jarmeric bicco accuses swawilda to jarmeric of unfaithfulness he causes her to be torn to pieces by wild horses then her brothers kill jarmeric with the help of witch gudrun hewing of f his hands and feet these three stories are evidently based on one common original v marriage of freawaru and ingeld characters frea waru daughter of hrothgar the dane ingeld son of froda king of the heathobards 198 199 contents the story of beowulf https froda king of the heathobards heathobard warrior son of the danish warrior who had killed froda the heathobards were people in zealand there had been an ancient feud between the danes and the heathobards in which froda had been killed by danish warrior hrothgar hoped to appease the feud by the marriage of his daughter freawaru to ingeld unluckily the son of the danish warrior who had killed froda accompanied freawaru to ingeld s court then an old heathobard warrior notices this and stirs up strife the marriage fails in its object and war breaks out again between the danes and the heathobards beowulf predicts the course of events in his speech to hygelac chapters xxviii and xxix vi finn the finn episode chapters xvi and xvii is one of those events in beowulf that would be quite well known to the first hearers of the song but to us is lacking in that clearness we might desire fortunately hickes discovered fragment entitled the fight at finnsbur gh on the back of of the homilies from beowulf and from this fragment we are able to piece together an intelligible story it is probably follows characters finn king of the north frisians and jutes hoc danish chieftain hildeburh daughter of hoc hnaef son of hoc hengest son of hoc two sons of finn and hildeburh hunlafing finnish warrior guthlaf and oslaf two danish warriors finn abducts hildeburh the daughter of hoc the dane hoc pursues the two fugitives and is killed in the mêlée twenty years pass and hengest sons of hoc take up the in the fighting hnaef and son of finn and hildeburh are slain peace is patched up hengest son of hoc is persuaded to remain guest of finn the winter and it is agreed that reference shall be made by either side to the feud between them then the bodies of hnaef hildeburh s brother and of her son are burnt together on the funeral pyre and great is the mourning of hildeburh her but hengest is ever brooding vengeance the strife breaks out anew in the spring hengest is killed but two of his warriors guthlaf and oslaf break through the enemy return to finn s country and slay him and carry of f hildeburh the fight at finnsbur gh which is homeric in style is the account of the first invasion of finn by hnaef and hengest and wyatt fits it in before the finn episode on möller places it after the phrase whose edge was well known to the jutes on p 79 200 contents 201 the story of beowulf https hygelac hygelac son of hrethel was king of the geats and uncle of beowulf his sister s son he was the reigning king of beowulf s fellow countrymen the geats during the greater part of the action of the poem beowulf is often called hygelac s kinsman and when he went forth to his battle with grendel s mother chapter xxii he bade hrothgar in case of his death send the treasures he had given to him to hygelac hygelac married hygd who is presented to us good queen the daughter of hæreth she was very young of noble character and she is compared to her advantage with thrytho who was shrewish woman one dared to look upon her except her husband however her second husband of fa seems to have tamed the shrew see 120 hygelac has been identified with chocilaicus who was killed in the famous raid on the chatuarii referred to in the historia francorum and the gesta regum who are identified with the hetware of this poem see 143 and appendix i the famous raid of hygelac upon the hetware in which he met his death is referred to five times in the poem follows chapters xviii 83 xxxi 134 xxxiii 142 xxxv 151 on the death of hygelac his son heardred succeeded to the throne chapter xxxi 134 and after brief interval he was killed in battle by onela see appendix ix then beowulf succeeded to the throne of the geats chapter xxxi 134 hygelac died between 512 and beowulf died about he reigned fifty years viii hæthcyn and herebald it would seem doubtful to whether this was deliberate or accidental the poet says hæthcyn missed the mark with his javelin and killed his brother herebald but subsequently he speaks though it had been deliberate murder ix wars between the swedes and the geats contents 202 203 contents contents the story of beowulf https swedes ongentheow king of the swedes

the swedes are also called scylfings in the poem the origin of the word scylfing is doubtful ongentheow went to war with hæthcyn king of the geats and brother of hygelac and ongentheow who was well advanced in years struck down his foe chapter 173 at the battle of ravenswood this was the first time that the swedes invaded the geats the geats retreated into the ravenswood at nightfall but with the dawn they heard the horn of hygelac the good prince came marching on the ongentheow now was alarmed hygelac s prowess in battle was far he withdrew into some fortification and was attacked by the geats two brothers eofor and wulf assailed the veteran warrior he defended himself with great vigour and killed wulf but eofor came to the help of his brother and dealt ongentheow his over the guard of his shield ongentheow s two sons were onela and ohthere ohthere had two sons eanmund and eadgils these two sons of ohthere were banished from sweden rebellion and took refuge at the court of the geat king heardred this greatly enraged their uncle onela that they should resort to the court of their hereditary foes see above onela invaded the land of the geats chapters xxxiii and xxxiv pp 144 sq and slew heardred then it was that beowulf became king of the geats thus two geatish kings had been slain by the swedes viz hæthcyn and heardred in revenge later on beowulf supported eadgils in his counter on his own fatherland when eadgils killed his uncle onela this story is confirmed by the scandinavian accounts in which athils eadgils slew ali onela on the ice of lake wener cp the phrase cold journeyings chapter xxxiv 145 this is wyatt s version of the story 204 205 the story of beowulf https sigmund sigmund page 65 is the father and uncle of fitela he is stated in beowulf to have killed serpent who kept guard over hoard of treasure in the icelandic saga known the völsunga saga sigmund is represented the father of sigurd and it is sigurd who rifles the treasure of the niblungs and kills the serpent fafnir its guardian arnold 69 and he carries it away on the back of his horse grani sigmund is represented the son of völsung that is beowulf has it the heir of waels was afterwards forgotten however and waelsing was regarded proper name instead of patronymic denoting descent from waels in similar way arnold points out sigmund is pushed into the background to make room his son sigurd siegfried and so in the german nibelungen lay it is sigurd siegfried who wins the hoard but does so by defeating and killing its former possessors schilbung and nibelung arnold 70 attempts have been made to claim german origin this saga but in face of the evidence of beowulf and the völsunga saga and the edda there is i think with arnold little doubt but that its origin was scandinavian possibly and probably we owe the later elaboration of the saga in the nibelungen lay to german influence discussion of the whole question see arnold s notes on beowulf pp edit 1898 cap v

dwelt in the south of sweden between the danes and the swedes bugge sought to identify them with the jutes and held that gautland was juteland he based this theory on certain phrases chapter xxxiii where the swedes the sons of ohthere are said to have visited the geats across the sea and again in chapter xxxv the swedes and the geats are said to have fought over wide water but arnold points out these phrases can be interpreted in such way not to be incompatible with the theory that they dwelt on the same side of the cattegat on the northern side and in the extreme south of sweden the question to whether they are identical with the goths of roman history is still an open one arnold says there is great weight of evidence tending to identify the geats with the goths and he quotes evidence from gibbon chapter pytheas of marseilles in the fourth century says that passing through the baltic sea he met with tribes of goths teutons and ests tacitus in chapter xliii of germania speaks of the goths dwelling near the swedes jornandes traces the goths to scanzia an island in the northern sea it is probable then that the goths had northern and indeed scandinavian origin if so
