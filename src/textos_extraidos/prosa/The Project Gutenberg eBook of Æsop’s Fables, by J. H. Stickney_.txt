ginn and company all rights reserved the athenæum press ginn and pref ace he good fortune which has attended the earlier edition of this book is proof that there is less occasion now than formerly to plead the cause of fables use in elementary schools and yet their value is still too little recognized the homely wisdom which the fables represent so aptly was more common possession of intelligent people of generation or two ago than it is at the present time it had then better chance of being passed on by natural tradition than is now the case among the less homogeneous parentage of our school children and there has never been greater need than now the kind of character that is afforded by this means in the troub led times in greece in æsop s day centuries ago moral teaching to be salutary must be largely shorn of didactic implications and veiled with wit and satire this insures its most vital working wherever its teaching is pertinent to be whipped warned shamed or encou raged and so corrected over the heads of animals they are represented in the expression of their native traits is the least offensive way that can fall to person s lot amon g several hundred episodes knowledge of which is acquired in childhood part of an educational routine most conservative estimates would allow large substantial results in practical wit and wisdom to be reaped later life calls them it is well recognized by scholars and should be taught to children that not all the fables attributed to æsop are of so early date imitations of his genius all along the centuries have masqueraded under his name facts about him appear in the introduction occasion has been found to change in this edition the style of presentation so highly approved in the original one but considerable number of the stories especially in the earlier pages of the book are ampliﬁed somewhat in language form to accommodate them to the needs of children unfamiliar with the animals portrayed it has been thought wise to present these in the briefer form in which they are general ly known to adult readers these are to be found in an appendix to the present volume the ingenious teacher will ﬁnd numerous ways in which this duplication of stories may be turned to account comparison of the two forms will suggest many exercises to be performed by the pupils themselves in which the longer forms of the fables may be built up from the shorter forms and vice versa the teacher who is interested in dramatic work will ﬁnd also that many of the fables will make excellent material dramatic presentation in the

the eagle and the fox 232 introduction the history of fable odern versions of æsop go back further than 480 in their earliest use they are related to the folklore current among all primitive peoples this folklore had risen in greece to the rank of literary form thousand years before the revival in germany france and england the creation of æsop it was the answer to need trenchant but veiled characterization of men and measures in the dangerous times of the tyrants in utterances quite apart from personal criticism things could be intimated with all the force of speciﬁc judgments yet in such veiled form that to resent them was tacit confession that they applied later on when free speech became safer the grammarians and rhetoricians raised these clever pithy stories to the literary form they have since maintained xii xiii xiv the project gutenberg ebook of æsop s fables by stickney https is æsop s fables authorized original version always it appears they were subject to interpolations and specia l versions they took on metrical forms in latin and in later times in french it is the particular distinction of real fable that it bears this ampliﬁcation yet can at any time and from any true version shake off the accessories of particular phrasing and in its bare facts meet all the requirements of literary and artistic whole it is this static character which has made the fable of such value to language students even little children comparing different versions learn to distinguish the raw material of real story from its varyin g renderings subjoined is an account of æsop called the inventor and father of fable in its present form æ sop the father of the fable the life of æsop like that of homer the most famous of greek poets is involved in much obscurity sardis the capital of lydia samos greek island mesembria an ancient colony in thrace and cotiæum the chief city of province of phrygia contend the distinction of being his birthplace although the honor thus claimed can not be deﬁnitely assigned to any one of these places yet there are few incidents now generally accepted by scholars established facts relating to the birth life and death of æsop he is by an almost universal consent allowed to have been born about the year 620 and to have been by birth slave he was owned by two masters in succession xanthus and jadmon both inhabitants of samos the latter of whom gave him his liberty reward his learning and wit one of the privileges of freedman in the ancient republics of greece was the permission to take an active interest in public affairs and æsop like the philosophers phædo menippus and epictetus in later times raised himself from the indignity of servile condition to position of high renown in his desire alike to instruct and to be instructed he traveled through many countries and among others came to sardis the capital of the famous king of lydia the great patron in that day of learning and of learned men at the court of crœsus he met with solon thales and other sages and is related so to have pleased his royal master by the part he took in the conversations held with these philosophers that crœsus applied to him an expression which has since passed into ὁ φρὑξ the phrygian has spoken better than on the invitation of crœsus he ﬁxed his residence at sardis and was employed by that monarch in various difﬁcult and delicate affairs of state in his dischar ge of these commissions he visited the different petty republics of greece at one time he is found in corinth and at another in athens endeavoring by the narration of some of his wise fables to reconcile the inhabitants of those cities to the administration of their rulers one of these missions undertaken at the command of crœsus was the occasion of his death having been sent to delphi with large sum of gold distribution among the citizens he was so indignant at their covetousness that he refused to divide the money and sent it back to his master the delphians enraged at this treatment accused him of impiety and in spite of his sacred character ambassador executed him public criminal but the great fabulist did not lack posthumous honors statue was erected to his memory at athens the work of lysippus one of the most famous of greek sculptors these few facts are all that can be relied on with any degree of certainty in reference to the birth life and death of æsop the fable on pages is translat ion of la fontaine s metrical version of one of the most popular of the æsop fables la fontaine who died at paris in 1695 was popular writer of drama and the most noted of the french fabulists following this on pages are fables from the russian of krilof f writer who nearly twenty years was one of the librarians at the imperial public library at petersbur g in which city he died in 1844 xv xvi xvii the project gutenberg ebook of æsop s fables by stickney https s f ables æsop s f ables the wolf and

very much alarmed said gently i not see how it can be that i have spoiled the water you stand higher up the stream and the water runs from you to not from to be that it may said the wolf with snarl

not make such noise the third time they met the fox was not frightened at all he ran up to the lion and said what are you roaring about and the lion was so taken by surprise that without saying word he let the fox walk away it would not be safe little foxes always to follow the example of this one but it is often true that what our fear makes seem lion in the way has danger in it if we meet it

him when looking up he spied some great clusters of ripe black grapes hanging from trellised vine what luck he said if only they weren t quite so high i should be sure of ﬁne feast i wonder if i can

cried the wolf be thankful that i did not bite your head off when it was in my mouth you ought to be content with gentle kindly folk sometimes have to learn that kindness must be mixed with caution the ants and the grasshoppers he ants and the grasshoppers lived together in the great ﬁeld the ants were busy all the time gathering store of grain to lay by winter use they gave themselves so little pleasure that their merry neighbors the grasshoppers began at last to take scarcely any notice of them when the frost came it put an end to the work of the ants and the chirping and merrymaking of the grasshoppers but one ﬁne winter s day when the ants were employed in spreading their grain in the sun to dry grasshopper who was nearly perishing with hunger chanced to pass by good day to you kind

such splash that the frogs were terriﬁed and hid themselves in the deep mud under the water by and by one braver than the rest peeped out to look at the king and saw the log it lay quietly on the top of the water soon one after another they all came out of their hiding places and ventured to look at their great king the log did not move they swam round it keeping safe distance away and at last one by one hopped upon it this is not king said wise old frog it is nothing but stupid log if we had king jupiter would pay more attention to again they sent to jupiter and begged him to give them king
