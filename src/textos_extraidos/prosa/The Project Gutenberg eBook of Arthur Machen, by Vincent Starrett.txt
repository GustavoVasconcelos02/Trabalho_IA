http ar thur machen novelist of ecst asy and the project gutenberg ebook of arthur machen by vincent starrett https vincent st arrett with two uncollected poems by arthur machen chicago walter hill 1918 note with singular unanimity critics thirty years have slighted the work of arthur machen line sufﬁces him in holbrook jackson the eighteen nineties and murdoch ignores him completely in the renaissance of the nineties yet those are the standard works on the period to which chronologically at least machen belongs with greater appreciatio n gives him in his schola rly work the inﬂuence of baudelaire but even that is made up largely of quotations from the hill of dreams to prove machen descendent of error to which i subscribed until machen himself disillusioned although the assertion is still partially true because in my opinion arthur machen is the outstanding artist of his time and one of the great masters of all time i wrote the following paper which ﬁrst appeared in reedy mirror october 5 that issue is not now obtainable and calls it continue to come to and to the publisher i ﬁnd ground belief that machen may at length be coming into his own tardy phenomenon which i am happy to hasten so far it lies within my power walter hill shares this feeling and this brochure is the result i am indebted to william marion reedy permission to reprint those parts of the article which appeared in his journal arthur m achen some thirty odd years ago young man of the son of welsh clergyman fresh from school and with his head full of curiously occult mediaevalism privately acquired from yellowed palimpsests and volumes of black letter wrote classic more he had it published only one review copy was sent out that was to le livre of paris it fell into the hands of octa ve uzanne who instantly ordered the project gutenberg ebook of arthur machen by vincent starrett https boccaccio to shove over on the immortal seats and make room by their side the author the book was the chronicle of clemendy the author arthur machen three years ago about not long after the great war ﬁrst shook the world london evening newspaper published inconspicuously purely ﬁctional account of supposed incident of the british retreat from mons it described the miraculous intervention of the english archers of agincourt at time when the british were sore pressed by the german hordes immediately churchmen spiritualists and host of others seized upon it an authentic record and the miracle an omen in the hysteria that followed arthur machen its author found himself man because he wrote to the papers denying that the narrative was factual later when his little volume the bowmen and other legends of the war appeared in print it met with an extraordinary and rather impertinent success but what had machen been doing all those long years between 1885 and 1914 in day of haphazard ﬁction and rodomontade criticism the advent of master workman is likely to be unheralded if indeed he is fortunate enough to ﬁnd publisher to put him between covers machen is not newcomer however we have seen immediate success with best seller furnishes an incentive complimentary notice he is an unknown in spite of clemendy in spite of the bowmen in spite of everything thirty years he has been writing english prose period ample the making of dozen reputations of the ordinary kind and in that time he has produced just ten books in thirty years harold bindloss and rex beach will have written books and sold the moving picture rights of them all of course it is exactly because he does not write books of the ordinary kind that arthur machen reputation writer was not made long ago his apotheosis will begin after his death the insectial fame of the popular novelist is immediate it is born at dawn and dies at sunset the enduring fame of the artist too often is born at sunset but it is immortal more than hawthorne or tolstoy machen is novelist of the soul he writes of strange borderland lying somewhere between dreams and death peopled with shade s beings spirits ghosts men women shall we call them very notion of whom stops vaguely just short of thought he writes of the life satyr him pan is not dead his votaries still whirl through woodland windings to the mad pipe that was syrinx and carouse ﬁercely in enchanted forest grottoes hidden somewhere perhaps in the fourth dimension his meddling with the crucibles of science is appalling in its daring its magniﬁcence and its horror even the greater works of ﬁctional dr jekyll and hyde if you before his astounding inferences and suggestions it is his theory that the fearful and shocking rites of the bacchic cultus survive in this disillusioned age that panic lechery and wickedness did not cease with the agony browning and others would have us believe of hawthorne arthur symons wrote he is haunted by what is obscure dangerous and on the conﬁnes of good and evil machen crosses those perilous frontiers he all but lifts the veil himself indeed passes beyond it but the curtain drops behind him and we hesitating to follow see only dimly the phantasmagoria beyond the ecstasies of vague shapes with shining about them on the one hand on the other the writhings of animate gargoyles and we experience i think distinct sense of gratitude toward this terrible guide that we are permitted closer view of the mysteries that seem to him so clear we glimpse his secrets in transﬁguring ﬂashes from afar launcelot viewed the san graal and like that tarnished knight we quest vainly tangible solution half in apprehension always in glamour but it is like galahad we must seek the eternal mysteries that obsess arthur machen there is solution but in absolution it is the mysteries of life and death of which he writes and of and the project gutenberg ebook of arthur machen by vincent starrett https particular reference to machen two most important books the house of souls and the hill of dreams in which he reaches his greatest stature novelist of the soul there are those who will call him novelist of sin quibbling about deﬁnition with these i have quarrel the characterizations are synonymous his books exhale all evil and all corruption yet they are pure the fabled waters of that crystal spring leon sought they are pervaded by an intoxicating sense of sin ravishingly beautiful furiously pagan frantically lovely but machen is ﬁner and truer mystic than the occultists who guide modern spiritualistic thought if we are to subscribe to his curious philosophy to be discussed later we must believe that there is paradox in this but something of what we are getting at is explained in his own pages in this opening paragraph from his story the white people in the house of souls and sanctity said ambrose are the only realities each is an ecstasy withdrawal from the common life and little later in this is something profoundly unnatural about sin the essence of which really is in the taking of heaven by storm one gathers from general vagueness on the subject that sin is not popular in these times there are of course new sins and advanced sins and higher sins all of which are intensely interesting the chief puzzle to the lay mind is why they should bear these names since they are usually neither new advanced and high nor particularly sinful i am speaking of sin an offense against the nature of things and of evil in the soul which has very little to with the sins of the statute book sin according to the same ambrose i have quoted is conceivable in the talking of animals if chair should walk across room that would be sinful or if tree sat down with us to afternoon tea the savage who worships conjurer is far ﬁner moralist than the civilise who suspects him i use the name moralist one who has an appreciation of sin this is not the sin of the legal code ambr ose i conceive to be arthur machen there are only two realities sorcery and and each is an ecstasy arthur machen is the former perhaps his most remarkable i think his most terrible story is the great god pan at ﬁrst published separately with the inmost light now occurring in the house of souls it is the story of an experiment upon girl result of which moment she is permitted sight of the great god beyond the veil with shocking consequences yet it is told with exquisite reticence and grace and with plausi bility that is extraordinary it is immoral here is the conclusion of that story what i said mary would see she saw but i forgot that human eyes could look on such vision with impunity and i forgot i have just said that when the house of life is thus thrown open there may enter in that which we have name and human ﬂesh may become the veil of horror one dare not express the blackened face the hideous form upon the bed changing and melting before your eyes from woman to man from man to beast and from beast to worse than beast all the strange horror that you witnessed surprises but little what you say the doctor you sent saw and shuddered at i noticed long ago i knew what i had done the moment the child was born and when it was ﬁve years old i surprised it not once or twice but several times with playmate you may guess of what kind and now helen is with her companions there is the very quintessence of horror in the unutterable suggestion of such passages the hill of dreams i have found its reading one of the most desolate and appalling experiences in literature reading it himself years after publication its author decided that it was depressing book that is undoubtedly true but spiritually well technically it marks to date the topm ost pinnacle of his tormented genius it reaches heights so rareﬁed that breathing literally becomes painful to the casual reader the project gutenberg ebook of arthur machen by vincent starrett https absurd hyperbolical if not hypocritical rant but in day when majority of critics ﬁnd it difﬁcult to restrain themselves in speaking of harold bell wright and place jeffery farnol beside fielding and thackeray one can not go far wrong in indulging few enthusiasms so genuine an artist arthur machen of the reviewers into whose hands fell this remarkable book in the year of its publication 1907 only one appears to have valued it at its real editor of the academy who carried away by the tale and its telling turned out bit of critical prose which might have been lifted from the book itself there is something sinister in the beauty of machen book he wrote it is like some strangely shaped orchid the colour of which is ﬁerce and terrible and its perfume is haunting to suffocation by reason of its intolerable sweetness the cruelty of the book is more savage than any of the cruelty which the book describes lucian shuddered at the boys who were deliberately hanging an ungainly puppy he had thrashed the little rufﬁan who kicked the sick cat before he wrapped himself away from the contact of such infamy in the shelter of his own imaginings in hill of dreams you seem to be shown lovely sensitive boy who has fashioned himself white palace of beauty in his own mind he has had time only to realize its full beauty when disease lays its cold touch upon him and gathers him into her grasp until he lies decayin g and horrible seeing his own decay and seeing that his decay makes the white palace foul the boys did not chant songs they looped the string round the neck of the uncou th puppy machen fashions prose out of the writhings of lucian who is dear to him and his prose has the rhythmic beat of some dreadful oriental instrument insistent monotonous haunting and still the soft tone of one careful ﬂute sounds on and keeps the nerves alive to the slow and growing pain of the rhythmic beat lucian in ecstacy of worship the young girl whose lips have given him new life pressed his body against sharp thorns until the white ﬂesh of his body was red with drops of blood that too is the spirit of the book it is like some dreadful liturgy of pain set to measured music and the cadence of that music becomes intolerable by its suave phrasing and perfect modulation the last long chapte r with its recurring themes is masterpiece of prose and in its way unique after that there would seem to be need further comment on the hill of dreams but there is quite important what machen says is his manner of saying it he possesses an english prose style which in its mystical suggestion and beauty is unlike any other i have encountered there is ecstacy in his pages huysmans in really good translation suggests machen better perhaps than another both are debtors to baudelaire 1 the ecstasy one ﬁnds in machen work of which more anon is due in small degree to his beautiful english style abominable word but machen is mere juggler his vocabulary while astonishing and extensive is not affectedly so yet his sentences move to sonorous ged rhythms swooning with pagan color and redolent of sacerdotal incense what is the secret of this graceful english method it is this he achieves his striking results and effects through his noteworthy gift of selection and arrangement i had reached this conclusion i think before i encountered passage from the hill of dreams which clinched it language he understood was chieﬂy important the beauty of its sounds by its possession of words resonant glorious to the ear by its capacity when exquisitely arranged of suggesting wonderful and indeﬁnable impressions perhaps more ravishing and further removed from the domain of strict thought than the impressions excited by music itself here lay hidden the secret of suggestion the art of causing sensation by the use of words was it ever better expressed he deﬁnes his method and exhibits its results at the same time and dipping almost at random into the same volume here is further example the project gutenberg ebook of arthur machen by vincent starrett https method slowly and timidly he began to untie his boots fumbling with the laces and glancing all the while on every side at the ugly misshapen trees that hedged the lawn not branch was straight not one was free but all were interlaced and grew one about another and just above ground where the cankered stems joined the protuberant roots there were forms that imitated the human shape and faces and twining limbs that amazed him green mosses were hair and tresses were stark in grey lichen twisted root swelled into limb in the hollows of the rooted bark he saw the masks of men he gazed across the turf and into the thicket the sunshine seemed really to become green and the contrast between the bright glow poured on the lawn and the black shadows of the brake made an odd ﬂickering light in which all the grotesque postures of stem and root began to stir the wood was alive the turf beneath him heaved and sunk with the deep swell of the sea and he could imagine man who was able to live on one sense while he pleased to whom example every impression of touch taste hearing or seeing should be translated into odor who at the desired kiss should be ravished with the scent of dark violets to whom music should be the perfume of rose garden at dawn this is not prose at all but poetry and poetry of high order and it is from such beautiful manipulation of words phrases and rhythms that machen attains his most clairvoyant and arresting effects in the realms of horror dread and terror from the strange gesturings of trees the glow of clouds the somber beauty of brooding ﬁelds and valleys all too still the mystery of lovely women and all the terror of life and nature seen with the understanding eye so much arthur machen novelist it is fascinating subject but it is also an extensive one and the curious tenuous quality of his work may lead one into indiscretions the peculiar philosophy of arthur machen is set down in hieroglyphics and in stiggins his views and principles the ﬁrst chapter of the latter work is scathing satire on certain foibles and idiosyncracies of the american lynching and it is on the whole polemica l volume which by the nature of the subjects it treats can have less permanent interest than the author other work it may be put to one side although specimen of machen impeccable prose it must not be ignored in hieroglyphics he returns to those ecstasies mentioned in the white people and gives us further deﬁnitions the word ecstasy is merely symbol it has many synonyms it means rapture adoration withdraw al from common life the other things who can furnish precise deﬁnition of the indeﬁnable they the things are sometimes in the song of bird sometimes in the whirl of london street sometimes hidden under great lonely hill some of us seek them with most hope and the fullest assurance in the sacring of the mass others receive tidings through the sound of music in the color of picture in the shining form of statue in the meditation of eternal truth hieroglyphics is arthur machen theory of literature brilliantly exposited by that cyclical mode of discoursing that was affected by coleridge in it he promulgates the admirable doctrine that ﬁne literature must be in effect an allegory and not the careful history of particular persons he seeks mark of division which is to separate ﬁne literature from mere literature and ﬁnds the solution in the one word ecstasy or if the project gutenberg ebook of arthur machen by vincent starrett https beauty wonder awe mystery sense of the unknown desire the unknown with this conclusion if ecstasy be present then i say there is ﬁne literature if it be absent then in spite of all the cleverness all the talents all the workman ship and observation and dexterity you may show then i think we have product possibly very interesting one which is not ﬁne literature following this reasoning by an astonishing sequence of arguments he proceeds to the bold experiment of proving pickwick possessed of ecstasy and vanity fair lacking it the case is an extreme one he admits deliberately chosen to expound his theory to the nth degree the analytical key to the test is found in the differentiation between art and artiﬁce nice problem in such extreme instances poe dupin stories and stevenson jekyll and hyde machen points out by this ingenious method the odyssey oedipus morte kubla khan don quixote and rabelais immediately are proven ﬁne literature host of other esteemed work s merely if you like good literature pantagruel by more delicate application of the test becomes ﬁner work than don quixote and in the exposition of this dictum we come upon one of the mountain peaks of machen amazing philosophy he begins the discussion with jest about the enormous capacity strong drink exhibited by pickwick and his friends and reminds us that it was the god of wine in whose honor sophocles wrote his dramas and choral songs who was worshi pped and invoked at the dionysiaca and that all the drama arose from the celebration of the bacchic mysteries he goes on to the gargantua and pantagruel which reek of wine dickens does of brandy and water the rabelaisian history begins grandgousier estoit bon raillar d en son temps aimant boire net and ends with the oracle of the holy bottle with the word trinch un mot panomphée celebré et entendu toute s nations et nous signiﬁe beuvez and i refer you continues machen to the allocution of bacbuc the priestess of the bottle at large wine she says man made divine and i may say that if you have not got the key to these rabelaisian riddles much of the highest the book is lost to you seeking the meaning of this bacchic cultus this apparent gloriﬁcation of drunkenness in all lands and in all times from ancien t greece through renascent france to victorian england by peoples and persons not themselves given to excess he ﬁnds it again in the word ecstasy we are to conclude that both the ancient people and the modern writers recognized ecstasy the supreme gift and state of man and that they chose the vine and the juice of the vine the most beautiful and signiﬁcant symbol of that power which withdraws man from the common life and the common consciousness and taking him from the dust of earth sets him in high places in the eternal world of ideas let us never forget that the essence of the book is in its splendid celebration of ecstasy under the ﬁgure of the vine at this point machen places the key in our hands and declines further to reveal his secrets in pickwick overdose of milk punch we are to ﬁnd ultimately clue to the labyrinth of mystic theology by his own test we are enabled to place arthur machen greatest works on the shelf with don quixote and pantagruel by his own test we ﬁnd the ecstasy of which he speaks in his own pages under the symbol of the vine and under ﬁgures even more beautiful and terrible minor consideration he ﬁnds in rabelais another symbolism of ecstasy the shape of gauloiserie of gross exuberant gaiety expressing itself by outrageous tales outrageous words by very cataract of obscenity if the project gutenberg ebook of arthur machen by vincent starrett https if only you will notice how the obscenity of rabelais transcends the obscenity of common life his grossne ss is poured out in sort of mad torrent in frenzy very passion of the unspeakable in cervantes he ﬁnds the greater deftness the ﬁner artiﬁce but he believes the conception of rabelais the higher because it is the more remote pantagruel more than frankness its ebullition of grossness is either the merest lunacy or else it is sublime and the paragraph that succeeds this one in the book perhaps it is part of the same paragraph sums up this astonishing philosophy with conclusion calculated to shock the puritanic thus you perceive that when certain depth has been passed you begin to ascend into the heights the persian poet expresses the most transcendental secrets of the divine love by the grossest phrases of the carnal love so rabelais soars above the common life above the streets and the gutter by going far lower than the streets and the gutter he brings before you the highest by positing that which is lower than the lowest and if you have the prepared initiated mind rabelaisian is the best preface to the angelic song all this may strike you extreme paradox but it has the disadvantage of being true and perhaps you may assure yourself of its truth by recollecting the converse it is when one is absorbed in the highest emotions that the most degrading images will intrude themselves and so on the sense of the futility almost of attempting to explain machen becomes more pronounced i progress you will have to read him you will ﬁnd his books if you are fortunate in murky corner of some obscure bookshop arthur machen was born in wales in he is married and has two children that is an astonishing thought after reading the inmost light it is surprising indeed to learn that he was born he is high church with partic ular respect the archbishop of canterbury and necessarily subconsciously catholic must be all those lonely awful souls who write ecstasy across the world he hates puritanism with sturdier hatred than inspires chesterton brilliant expo sition of this aversion i commend readers to his mocking introduction to the house of souls that work the hill of dreams and hieroglyphics were written between 1890 and 1900 after which their author turned strolling player and alternated time between the smartest theatres in london and the shabbiest music halls in london east end the last six years or so he has been descriptive writer on the london evening news his works not before mentioned comprise translation the best of the heptameron fantastic tales collection of mediaeval whimsies partly translated and partly original and altogether rabelaisian and delightful the terror shilling shocker his own characterization but ﬁner work withal than most of the literature of the day and the great return an extraordinary short tale which may ﬁnd place some day in another such collection the house of souls i have mentioned the chronicle of clemendy calling it classic and something further should be said about that astonishing book it is the welsh heptameron chronicle of amorous intrigue joyous drunkenness and knightly endeavor second to none in the brief muster of the world greatest classics in it there is the veritable ﬂavour of mediaeval record somewhat less outspoken than balzac in his droll stories and less verbose than boccaccio machen proves himself the peer of either in gay irresponsible diverting unﬂagging invention while his diction is lovelier than that of any of his forerunners including the nameless authors of those rich arabian tapestries which were the parent tales of all mediaeval and modern facetiae the day is coming when number of serious charges will be laid against us who live in this generation and some severe questio ns asked and the fact that we will be dead the project gutenberg ebook of arthur machen by vincent starrett https us when the future ﬁres its broadside has nothing at all to with the case we are going to be asked why we allowed ambrose bierce to vanish from our midst unnoticed and unsought after ignoring him shamefully throughout his career why stephen crane after few ﬂamboyant reviews was so quickly forgotten at death why richard middleton was permitted to swallow his poison at brussels why morrow and walter blackburn harte were in our day known only to the initiated discriminating few their ﬁne golden books merely rare items the collector among other things posterity is going to demand of us why when the opportunity was ours we did not open our hearts to arthur machen and name him among the very great i have let this last assertion stand part of the original article although machen writes that i am in error i never read line of baudelaire he says but i have read deeply in poe who i believe derives largely from baudelaire of course it is the other way baudelaire derives from poe but my own assumption is rendered the remembrance of the bard in the darkness of old age let not my memory fail let not get to celebrate the beloved land of gwent if they imprison in deep place in house of pestilence still shall i be free remembering the sunshine upon mynydd maen there have i listened to the song of the lark

mountain adorned with the gushing of many sweet is the shade of its hazel thickets there treasure is preserved which i will not celebrate it is glorious and deeply concealed if teils should return if happiness were restored to the cymri dewi and dyfrig should serve his mass then great marvel would be made visible blessed and miraculous work then should my bliss be the joy of angels i had rather
