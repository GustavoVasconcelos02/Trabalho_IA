their nests and warbled in its boughs and so became and multiplied more than ever it was an in the history of their race the downy woodpecker found such savory morsel under its bark that he perforated it in ring quite round the tree before he left it thing which he had never done before to my knowledge it did not take the partridge long to ﬁnd out how sweet its buds were and every winter eve she

frequently tempted to turn and linger near some more than usually handsome one whose blossoms are expanded how superior it is in these respects to the pear whose blossoms are neither colored nor fragrant by the middle of july green apples are so large to remind us of coddling and of the autumn the sward is commonly strewed with little ones which fall it were nature thus thinning them us the roman writer palladius said if apples are inclined to fall before their time stone placed in split root will retain them some such notion still surviving may account some of the stones which we see placed to be overgrown in the forks of trees they have saying in suf folk england at michaelmas time or little before half an apple goes to the core early apples begin to be ripe about the ﬁrst of august but i think that none of them are so good to eat some to smell one is worth more to scent your handkerchief with than any perfume which they sell in the shops the fragrance of some fruits is not to be forgotten along with that of ﬂowers some gnarly apple which i pick up in the road reminds by its fragrance of all the wealth of pomona forward to those days when they will be collected in golden and ruddy heaps in the orchards and about the cider week or two later you are going by orchards or gardens especially in the evenings you pass through little region possessed by the fragrance of ripe apples and thus enjoy them without price and without robbing anybody there is thus about all natural products certain volatile and ethereal quality which represents their highest value and whic h can not be vulgarized or bought and sold mortal has ever enjoyed the perfect ﬂavor of any fruit and only the among men begin to taste its ambrosial qualities nectar and ambrosia are only those ﬁne ﬂavors of every earthly fruit which our coarse palates fail to perceive we occupy the heaven of the gods without knowing it when i see particularly mean man carrying load of fair and fragrant early apples to market i seem to see contest going on between him and his horse on the one side and the apples on the other and to my mind the apples always gain it pliny says that apples are the heaviest of all things and that the oxen begin to sweat at the mere sight of load of them our driver begins to lose his load the moment he tries to transport them to where they not belong that is to any but the most beautiful though he gets out from time to time and feels of them and thinks they are all there i see the stream of their evanescent and celestial qualities going to heaven from his cart while the pulp and skin and core only are going to market they are not apples but pomace are not these still iduna apples the taste of which keeps the gods forever young and think you that they will let loki or thjassi carry them off to jötunheim while they grow wrinkled and gray ragnarök or the destruction of the gods is not yet there is another thinning of the fruit commonly near the end of august or in september when the ground is strewn with windfalls and this happens especially when high winds occur after rain in some orchards you may see fully of the whole crop on the ground lying

are more distinct on the trees i saw one year in neighboring town some trees fuller of fruit than i remembered to have ever seen before small yellow apples hanging over the road the branches were gracefully drooping with their weight like so that the whole tree acquired new character even the topmost branches instead of standing erect spread and drooped in all directions and there were so many poles supporting the lower ones that they looked like pictures of an old english manuscript says the mo appelen the tree bereth the more sche boweth to the folk surely the apple is the noblest of fruits let the most beautiful or the swiftest have it that should be the going price of apples between the ﬁfth and twentieth of october i see the barrels lie under the trees and perhaps i talk with one who is selecting some choice barrels to fulﬁl an order he turns specked one over many times before he leaves it out if i were to tell what is passing in my mind i should say that every one was specked which he had handled he rubs off all the bloom and those fugacious ethereal qualities leave it cool evenings prompt the farmers to make haste and at length i see only the ladders here and there left leaning against the trees it would be well if we accepted these gifts with more joy and gratitude and did not think it enough simply to put fresh load of compost about the tree some old english customs are suggestive at least i ﬁnd them described chieﬂy in brand popular antiquities it appears that on christmas eve the farmers and their men in devonshire take large bowl of cider with toast in it and carrying it in state to the orchard they salute the with much ceremony in order to make them bear well the next season this salutation consists in throwing some of the cider about the roots of the tree placing bits of the toast on the branches and then encircling one of the best bearing trees in the orchard they drink the following toast three several times to thee old whence thou mayst bud and whence thou mayst blow and whence thou mayst bear apples enow bushel bushel and my pockets full too hurra also what was called used to be practised in various counties of england on ear

them to sing better than english phillips did else they will credit to their muse the wild apple so much the more civilized urbanior es pliny calls them i love better to go through the old orchards of ungrafte d at whatever season of the year irregularly planted sometimes two trees standing close together and the rows so devious that you would think that they not only had grown while the owner was sleeping but had been set out by him in somnambulic state the rows of grafted fruit will never tempt to wander amid them like these but i now alas speak rather from memory than from any recent experience such ravages have been made some soils like rocky tract called the easterbrooks country in my neighborhood are so suited to the apple that it will grow faster in them without any care or if only the ground is broken up once year than it will in many places with any amount of care the owners of this tract allow that the soil is excellent fruit but they say that it is so rocky that they have not patience to plough it and that together with the distance is the reason why it is not cultivated there are or were recently extensive orchards there standing without order nay they spring up wild and bear well there in the midst of pines birches maples and oaks i am often surprised to see rising amid these trees the rounded tops of glowing with red or yellow fruit in harmony with the autumnal tints of the forest going up the side of cliff about the ﬁrst of november i saw vigorous young which planted by birds or cows had shot up amid the rocks and open woods there and had now much fruit on it uninjured by the frosts when all cultivated apples were gathered it was rank wild growth with many green leaves on it still and made an impression of thorniness the fruit was hard and green but looked if it would be palatable in the winter some was dangling on the twigs but more in the wet leaves under the tree or rolled far down the hill amid the rocks the owner knows nothing of it the day was not observ ed when it ﬁrst blossomed nor when it ﬁrst bore fruit unless by the chickadee there was dancing on the green beneath it in its honor and now there is hand to pluck its fruit which is only gnawed by squirrels i perceive it has done double duty only borne this crop but each twig has grown foot into the air and this is such fruit bigger than many berries we must admit and carried home will be sound and palatable next spring what care i iduna apples so long i can get these the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of

rugged and woody has grown an not planted by man relic of former orchard but natural growth like the pines and oaks most fruits which we prize and use depend entirely on our care corn and grain potatoes peaches melons depend altogether on our planting but the apple emulates man independence and enterprise it is not simply carried i have said but like him to some extent it has migrated to this new world and is even here and there making its way amid the aboriginal trees just the ox and dog and horse sometimes run wild and maintain themselves even the sourest and crabbedest apple growing in the most unfavorable position suggests such thoughts these it is so noble fruit the crab nevertheless our wild apple is wild only like myself perchance who belong not to the aboriginal race here but have strayed into the woods from the cultivated stock wilder still i have said there grows elsewhere in this country native and aboriginal crab malus coronaria whose nature has not yet been modiﬁed by cultivation it is found from western ork to minnesota and southward michaux says that its ordinary heigh t is ﬁfteen or eighteen feet but it is sometimes found or thirty feet high and that the large ones exactly resemble the common the ﬂowers are white mingled with and are collected in corymbs they are remarkable their delicious odor the fruit according to him is about an inch and half in diameter and is intensely acid yet they make ﬁne sweetmeats and also cider of them he concludes that if on being cultivated it does not yield new and palatable varieties it will at least be celebrated the beauty of its ﬂowers and the sweetness of its perfume i never saw the till may i had heard of it through michaux but more modern botanists so far i know have not treated it of any peculiar impo rtance thus it was tree to i contemplated pilgrimage to the glades portion of pennsylvania where it was said to grow to perfection i thought of sending to nursery it but doubted if they had it or would distinguish it from european varieties at last i had occasion to go to minnesota and on entering michigan i began to notice from the cars tree with handsome ﬂowers at ﬁrst i thought it some variety of thorn but it was not long before the truth ﬂashed on that this was my it was the prevailing ﬂowering shrub or tree to be seen from the cars at that season of the year the middle of may

soil is favorable to them i know of trees which have more difﬁculties to contend with and which more sturdily resist their foes these are the ones whose story we have to tell it oftentimes reads thus near the beginning of may we notice little thickets of just springing up in the pastures where cattle have been the rocky ones of our easter country or the top of nobscot hill in sudbury one or two of these perhaps survive the drought and other accidents very birthplace defending them against the encroaching grass and some other dangers at ﬁrst in two years time had thus reached the level of the rocks admired the stretching world nor feared the wandering ﬂocks but at this tender age its suf ferings began there came browsing ox and cut it down span this time perhaps the ox does not notice it amid the grass but the next year when it has grown more stout he recognizes it from the old country the ﬂavor of whose leaves and twigs he well knows and though at ﬁrst he pauses to welcome it and express his surprise and gets answer the same cause that brought you here brought he nevertheless browses it again reﬂecting it may be that he has some title to it thus cut down annually it does not despair but putting forth two short twigs every one cut off it spreads out low along the ground in the hollows or between the rocks growing more stout and scrubby until it forms not tree yet but little pyramidal stiff twiggy mass almost solid and impenetrable rock some of the densest and most impen etrable clumps of bushes that i have ever seen well on account of the closeness and stubbornness of their branches of their thorns have been these scrubs they are more like the scrubby ﬁr and black spruce on which you stand and sometimes walk on the tops of mountains where cold is the demon they contend with than anything else wonder they are prompted to grow thorns at last to defend themselves against such foes in their thorniness however there is malice only some malic acid the rocky pastures of the tract i have referred they maintain their ground best in rocky thickly sprinkled with these little tufts reminding you often of some rigid gray mosses or lichens and you see thousands of little trees just springing up between them with the seed still attached to them being regularly clipped all around each year by the cows hedge with shears they are often of perfect conical or pyramidal form from one to four feet high and more or less sharp if trimmed by the gardener art in the pastures on nobscot hill and its spurs they make ﬁne dark shadows when the sun is low they are also an excellent covert from hawks the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https birds that roost and build in them whole ﬂocks perch in them at night and i have seen three robins nests in one which was six feet in diameter doubt many of these are already old trees if you reckon from the day they were planted but infants still when you consider their development and the long life before them i counted the annual rings of some which were just one foot high and wide high and found that they were about twelve years old but quite sound and thrifty they were so low that they were unnoticed by the walker while many of their contemporaries from the nurseries were already bearing considerable crops but what you gain in time is perhaps in this case too lost in power is in the vigor of the tree this is their pyramidal state the cows continue to browse them thus twenty years or more keeping them down and compelling them to spread until at last they are so broad that they become their own fence when some interior shoot which their foes can not reach darts upward with joy it has not forgotten its high calling and bears its own peculiar fruit in triumph such are the tactics by which it ﬁnally defeats its bovine foes now if you have watched the progress of particular shrub you will see that it is longer simple pyram id or cone but that out of its apex there rises sprig or two growing more lustily perchance than an tree since the plant now devotes the whole of its repressed energy to these upright parts in short time these become small tree an inverted pyramid resting on the apex of the other so that the whole has now the form of vast the spreading bottom having served its purpose ﬁnally disappears and the generous tree permits the now harmless cows to come in and stand in its shade and rub against and redden its trunk which has grown in spite of them and even to taste part of its fruit and so disperse the seed thus the cows create their own shade and food and the tree its being inverted lives second life it were it is an important question with some nowadays whether you should trim young high your nose or high your eyes the ox trims them up high he can reach and that is about the right height i think in spite of wandering kine and other adverse circumstances that despised shrub valued only by small birds covert and shelter from hawks has its at last and in course of time its harvest sincere though small by the end of some october when its leaves have fallen i frequently see such central sprig whose progress i have watched when i thought it had forgotten its destiny i had bearing its ﬁrst crop of small green or yellow or rosy fruit which the cows can not get at over the bushy and thorny hedge which surrounds it and i make haste to taste the new and undescribed variety we have all heard of the numerous varieties of fruit invented by van mons and knight this is the system of van cow and she has invented far more and more memorable varieties than both of them through what hardships it may attain to bear sweet fruit though somewhat small it may prove equal if not superior in ﬂavor to that which has grown in garden perchance be all the sweeter and more palatable the very difﬁculties it has had to contend with who knows but this chance wild fruit

disguise what lesson to man so are human beings referred to the highest standard the celestial fruit which they suggest and aspire to bear browsed on by fate and only the most persistent and strongest genius defends itself and prevails sends tender scion upward at last and drops its perfect fruit on the ungrateful earth poets and philosophers and statesmen thus spring up in the country pastures and outlast the hosts of unoriginal men such is always the pursuit of knowledge the celestial fruits the golden apples of the hesperides are ever guarded by dragon which never sleeps so that it is an herculean labor to pluck them this is one and the most remarkable way in which the wild apple is propagated but commonly it springs up at wide intervals in woods and swamps and by the sides of roads the soil may suit it and grows with comparative rapidity those which grow in dense woods are very tall and slender i frequently pluck from these trees perfectly mild and tamed fruit palladius says et injussu consternitur ubere mali and the ground is strewn with the fruit of an unbidden it is an old notion that if these wild trees not bear valuable fruit of their own they are the best stocks by

wonder that these small and apples are thought to make the best cider loudon quotes from the herefordshire report that apples of small size are always if equal in quality to be preferred to those of larger size in order that the rind and kernel may bear the greatest proportion to the pulp which affords the weakest and most watery juice and he says that to prove this symonds of hereford about the year 1800 made one hogshead of cider entirely from the rinds and cores of apples and another from the pulp only when the ﬁrst was found of extraordinary strength and ﬂavor while the latter was sweet and insipid evelyn says that the was the favorite cider in his day and he quotes one newbur g saying in jersey is general observation i hear that the more of red any apple has in its rind the more proper it is this use apples they exclude much may be from their cider this opinion still prevails all apples are good in november those which the farmer leaves out unsalable and unpalatable to those

fed well housed well clothed well provided with religion contented and had wish to leave their owners now nicholas was not strong at spinning sham reason nor subtle at weaving false conscience but to his mind the very fact that the system had so degraded man that he could laugh and dance and sing while other men took his wages and wife and homestead was the crowning ar gument against the the

dropping of grains of salt into putrid sea but at last in 1842 nicholas issued his ukase creating the class of contracting peasants masters and serfs were empowered to enter into contracts serf

nearly spoiled what little good was hidden in the ukase notice after notice was given to the that they were not to be molested that emancipation was contemplated and that the ukase contained nothing

this day the remains undecided the tzar offers gradual indemnity the nobles seem to prefer ﬁre and blood alexander stands ﬁrm the last declaration brought across the water was that he would persist in reforms but whatever the after the serfs are free the career before russia is hopeful indeed emancipation of her serfs has set her fully in that career the vast mass of her inhabitants are of noble breed combining the sound mind of the races with the tough muscle of the northern plateaus of asia in other country on earth is there such unity in language in degree of cultivation and in basis of

education through the whole mass leaders of their hamlets and communities are voted bodies of peasants settle the partition of land and assessments in public meetings discussions are held votes are taken and though tzar right and nobles right are considered far above people right yet this rude democratic schooling is sure to keep bright in the people some sparks of manliness and some glow of free thought in view too of many words and acts of the present emperor it is not too much to hope that ere many years russia will become constitutional monarchy so shall russia be made power before

standing at the between the past and present his gaze is ever ﬁxed upon the path along which creation has moved and he travels back recovering step by step the road that has been lost to man in apparently impenetrable darkness and mystery the light brightens and broadens before him and seems to tempt him on into the dim regions where the great mystery of creation lies hidden before the year 1800 men had never suspected that their home had been tenanted in past times by set of beings totally different from those that inhabit it now still farther was it from their thought to imagine that creation after creation had followed each other in successive ages every one stamped with character peculiarly its own it was cuvier who aroused to new labors by the hint he received from the bones unearthed at montmartre to which all his vast knowledge of living animals gave him clue established by means of most laborious investigations the astounding conclusion that prior to the existence of the animals and plants now living this globe had been the theatre of another set of beings every trace of whom had vanished from the face of the earth to his alert and active intellect and powerful imagination word spoken out of the past was pregnant with meaning and when he had once convinced himself that he had found single animal that had counterpart among living beings it gave him the key to many mysteries it may be doubted whether men eyes are ever opened to truths which though new to them are old to god till the time has come when they can apprehend their meaning and turn them to good account it certainly seems that when such revelation has once been made light pours in upon it from every side and this is especially true of the case in point the existence of past creation once suggested conﬁrmation was found in thousand facts overlooked the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https solid crust of the earth gave up its dead and from the snows of siberia from the soil of italy from caves of central europe from mines from the rent sides of mountains and from their highest peaks from the coral beds of ancient oceans the varied animals that had possessed the earth ages before man was created spoke to us of the past sooner were these facts established than the relation between the extinct world and the world of became the subject of extensive researches and comparisons innumerable theories were started to account the differences and to determine the periods and manner of the change it is not my intention to enter now at any length upon the subject of geological succession though i hope to return to it hereafter in series of papers upon that and kindred topics but i allude to it here before presenting some views upon the maintenance of organic types they exist in our own period the following reason since it has been shown that from the beginning of creation till the present time the physical history of the world has been divided into succession of distinct periods each one accompanied by its characteristic animals and plants so that our own epoch is only the closing one in the long procession of the ages naturalists have been constantly striving to ﬁnd the connecting link betwee n them all and to prove that each such creation has been normal and natural growth out of the preceding one with this aim they have tried to adapt the phenomena of reproduction among animals to the problem of creation and to make the beginning of life in the individual solve that great mystery of the beginning of life in the world in other words they have endeavored to show that the fact of successive generations is analogous to that of successive creations and that the processes by which animals once created are maintained unchanged during the period to which they belong will account also their primitive existence i wish at the outset to forestall any such misapplication of the facts i am about to state and to impress upon my readers the difference between these two subjects of inquiry it by means follows that because individuals are endowed with the power of reproducing and perpetuating their kind they are in any sense still less probable does this appear when we consider that since man has existed upon the earth appreciable change has taken place in the animal or vegetable world and so far our knowledge goes this would seem to be equally true of all the periods preceding ours each one maintaining unbroken to its close the or ganic character impressed upon it at the beginning the question i propose to consider here is simply the mode by which organic types are preserved they exist at present every one has summary answer to this question in the statement that all these individuals reproduce themselves and thus maintain their kinds but the modes of reproduction are so varied the changes some animals under go during their growth so extraordinary the pheno mena accompanying these changes so startling that in the pursuit of the subject new and independent of grown up of the utmost importance in the present state of our knowledge the prevalent ideas respecting the reproduction of animals are made up from the daily observation of those immediately about us in the and the farm but the phenomena here are comparatively simple and easily traced the moment we extend our observations beyond our cattle and fowls and enter upon wider ﬁeld of investigation we are met by the most startling facts not the least bafﬂing of these are the disproportionate numbers of males and females in certain kinds of animals their unequal development well the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https difference between the sexes among certain species so that they seem distinct from each other if they belonged to separate groups of the animal kingdom we have close at hand one of the most striking instanc es of disproportionate numbers in the household of the bee with its one fertile female charged with the perpetuation of the whole community while her innumerable sterile sisterhood amid few hundred drones work its support in other ways another most interesting chapter connected with the maintenance of animals is found in the various ways and different degrees of care with which they provide their progeny some having fulﬁlled their whole duty toward their offspring when they have given them birth others seeking the eggs they have laid and watching with certain care over their development others feeding their young till they can provide themselves and building nests or burrowing holes in the ground or constructing earth mounds their shelter but whatever be the difference in the outward appearance or the habits of animals one thing is common to them all without exception at some period of their lives they produce eggs which being fertilized give rise to beings of the same kind the parent this mode of generation is universal and is based upon that harmonious antagonism between the sexes that contrast between the male and the female element that at once divides and unites the whole animal kingdom and although this exchange of inﬂuence is not kept up by an equality of numeric relations not only are the sexes very unequally divided in some kinds of animals but the male and female elements are even combined in certain types so that the individuals are uniformly hermaphrodites i ﬁrmly believe that this numerical distribution however unequal it may seem to us is not without its ordained accuracy and balance he who has assigned its place to every leaf in the thickest forest according to an arithmetical law which prescribes to each its allotted share of room on the branch where it grows will not have distributed animal life with less care but although reproduction by eggs is common to all animals it is only one among several modes of multiplication we have seen that certain animals besides the ordin ary process of generation also increase their number naturally and constantly by so that out of one individual many individuals may arise by natural breaking up of the whole body into distinct surviving parts this process of normal may take place at all periods of life it may form an early phase of metamorphosis in the hydroid of our common aurelia described in the last article or it may even take place before the young is formed in the egg in such case the egg itself divides into number of portions two four eight or even twelve and sixteen individuals being normally developed from every egg in conse quence of this singular process of segmentation of the yolk takes place indeed in all eggs but in those which produce but one individual is only stage in the natural growth of the yolk during its transformation into young embryo the facts here alluded to are not very familiar even to professional naturalists i may be permitted to describe them more in detail one who has often walked across in summer can have failed to remark what the children call sand saucers the name is not bad one with the exception that the saucer lacks bottom but the form of these circular bands of sand is certai nly very like saucer with the bottom knocked out hold one of them against the light and you will see that it is composed of countless transparent spheres each of the size of small pin head these are the eggs of our common natica or any one who remembers the outline of this shell will easily understand the process by which its eggs are left lying on the beach in the form the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https described they are laid in the shape of broad short ribbon pressed between the mantle and the shell and passing out cover the outside of the shell over which they are rolled up with kind of glutinous envelope the eggs are held together by soft glutinous substance thus surrounded the shell by its natural movements along the beach soon collects the sand upon it the particles of which in contact with the glutinous substance of the eggs quickly forms cement that binds the whole together in kind of paste when consolidated it drops off from the shell having taken the mould of its form it were and retaining the curve which distinguishes the outline of the natica although these saucers look perfectly round it will be found that the edges are not soldered together but are simply lapped one over the other every one of the thousand little spheres crowded into such circle of sand contains an egg if we follow the development of these eggs we shall presently ﬁnd that each one divides into two halves these again dividing to make four portions then the four breaking up into eight and so on till we may have the yolks divided into less than sixteen distinct parts thus far this process of segmentation is similar to that of the egg in other animals but we shall see hereafter it seems usually to result only in change in the quality of its substance the portions coalesce again to form one mass from which new individual is ﬁnally sketched out at ﬁrst simple embryo and gradual ly under going all the changes peculiar to its kind till animal escapes from the egg but in the case of the natica this regular segmentation changes its character and at certain period in more or less advanced stage of the segmentation according to the species each portion of the yolk assumes an individuality of its own and instead of uniting again with the rest begins to subdivide itself in our natica heros instance the common large gray of our coast this change takes place when the yolk has subdivided into eight parts at that time each portion begins life of its own not reuniting with its seven twin portions so that in the end instead of single embryo growing out of this yolk we have eight embryos arising from single yolk each one of which under goes series of developments similar in all respects to that by which single embryo is formed from each egg in other animals we have other naticas in which the normal number is twelve others again in which less than sixteen individuals arise from one yolk but this process of segmentation though in these animals it leads to such multiplication of individuals is exactly the same that discovered by von baer in the egg of the frog and described and ﬁgured by professor bischof in the egg of the rabbit the dog the and the deer while other embryologist s have traced the same process in birds reptiles and fishes well in variety of articulates mollusks and radiates multiplication by division occurs also normally in adult animals that have completed their growth this is especially frequent among worms and strange to say there are species in this class which never lay eggs before they have already multiplied themselves by another mode of increase is that by budding in the corals and many other radiates the most common instance of budding we not however generally associate with this mode of multiplication in the animal kingdom because we are so little accustomed to compare and generalize upon phenomena that we not see to be directly connected with one another i allude here to the budding of trees which year after year enlar ge by the addition of new individuals arising from buds i trust that the usual acceptation of the word individual used in science simply to designate singleness of existence will not obscure correct appreciation of the true relation of buds to their parents and to the beings arising from them these buds have the same organic signiﬁcance whether they drop from the parent stock to become the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https in the common acceptation of the term or remain connected with the parent stock in corals and in trees thus forming growing communities of combined individuals nor will it matter much in connection with the subject under discussion whether these buds start from the surface of an animal or sprout in its interior to be cast off in due time neither is the inequality of buds varying more or less among themselves any sound reason overlooking their essential identity of structure we have seen instances of this among acalephs and it is still more apparent among trees which produce simultaneously leaf and ﬂower and even separate male and female ﬂower is the case with our hazels oaks etc it is not however my purpose here to describe the various modes of reproduction and multiplication among animals and plants nor to discuss the merits of the different opinions respecting their numeric increase according to which some persons hold that all types originated from few primitive individuals while others believe that the very numbers now in existence are part of the primitive plan and essential to the harmonious relations existing between the animal and vegetable world i would only attempt to show that in the plan of creation the maintenance of types has been secured through variety of means but under such limitations that within narrow range of individual differences all representatives of one kind of animals agree with one another whether derived from eggs or produced by natural division or by budding and that the constancy of these normal processes of reproduction well the uniformity of their results precludes the idea that the speciﬁc differences among animals have been produced by the very means that secure their permanence of type the statement itself implies contradiction it tells us that the same inﬂuences prevent and produce change in the condition of the animal kingdom facts are all against it there is not fact known to science by which any single being in the natural process of reproduction and multiplication has diver ged from the course natural to its kind or in which single kind has been transformed into any other but this once established and setting aside the idea that embryology is to explain to us the origin well the maintenance of life it yet has most important lessons us and the ﬁeld it covers is constantly enlar ging the study is pursued the ﬁrst and most important result of the science of embryology was one which the scientiﬁc world was wholly unprepared down to our own century nothing could have been farther from the conception of anatomists and physiologists than the fact now generally admitted that all animals without exception arise from eggs though linnaeus had already expressed this great truth in the sentence so often quoted omne vivum ex ovo he was not himself aware of the signiﬁcance of his own statement the existence of the mammalian egg was not then dreamed of since then the discoveries of von baer and others have shown not only that the egg is common to all living beings without exception from the lowest radiate to the highest vertebrate but that its structure is at ﬁrst identical in all composed of the same primitive elements and under going exactly the same process of growth up to the time when it assumes the special character peculiar to its kind this is unquestionably one of the most comprehensive generalizations of modern times in common parlance we understand by an egg something of the nature of hen egg mass of yolk surrounded with white and inclosed in shell but to the naturalist the envelopes of the egg which vary greatly in different animals are mere accessories while the true egg or it is called the ovarian egg with which the life of every living being begins is minute sphere uniform in appearance throughout the animal kingdom though its intimate structure is hardly to be reached even with the highest powers of the microscope some account of the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https stages of growth in the egg may not be uninteresting to my readers i will take the egg of the turtle an illustration since that has been the subject of my own especial study but i not intend to carry my remarks beyond the period during which the history of all vertebrate eggs is the same they may be considered of more general application it is well known that all organic structu res whether animal or vegetable are composed of cells these cells consist of an outside bag inclosing an inner sac and within that sac there is dot the outer bag is ﬁlled with ﬂuid the inner one with perfectly transparent ﬂuid while the dot is dark and distinct in the language of our science the outer envelope is called the ectoblast the inner sac the mesoblast and the dot the entoblast although they are peculiarly modiﬁed to suit the different organs these cells never lose this peculiar structure it may be traced even in the long cells of the ﬂesh which are like mere threads but yet have their outer and inner sac and their dot least while forming in the turtle the ovary is made up of such cells spherical at ﬁrst but becoming hexagonal under pressure when they are more closely packed together between these ovarian cells the egg originates and is at ﬁrst mere granule so minute that when placed under very high magnifying power it is but just visible this is the incipient egg and at this stage it differs from the surrounding cells only in being somewhat darker like drop of oil and opaque instead of transparent and clear like the surrounding cells under the microscope it is found to be composed of two substances only namely oil and albumen it increases gradually and when it has reached size at which it requires to be magniﬁed one thousand times in order to be distinctly visible the outside assumes the aspect of membrane thicker than the interior and forming coating around it this is owing not to an addition from outside but to change in the consistency of the substance at the surface which becomes more closely united more compact than the loose mass in the centre presently we perceive bright luminous transparent spot on the upper side of the egg near the wall or outer membrane this is produced by concentration of the albumen which now separates from the oil and collects at the upper side of the egg forming this light spot called by naturalists the purkinjean vesicle after its discoverer purkinje when this albuminous spot becomes somewhat larger there arises little dot in the centre germinal dot it is called and now we have perfect differing from an ordinary cell only in having the inner sac inclosing the dot on the side instead of in the centre the outer membrane corresponds to the ectoblast or outer cell sac the purkinjean vesicle to the mesoblast or inner cell sac while the dot in the centre answers to the entoblast when the purkinjean vesicle has completed its growt h it bursts and disappears but the mass contained in it remains in the same region and retains the same character though longer inclosed before at later stage of the investigation we see why the purkinjean vesicle or inner sac of the egg is placed on the side instead of being at the centre in the cell it arises on that side along which the axis of the little turtle is to lie opposite side being that corresponding to the lower part of the body thus the lighter more delicate part of the substance of the egg is collected where the upper cavity of the animal inclosing the nervous system and brain is to be while the heavy oily part remains beneath where the lower cavity inclosing all the organs of mere material animal existence is afterwards developed in other words when the egg is mere mass of oil and albumen not indicating yet in any way the character of the future animal and discernible only by the microscope the distinction is indicated between the the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https the senses between the organs of instinct and sensation and those of mere animal functions at that stage of its existence however when the egg consists of an outer sac an inner sac and dot its resemblance to cell is unmistakable and in fact an egg when forming is nothing but single cell this comparison is important because there are both animals and plants which during their whole existence consist of single organic cell while others are made up of countless millions of such cells between these two extremes we have all degrees from the innumerable cells that build up the body of the highest vertebrate to the worm and from the myriad cells of the oak to the alga but while we recognize the identity of and at this point in the history of the egg we must not forget the great distinction between them that while the cells remain component parts of the whole body the egg separates itself and assumes distinct individual existence even now while still microscopically small its individuality begins other substances collect around it are absorbed into it nourish it serve it every being is centre about which many other things cluster and conver ge and which has the power to assimilate to itself the necessary elem ents of its life every egg is already such centre differing from the cells that surround it by material elements but by the principle of life in which its individuality consists which is to make it new being instead of with those that build up the body of the parent animal and remain component parts of it this intangible something is the subtile element that eludes our closest analysis it is the germ of the immaterial principle according to which the new being is to develop the physical germ we see the spiritual germ we can not see though we may trace its action on the material elements through which it is expressed the ﬁrst change in the yolk after the formation of the purkinjean vesicle is the appearance of minute dots near the wall at the side opposite the vesicle these increase in number and size but remain always on that half of the yolk leaving the other half of the globe clear one can hardly conceive the beauty of the egg seen through the microscope at this period of its growth when the whole yolk is divided with the dark granules on one side while the other side where the transparent halo of the vesicle is seen is brilliant with light with the growth of the egg these granules enlar ge become more distinct and under the microscope some of them appear to be hollow they are not round in form but rather irregular and under the effect of light they are exceedingly brilliant presently instead of being scattered equally over the space they occupy they form clusters it were between these clusters are clear spaces produced by the separation of the albumen from the oil at this period of its growth there is wonderful resemblance between the appearance of the egg seen under the microscope and the ﬁrmament with the celestial bodies the little clusters or constellations are unequally divided here and there they are two and two like double stars or sometimes in threes or ﬁves or in sevens recalling the pleiades and the clear albuminous tracks between are like the empty spaces separating the stars this is fanciful simile it is simply true that such is the actual appearance of the yolk at this time and the idea can not but suggest itself to the mind that the thoughts which have been at work in the universe are collected and repeated here within this little egg which offers us miniature diagram of the ﬁrmament this is one of the ﬁrst changes of the yolk ending the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https regular clusters with sort of of albumen between and then this phase of the growth is complete now the clusters of the yolk separate and next the albumen in its turn conc entrates into clusters and the dark bodies which have been till now the striking points give way to the lighter spheres of albumen between which the clusters are scattered presently the whole becomes redissolved these stages of the growth being completed this little system of worlds is melted it were but while it under goes this process the albuminous spheres after being dissolved arrange themselves in concentric rings alternating with rings of granu les around the purkinjean vesicle at this time we are again reminded of saturn and its rings which seems to have its counterpart here these rings disappear and now once more out of the yolk mass loom up little dots minute before but they are round instead of angular and those nearest the purkinjean vesicle are smaller and cleare r containing less of oil than the larger and darker ones on the opposite side from this time the yolk begins to take its color the oily cells assuming yellow tint while the albuminous cells near the vesicle become whiter up to this period the processes in the different cells seem to have been controlled by the different character of the substance of each but now it would seem that the changes become more independent of physical or materi al inﬂuences each kind of cell under goes the same process they all assume the ordinary cell character with outer and inner sac inner sac forming on the side like the purkinjean vesicle itself but it does not retain this position soon its wall is formed and it becomes distinct body it ﬂoats away from the side and takes its place in the centre next there arise within it number of little bodies crystalline in form and which actually are wax or oil crystals they increase with great rapidity the inner sac or mesoblast becoming sometimes so crowded with them that its shape is affected by the protrusion of their angles this process goes on till all the cells are so ﬁlled by the mesoblast with its myriad brood of cells that the outer sac or ectoblast becomes mere halo around it then every mesoblast contracts the contraction deepens till it is divided across in both directions separating thus into four parts then into eight then into sixteen and so on till every cell is crowded with hundreds of minute mesoblasts each containing the indicat ion of central dot or entoblast at this period every yolk cell is itself like whole yolk each cell is full of lesser cells the itself when the mesoblast has become thus inﬁnitely subdivided into hundreds of minute spheres the ectoblast bursts and the new generations of cells thus set free collect in that part of the egg where the embryonic disk is to arise this process of segmentation contin ues to go on downward till the whole yolk is taken in these myriad cells are in fact the component parts of the little turtle that is to be they will under go certain modiﬁcations to beco and so on adapting themselves to the different organs they are to build up but they have much their deﬁnite and appointed share in the formation of the body now at any later stage of its existence we are so accustomed to see life maintained through variety of complicated organs that we are apt to think this the only way in which it can be manifested and consideri ng how closely life and the organs through which it is expressed are united it is natural that we should believe them inseparably connected but embryological investigations have shown us that in the commencement none of these organs are formed and yet that the principle of life is active the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https even after they exist they can not act inclosed they are in the little chicken instance before it is hatched the lungs can not breathe they are surrounded by ﬂuid the senses are inactive they receive impressions from without and all those functions establishing its relations with the extern al world lie dormant yet they are not needed but they are there though we have seen in the turtle egg they were not there at the beginning how then are they formed we may answer that the ﬁrst function of every organ is to make itself the building material is it were provided by the process which divides the yolk into innumerable cells and by the gradual assimilation and modiﬁcation of this material the organs arise before the lungs breathe they make themselves before the stomach digests it makes itself before the organs of the senses act they make themselves before the brain thinks it makes itself in word before the whole system works it makes itself its ﬁrst ofﬁce is structure at the period described above however when the new generations of cells are just set free and have taken their place in the region where the new being is to develop nothing is to be seen of the animal whose life is beginning there except the ﬁlmy disk lying on the surface of the yolk next come the layers of white or albumen around the egg and last the shell which is formed from the lime in the albumen there is always more or less of lime in albumen and the hardening of the last layer of white into shell is owing only to the greater proportion of lime in its substance in the layer next to the shell there is enough of lime to consolidate it slightly and it forms membrane but the white the membrane and the shell have all the same quality except that the proportion of lime is more or less in the dif ferent layers but i have said the various envelopes of eggs the presence or absence of shell and the absolute size of the egg are accessory features belonging not to the egg egg but to the special kind of being from which the egg has arisen and into which it is to develop what is common to all eggs and essential to them all is that which corresponds to the yolk in the bird egg but their later mode of development the degree of perfection acquired by the egg and germ before being laid the term required the germ to come to maturity well the frequency and regularity of the broods are all features varying with the different kinds of animals there are those that lay eggs once year at particular season and then die so that their existence may be compared to that of annual plants under going their natural growth in season to exist during the remainder of the year only in the form of an egg or

souls utter and fewer understand is clear and vivid he renders it thus with whatever mastery of the mere material part he may possess ﬁngering dramatic effects etc these are but means to him not an

another in it this boy knows and is to that faithful witness his deaf uninstructed soul has never been tampered with by who know the body well enough of music but nothing of the living creature within the world is full of these vulgar souls that palter with eternal nature and the eternal arts blind to the word who dwells among us therein tom or the daemon in tom was not one of them with regard to his command of the instrument two points have been especially noted by musicians the unusual frequency of occurrence of tours force in his playing and the scientiﬁc precision of his manner of touch

with his back to the piano and made to play in that position favorite feat in his concerts the touch is always scientiﬁcally accurate the peculiar power which tom possesses however is one which requires scientiﬁc knowledge of music in his audiences to appreciate placed at the instrument with any musician he plays perfect bass accompaniment to the treble of music heard the ﬁrst time he plays then taking the seat vacated by the other performer he instantly gives the entire piece intact in brilliancy and symmetry not note lost or misplaced the selections of music by which this power of tom was tested two years ago were sometimes fourteen and sixteen pages in length on one occasion at an exhibition at the white house after long concert he was tried with two pieces thirteen the other twenty pages long and was successful we know of parallel case to this in musical history grimm tells us one of the most remarkable manifestations of mozart infant genius that at the age of nine he was required to give an accompaniment to an aria which he had never heard before and without notes there were false accords in the ﬁrst attempt he acknowledges but the second was pure when the music to which tom plays secondo is strictly classical he sometimes balks an instant in passages to otherwise would argue creative power equal to that of the master composers but when any chordant harmony runs through it on which the glowing negro soul can seize you know there are false accords with the infant mozart i wish to draw especial attention to this power of the boy not only because it is so far i know unmatched in the development of any musical talent but because considered in the context of his entire intellectual structure it involves curious problem the mere repetition of music heard but once even when in tom case it is given with such incredible ﬁdelity and after the the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics

the symphony in its current capacity to create in short yet such attempts tom has made to dictate music publication not sustain any such inference they are only few light marches gallops simple and plaintive enough but with easily detected traces of remembered harmonies very different from the strange weird improvisations of every day one would fancy that the mere attempt to bring this mysterious genius within him in bodily presence before the outer world woke too the idiotic nature to utter its reproachful unable cry nor is this the only bar by which poor tom soul is put in mind of its foul bestial prison after any too prolonged effort such those i have alluded to his whole bodily frame gives way and complete exhaustion of the brain follows accompanied with epileptic spasms the

score which he explained to be fantasia of his own composition never published this it was impossible the boy could have heard there could be trick of memory in this and on this trial triumphantly tom would fail the manuscript was some fourteen pages long on an inanimate theme oliver refused to submit the boy brain to so cruel test some of the audience even interfered but the musician insisted and took his place tom sat beside him head rolling nervously from side to side the opening cadence and then from the ﬁrst note to the last gave the secondo triumphantly jumping up he fairly shoved the man

was certainly better that they should learn to sing by rote the creed and the deﬁnitions of scientiﬁc terms and such like than to learn the profanity and obscenity of the streets which was the alternative but mother who wished anything which might be called the development of her child would think of putting it into an especially if she lived in the country amid the mighty sum of things

child of reason and in turn cultivates the intellectual principle to bring out order on the physical plane the kinder garten makes it serious purpose to organize romping and set it to music which cultivates the physical nature also romping is the ecstasy of the body and we shall ﬁnd that in proportion children tend to be violent they are vigorous in body there is always morbid weakness of some

is balanced by instincts of body which should have priority if they can not certainly be in full harmony the mind can afford to wait the maturing of the body it survives the body while the body can not afford to wait the mind but is irretrievably stunted if the nervous energy is not free to stimulate its special organs at least equally with those of the mind it is not however necessary to

garten and may be taken in short lessons of quarter of an hour or even of ten minutes children are fond of precision also and it will be found that they like the teaching best when they are made to the exercises exactly right and in perfect time to the music but the regular gymnastics and the romping plays must be alternated with quiet employments of course but still active they will sing at their plays by rote and also should be taught other songs by rote but there can be introduced regular drill on the scale which should never last more than ten minutes at time this if well managed will cultivate their ears and voices so that in the course of year they will become very expert in telling any note struck if not in striking it the ear is cultivated sooner than the voice and they may be taught to name the octave 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and their imaginations impressed by drawing ladder of eight rounds on the blackboard to signify that the voice rises by regular gradation this will ﬁx their

can be drawn them with lead pencil on the board by the teachers weaving strips of colored into papers cut them is another enchanting amusement and can be made subservient to teaching them the harmonies of colors in the latter part of the season when they have an accumulation of pricked birds or have learned to draw them they can be allowed colors to paint them in rough manner it is perhaps worth while to say that in teaching children to draw on their slates it is better the teacher to draw at the moment on the blackboard than to give them patterns of birds utensils because then the children will see how to begin and proceed and are not discouraged by the mechanical perfection of their model drawing ought always rather to precede reading and writing the minute appreciation of forms is the proper preparation these but reading and writing may come into kinder garten exercises at once if reading is taught by the phonic method which saves all perplexity to the child brain and

marks by the side of each other and join them on the top is what is it they sounded m and made three marks and joined them on the top with more or less success the teacher said now put your lips close together and say this is mute and to be whispered they all imitated the motion made she said now let us write it one straight mark then the upper lip puffed out at the top m and p to be written and

were sounded the italian way in the words and this teacher had miss peabody first nursery and when she had taught the class to make all the words on the ﬁrst page of it she gave each of the children the book and told them to ﬁnd ﬁrst one word and then another it was great pleasure to them to be told that now they could read they were encouraged to copy the words out of the book upon their slates the first nursery has in it words that have exceptions in their spelling to the sounds given to the children the powers of the letters nor has it any diphthong or combinations of letters such oi ch sh th after they could read it at sight they were told that all words were not so regular and their attention was called to the initial sounds of thin shin and chin and to the proper diphthongs oi and au and they wrote words considering these additional characters then mother goose was put into their hands and they were made to read by rote the songs they already knew by heart and to copy them it was great entertainment to ﬁnd the queer words and these were made the nucleus of groups of similar words which were written on the blackboard and copied on their slates we have thought it worth while to give in detail this method of teaching to read because it is the most entertaining to children to be taught so and because many successful instances of the pursual of this plan have come under our observation and one advantage of it has been that the children so taught though never going through the common spelling have uniformly exhibited rare exactness in orthography in going through this process the children learn to print very nicely and generally can so sooner than they can read it is small matter afterwards to teach them to turn the print into script they should be taught to write with the lead pencil before the pen whose use need not come into the kinder garten but we must not omit one of the most important exercises children in the kinder garten of froebel has four gifts of blocks ronge kinder garten guide has pages of royal octavo ﬁlled with engraved forms that can be made by variously laying eight little cubes and sixteen little planes two inches long one inch broad and an inch thick chairs tables stables sofas and innumerable forms of symmetry make an immense resource children who also should be led to invent other forms and imitate other objects so quick are the fancies of children that the blocks will serve also symbols of everything in nature and imagination we have seen an ingenious teacher assemble class of children around her large table to each of whom she had given the blocks the ﬁrst thing was to count them great process of arithmetic to most of them then she made something the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https it it was perhaps some blocks would represent rocks near it to be avoided and ships sailing in the ocean or perhaps it was with chickens inside and fox prowling about outside and boy who was going to catch the fox and save the fowls then she told each child to make something and when it was done hold up hand the ﬁrst one she asked to explain and then went round the class if one began to speak before another had ended she would hold up her ﬁnger and say it is not your turn in the course of the winter she taught over these blocks great deal about the habits of animals she studied natural history in order to be perfectly accurate in her symbolic representation of the habitation of each animal and their enemies were also represented by blocks the children imitated these and when they drew upon their imaginations facts and made fantastic creations she would say those i think were fairy hens or whatever it was her principle to accept everything and thus tempt out their invention the great value of this exercise is to get them into the habit of representing something they have thought by an outward symbol the explanations they are always eager to give teach them to express themselves in words full scope is given to invention whether in the direction of possibilities or of the impossibilities in which children imaginations revel either case the child being trained to the habit of embodiment of its thought froebel thought it very desirable to have garden where the children could cultivate ﬂowers he had one which he divided into lots the several children reserving portion his own share in which they could assist him he thought it the happiest mode of calling their attention to the invisible god whose power must be waited upon after the conditions growth are carefully arranged according to laws which they were to observe where garden is impossible ﬂowerpot with plant in it each child to take care of would very well but the best way to cultivate sense of the presence of god is to draw the attention to the conscience which is very active in children and which seems to them we all can testify from our own remembrance another than themselves and yet themselves we have heard person say that in her childhood she was puzzled to know which was herself the voice of her inclination or of her conscience they were palpably two and what joyous thing it was when she was ﬁrst convinced that one was the spirit of god whom unluck y teaching had previously embodied in form of terror on distant children are consecrated soon they get the spiritual idea and it may be so presented that it shall make them happy well true but the adult who enters into such conversation with child must be careful not to shock and profane instead of nurturing the soul it is possible to avoid both discouraging and ﬂattering views and to give the most tender and elevating associations but children require not only an alternation of physical and mental amusements but some instruction to be passively received they delight in stories and wise teacher can make this subservient to the highest uses by reading beautiful creations of the imagination not only such sanford and merton farrar robinson crusoe and salzmann elements of morality but symbolization like the heroes of asgard the legends of the middle ages classic and chivalric tales the legend of saint geor ge and pilgrim progress can in the mouth of skilful reader be made subservient to moral culture the reading sessions should not exceed

upon us all along because genius must move so slowly at ﬁrst but when he comes back he will be above us and oh how shall we know where to ﬁnd him you not mean that my boy will look down upon his mother said schroder raising herself in her chair look down upon us cried violet oh it is only the little that that that they may appear to be high the truly great never look down they are kneeling

abroad he has lived upon all these years only his daily bread but what his talent his genius whatever it is has fed itself with ernest is too unpractical to have been able even to feed himself and he knows it my poor ernest said schroder this is why he should be pitied it is hard generous nature to owe all to another it has weighed ernest down it has embittered the love of the two brothers but it is more bitter harry persisted violet all this time ernest could think of the grand return he could bring when his time should come but harry he brings the clay out of which ernest moulds the statue but the spirit that ernest breathes into the form harry understand it or appreciate it the body is very reverent of the soul but i think the spirit is not grateful enough to the body there comes time when it says to it i can without thee and spurns the kind comrade which has helped it on so far yet it could not have done without the joy of color and form of sight and hearing that the body has

ernest he went heavily about his work and the house seemed silent without him harry confessed this sadly to violet when his brother had been gone about year they had heard from ernest in florence that he was getting on well he had found occupation in the workshop of famous sculptor and had time besides to carry out some of his own designs he writes said harry that he will be able now to support

letter on the table harry saw that only it was violet letter which she wrote on leaving leghorn he tore it from its cover gave it opened to ernest you must read it can not and he hurried into an inner room ernest held the letter helplessly and looked round him there was double desolation in the room the books stood untouched upon the shelves his mother was laid aside suddenly there came back to him

confess it to myself or you i thought he was above us both and when i pitied myself that he could not love i pitied you and my pity perhaps i mistook love of you perhaps i mistook it i know not but i was conscious all the time of loving him i learned the truth when i stood by the side of his psyche and saw that though she hovered from the marble though he had won fame and success he was unsatisﬁed still it is true he must always remain unsatisﬁed because it is his genius that thirsts and it is my ideal that he loves not but he is dying he asks you never could refuse him what he asked the

communication our and enterprising said very coolly that they should like to see him it phrase intended to convey the idea that in their opinion he had promised great deal more than he could perform but cyrus was good his word the cable was laid and worked the space of three weeks conveying between the old and new world four hundred messages of all sorts and some of them of the greatest importance four years have elapsed since the fulﬁlment of that promise and now the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by

you may shrug your shoulders my friend and look incredulous but i assure you the grand idea will be realize d and speedily i have been heretofore incredulous any one but having examined the evidence in its favor i am fully convinced not only of the feasibility of laying cable and of the certainty of its practical operation when laid but of its complete indestructibility if you will accompany through the following pages my doubting friend i will convince you of the correctness of my conclusions when the fact of the successful laying of the old atlantic cable was known there was class of people in this country more surprised at the result than the electricians engineers and practical telegraphers meeting friend of mine an electrician and who by the way is also great mathematician and like all of his class inclined to be very exact in his statements i exclaimed in all the warmth and exuberance of feeling engendered by so great an event is it glorious this idea of being able to send our lightning across the ocean and to talk with london and paris readily we with new york and new orleans it is indeed responded my friend with equal enthusiasm my hopes are more than realized by this wonderful achievement hopes realized exclaimed i why i did consider there was one chance in thousand of success you why yes replied my exact mathem atical friend i did think the chances so much against the success of the enterprise that from the deductions which i drew from very careful examination of all the facts i could obtain i concluded that the chanc es of absolute failure were about and half per many of the facts contained in this article i am indebted to the very clear and able address delivered by mr cyrus field before the american geographical and statistical society at clinton hall new york in may last upon the prospects of the atlantic telegraph at the start of course every one was very ignorant of the work to be done in establishing telegraph across the ocean submarine telegraphy was in its infancy and aërial telegraphy had scarcely outgrown its we had to grope our way in the dark it was only by repeated experiments and repeated failures that we were able to ﬁnd out all the conditions of success the atlantic telegraph it is said by some was failure well if it were so replies field i should say is said of many man that he did more by his death than by his life that even in its failure it has been of immense beneﬁt to the science of the world it has been the great experimenting cable electrician ever had so long line to work upon before and hence the science of submarine telegraphy never made such rapid progress after that great experiment in fact all cables that have since been laid where the managers availed themselves of the knowledge and experience obtained by the atlantic cable have been perfectly successful all these triumphs over the sea are greatly indebted to the bold attempt to cross the atlantic made four years the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https ﬁrst atlantic cable therefore has accomplished great work in telegraphy branch of the art but little known before in one sense it was failure in another it was brilliant success despite every disadvantage it was laid across the ocean it was stretched from shore to shore and three weeks it continued to operate time long enough to settle forever the scientiﬁc question whether it was possible to communicate between two continents so far apart this was the work of the ﬁrst atlantic telegraph and if it lies silent at the bottom of the ocean till the destruction of the globe it has done enough the science of the world and the beneﬁt of mankind to entitle it to be held in honored and blessed memory now to the prospect of success in another attempt to lay telegraph across the ocean the most erroneous opinions prevail to the difﬁculties of laying submarine telegraphs in general and securing them against injury it is commonly supposed that the number of failures is much greater than of successes whereas the fact is that the later attempts where made with proper care have been almost uniformly successful in proof of this i will refer to the printed list of all the submarine ables manufactured and laid down by glass elliot of london from which it appears that within the space of eight years from 1854 to 1862 they have manufactured and laid down different cables among which are included three of the longest lines connecting england with the continent from england to holland 140 miles to hanover 280 miles and to denmark 368 miles the principal lines in the mediterranean from italy to corsica and thence to toulon from malta to sicily and from corfu to otranto and besides these the two chief of all that from france to algiers 520 miles laid in 1860 and the other laid only last year from malta to alexandria miles all together the lines laid by these manufacturers comprise total of miles and though some have been lying at the bottom of the sea and working eight years each one of them is at this hour in perfect condition on the day it was laid down with the exception of the two short lines laid in shallow water along the shore between liverpool and holyhead 25 miles and from prince edward island to new brunswick 11 miles the latter of which was broken by ship anchor and the former by the anchor of the royal charter during the gale in which she was wrecked both of which can be easily repaired where failures have occurred in submarine telegraphs the causes are now well understood and easily to be avoided thus with the ﬁrst atlantic cable its defects have all been carefully investigated by scientiﬁc men and may be easily guarded against when this cable was in process of manufacture in the factory of glass elliot in greenwich near london it was coiled in four large vats and there left exposed day after day to the heat of summer sun which was intensiﬁed by the tarred coating of the cable to one hundred and twenty degrees this went on day after day with the knowledge of the engineer and electrician of the company although the directors had given explicit orders that sheds should be erected over the vats to prevent the possibility of such an occurrence might have been foreseen the was melted so that the conductor which it was desired to insulate was so twisted by the coils that it was left quite bare in numberless places thus weakening and eventually when the cable was submer ged destroying the insulation the injury was partially discovered before the cable was taken out of the factory at greenwich and length of about thirty miles was cut out and condemned this however did not wholly remedy the difﬁculty the defective insulation became frequently and painfully apparent while the cable was being submer ged still further evidence of its imperfect condition was afforded when it came to be cut up charms and the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https ﬁrst cable was to great extent an experiment leap in the dark its material and construction were good the state of knowledge at that time provided and in many respects not unsuitable but the company could not avail itself at that time of the instruments or apparatus testing its conducting power and insulation in the manner since pointed out by experience the effects of temperature we have seen were not provided the vast differences in the conducting power of copper were discovered only by means of that cable when made the mathematical law whereby the proportions of insulation to conduction are determined had not been fully investigated and it was even argued by some of the pretended electricians in the employ of the company that the smaller the conductor the more rapidly the current could pass through it mode of protecting the external sheath from oxidation had then been discovered and the kind of machinery necessary submer ging cables in deep water could only be theoretically assumed looking back to that period and granting that there was too much haste in the preparations and that other mistakes were committed which could now be foreseen and avoided it is not too much to say that if that cable could be laid and worked was done after one failure in 1857 and the consequent uncoiling and storag of it in an exposed situation and after three attempts in 1858 under the most fearful circumstances to weather it would be an easy task to lay cable constructed and submer ged by the light of present experience illustration the cable laid in 1858 illustration the proposed new cable the above cuts representing sections of the cable laid in 1858 and the proposed new cable will serve to show the difference between the two and the immense superiority of the latter over the former in the old atlantic cable the copper weighed but pounds to the mile while in the new cable it weighs ﬁve hundred and ten pounds to the mile or more than ﬁve times much now the size or diameter of telegraphic conductor is just important an item in determining the strength of current which can be maintained upon it with given amount of the length of the conductor to produce the effects by which the messages are expressed at the end of telegraphic wire or cable it is necessary that the electric current should have certain intensity or strength now the intensity of the current transmitted by given voltaic battery along given line of wire will decrease other things being the same in the same proportion the length of the wire increases thus if the wire be continued ten miles the current will have twice the intensity which it would have if the wire had been extended to distance of twenty miles it is evident therefore that the wire may be continued to such length that the current will longer have sufﬁcient intensity to produce at the station to which the despatch is transmitted those effects by which the language of the despatch is signiﬁed but the intensity of the current transmitted by given voltaic battery upon wire of given length will be increased in the same proportion the area of the section of the wire is augmented thus if the diameter of the wire be doubled the area of its section being increased in fourfold proportion the intensity of the current transmitted along the wire will be increased in the same ratio the intensity of the current may also be augmented by increasing the number of pairs of the generating plates or cylinders composing the galvanic battery the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https electrical terms are arbitrary and necessarily unintelligible to the general reader i shall therefore use them sparingly possible and endeavor to make myself clearly understood by explaining those which i use all telegraphic conductors offer certai n resistance to the passage of an electric current and the amount of this resistance is proportional to the length of the conductor and inversely to its size in order to overcome this resistance it is necessary to increase the number of the cells in the battery and thus obtain ﬂuid of greater force or intensity on aërial this increase in the intensity of the battery occasions particular inconvenience other than by tending to the more rapid destruction of the small copper coils or helices employed but upon submarine lines it has the effect of increasing the static electricity or electricity of tension which accumu lates along the surface of the covering of the in the same manner static electricity accumulates on the surface of glass or of stick of by rubbing it with piece of cloth the use of submarine or of subterranean conductors occasions from the above cause small retardation in the velocity of the transmitted electricity this retardation is not due to the length of the path which the electric current has to traverse since it does not take place with conductor equally long insulated in the air but it arises from static reaction caused by the passage of an intense current through conductor well insulated but surrounded outside its insulating coating by conducting body such or moist ground or even by the metallic envelope of iron wires placed in communication with the ground when this conductor is presented to one of the poles of battery the other pole of which communicates with the ground it becomes charged with static electricity like the coating of which is capable of giving rise to dischar even after the voltaic current has ceased to be transmitted volta showed in one of his beautiful experiments that in putting one of the ends of his pile in communication with the earth and the other with the jar was charged in an instant of time to degree proportional to the force of the pile at the same time an instantaneous current was observed in the conductor between the pile and the jar which had all the properties of an ordinary current now it is evident that the subaqueous wire with its insulating covering may be assimilated exactly to an immense the glass of the jar represents the the internal coating is the surface of the copper wire the external coating is the surrounding metallic envelope and water to form an idea of the capacity of this new kind of battery we have only to remember that the surface of the wire is equal to fourteen square yards per mile bringing such wire into communication by one of its ends with battery of which the opposite pole is in contact with the earth whilst the other extremity of the wire is insulated must cause the wire to take charge of the same character and tension that of the pole of the battery touched by it these currents of static induction are proportional in intensity to the force of the battery and the length of the wire whilst an inverse relation is true regards the length of the conductor with the ordinary voltaic current professor wheatstone proved by actual experiment that continuous current may be maintained in the circuit of the long wire of an electric cable of which one of the ends is insulated whilst the other communicates with one of the poles of battery whose other pole the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https with the ground this current he considers due to the uniform and continual dispersion of the statical electricity with which the wire is char ged along its whole length it was mainly owing to the retardation from this cause that communication through the atlantic cable was so exceedingly slow and difﬁcult i will now endeavor to show why the new cable will not be liable to this difﬁculty to anything like the same extent i have alluded to the resistance offered by the conductor of to the passage of an electric current and to the retardation of this current by static induct ion the terms retardation and resistance are not considered technically synony mous but are intended electrical terms to designate two very different forces the resistance of wire we have seen above is proportional to its length and inversely to its diameter it is overcome by increasing the number of cells in the battery or in other words by increasing the intensity or force of the current the retardation in telegraphic cable on the contrary is proportional to the length of the and the intensity of the battery in the former case by increasing the electrical force you overc ome the resistance while in the latter by augmenting the electrical force you increase the retardation from the foregoing law it will be seen that there are two ways of lessening the resistance upon telegraphic conductors by reducing the length and the other by increasing the area of the section of the now already remarked the copper in the old cable weighed but pounds to the mile while in the new cable it weighs ﬁve hundred and ten pounds to the mile or more than ﬁve times much if then by comparison we estimate the resistance in the old atlantic cable to have been equal to two thousand miles of ordinary the increased size of the of the new cable reduces the resistance to that distance or four hundred miles and while it required two hundred cells of battery to produce intensity sufﬁcient to work over the two thousand miles of resistance in the old cable it will require but much or forty cells to overcome the four hundred miles of resistance in the new cable the retardation which resulted from the intense current genera ted by two hundred cells will be also proportionately reduced in the comparatively small battery of forty cells thus we perceive that while the length of the cable is electrically and practically reduced to of its former length the retardation of the current is also decreased in the same proportion therefore if with the old cable three words per minute could be transmitted with the new cable we shall be able to transmit ﬁve times many or ﬁfteen words per minute this is not equal to our morse system on the which will signal at the rate of words per minute still less to the printing system which can signal at the rate of ﬁfty words per minute but even at this rate the cable would be enabled to transmit in hours one thousand despatc hes containing an average of twenty words apiece field however claims the cable speed of only twelve words per minute which would reduce the number of despatches of twenty words each that could be transmitted in hours to eight hundred and sixty we will suppose however that the cable transmi ts only ﬁve hundred telegrams per day this number at ten dollars per message would give an income of ﬁve thousand dollars per diem or one million ﬁve hundred and thousand dollars per annum quite handsome revenue on an outlay of about one million of dollars the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https only instrument which could be used successfully in signalling through the old cable was one of peculiar construction called the marine galvanometer in this instrument momentum and inertia are almost wholly avoided by the use of needle weig hing only one and half grains combined with mirror reﬂecting ray of light which indicates deﬂections with great accuracy by this means gradually increasing or decreasing current is at each instant indicated at its due strength thus when this galvanometer is placed the instrument at the end of long submarine cable the movement of the spot of light consequent on the completion of circuit through the battery cable and earth can be so observed to furnish curve representing very accurately the arrival of an electric current lines representing successive signals at various speeds can also be obtained and by means of metronome dots and dashes can be sent with nearly perfect regularity by an ordinary morse key and the corresponding changes in the current at the receiving end of the cable accurately observed system of arbitrary characters similar to those used upon the morse telegraph was employed and the letter to be indicated was determined by the number of oscillations of the needle well by the length of time during which the needle remained in one place the operator who watched the reﬂection of the deﬂected needle in the mirror held key in his hand communicating with local instrument in the ofﬁce which he pressed down or raised according to the deﬂection of the needle and another operator deciphered the characters thus produced upon the paper this mode of telegraphing was of necessity very slow and it will not surprise the reader that the fastest rate of speed over the cable did not exceed three words per minute still had the old cable conti nued in operation few months longer experience and practice would have enabled the opera tor to transmit and receive with very much greater facility on our operators of long experience acquire dexterity which enables them not only to transmit and receive telegrams with wonderful rapidity but to work the instruments during storms when those of less experience would be unable to receive dot there is occupation in which skill and experie nce are more necessary to success than in that of telegraphing and at the time the atlantic cable was laid experience had been obtained upon similar lines or with the instruments employed now however the company can avail itself of experienced operators from lines of nearly equal length and who will requi re time experimenting but may commence operations soon the two ends of the cable are landed upon the shores of europe and america in the old cable the copper wire was covered but three times with while in the new it is covered four times with the purest and four times with chatterton patent

routes to europe have been proposed and have been at times quite popu lar the most feasible of which are those viâ behring straits or the aleutian islands and viâ labrador greenland iceland and the faroe isles to the route viâ behring straits there are several grave objections the distance from new york to london by route crossing the three continents of america asia and europe is about eighteen thousand miles or more than nine times great that from newfoundland to ireland of course the mere cost of constructing continuous telegraph of the distance around the globe and of maintaining the hundreds of stations that would be necessary over such length of would be enormous but even that is not the chief difﬁculty line which should traverse the whole breadth of siberia would encounter wellnigh insuperable obstacles in the country itself it would have to pass over mountains and across deserts while it turned north to kamtschatka it would come into region of frightful cold where winter reigns the greater part of the year of this whole country large part is not only utterly uncivilized but uninhabited and portions which are occupied are held by savage and warlike tribes of the greenland route doctor hayes the arctic traveller expresses himself in the most decided manner that it is wholly impracticable he says it must be obvious that the ice which hugs the greenland coast will prevent cable if laid from remaining in continuity any length of time doctor wallich naturalist attached to sir leopold mcclintock expedition to survey the northern route considers it impracticable on account of the volcanic nature of the bottom of the sea near iceland and the ridges of rock and the immense iceber gs near greenland the main argument in favor of this route in preference to the more direct one across the atlantic is that it would be impossible to work in one continuous circuit line so long that from newfoundland to ireland this would seem to be answered sufﬁciently by the success of the old atlantic cable but it is alleged that it worked slowly and with difﬁculty which is true and hence it is thought that the distance would be at least very great obstacle but we have shown that practically by the increased size of the the new cable has been reduced in length and will work ﬁve times fast the old one the cable extending from malta to alexandria is ﬁfteen hundred and miles long and the whole of this line can be worked through without relay or repetition in satisfactory manner regards both its scientiﬁc and commercial results and with remarkably low the company which made the core of this cable says that suitably made and insulated laid intact between ireland and newfoundland can be worked efﬁciently both in commercial and scientiﬁc sense and they are prepared to guaranty the efﬁcient and satisfactory working of line of the length of the atlantic cable manufactured by themselves and submer ged and maintained in that state it can be shown by the testimony and experience of those most eminent in the science and practice of oceanic telegraphy that neith er length of distance within the limits with which the atlantic company has to deal nor depth of water is any insuperable impediment to efﬁcient communication by such improved conductors of electricity are now proposed to be the project gutenberg ebook of the

willing to pledge their judgment that on such length of line that between ireland and new foundland and with such cable and such improved instruments are now at command not less than twelve words per minute could be transmitted from shore to shore and that this may be done with greatly diminished power compared with that formerly used i think i have shown by facts and not theory merely that the atlantic cable can and will be successfully laid down and worked thus supplying the link between the three hundred thousand miles of electric telegraph already in operation on the opposi shores of the atlantic there are many of our people who are inclined to look coldly upon this enterprise from conviction that it would give great britain an undue advantage over us in case war should occur between the two countries and i confess to having entertained the same views but the case is so well put by field in his address before the american geographical society in my judgment to relieve every apprehension upon this point the relative geographical position of the two countries can not be changed it so happens that the two points on the opposite sides of the atlantic nearest to each other and which are therefore the natural termini of an ocean telegraph are both in british territory of course the government which holds both ends can control the use of the telegraph or stop it altogether it has the power and the only check upon the abuse of that power must be by treaty made beforehand shall we refuse to aid in constructing the line fear that england in the exasperation of war would disregard any treaty stipulations in reference to its use then we throw away our only security suppose war to break out the ﬁrst step of england would be to lay cable herself her own sole and exclusive beneﬁt then she would not only have the control but would be unrestrained by any binding her to respect the neutrality of the telegraph we should then ﬁnd this great medium of communication between the two hemispheres which we might have made if not an ally at least neutral turned into powerful antagonist would it not therefore be better that such line of telegraph should be constructed by the joint efforts of both countries and be guarded by so that it might be placed far possible under the protection of the faith of nations and of the honor of the civilized world field says that in the negotiations on this subject great britain has never shown the slightest wish to take advantage of its geographical position to exact special privileges or desire to appropriate any advantages which it was not willing to concede equally to the united states should not the atlantic telegraph if laid down under the conditions proposed by the company instead of being cause of apprehension in case of war be rather looked upon with favor tending to lessen the risk of war between the united states and all european countries affording it would facili ties the prompt

of the present rebellion the personal history of its leaders and the incidents immediately preceding the breaking out of the conspiracy will ever remain objects of chief interest to the historian of the present period of the republic inﬂuenced by desire to obtain unimpeachable information upon these topics from unprejudiced sources the writer of the following article then student at yale college availed himself of the vacation in december 1860 and january 1861 to visit the national capital and while there to improve the reasonably ready access with which most public men are approached whenev er the object is either to give or to receive information the purpose of studying period then promising to exceed in importance anything in the past history of the nation it has been suggested to the writer that certain interviews such younger men when collegians were then allowed with the frank southern leaders and which he has occasionally sketched in conversation have had the seal of privacy removed by the tide of events and should now be described the public aiding to unmask from unquestionab le authority the real causes and origin of the rebellion and contributing something perhaps to sustain public sentiment in the defence of the nation against conspiracy which the statements of these southern apologists themselves prove to have been conceived in the most reckless disregard of honor and law and which if successful will give birth to neighboring nation actuated by the same spirit the more important interviews alluded to were with the honorable robert toombs the honorable hunter and the hono rable jefferson davis at that time prominent members is well known of the united states senate from the states respectively of georgia virginia and mississippi the communications of the senators are proved to have been sincere by their subsequent speeches and by public even ts the writer is by means insensible to the breach of privilege of which under ordinary circumstances

private conversations but he believes that the public will sustain the propriety of the present revelations now that the persons chieﬂy concerned have become enemies of the nation and of mankind not he may possibly be accused with the purpose of adding syllable of unnecessary length to the narrative but the sake of vividness in presenting the idea of the personnel of the southern leaders soon to be known only historical characters and of scrupulous accuracy in representing their sentiments to which in this case notice of time place and manner seems necessary that of matter the writer has taken not little pains through all the usual means to remember and will endeavor to state the conversation s always with logical and nearly always he believes with verbal accuracy in order that the conclusions to be drawn from them by the reader may have the better support it is well known that public men in washington out of business hours are visited without formal introduction or letters especially upon their and that the privilege of single interview implies distinction to the visitor the urbanity and frankness with which proper approaches are met especially by the southern leaders are also well known young men with unprejudiced minds upon whom public characters are always anxious to impress the stamp of their own principles are perhaps received with quite much frankness others the ﬁrst interview sought was with toombs the most daring and ingenuous and perhaps the most gifted in eloquence of the southern leaders whose house at that time was lofty building upon f street only two doors from the residence of seward negro servant who with all the blackness of native african yet with thin lips and almost the regular features of caucasian appeared to the writer to be possibly

public career his and inquiry concerning the college named on the card of the writer were in tone that at once placed his visitor at ease your ﬁrst visit to washington mr yes sir like others i have been attracted by the political crisis and the purpose of studying it from unprejudiced sources crisis oh that past the writer will not soon forget the tone of perfect conﬁdence and nonchalance with which this was uttered the time was the last week of december the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https you are conﬁdent then sir that ﬁfteen states will secede secede certainly must secede you northerners are from northern college i believe to the writer card you northerners wish to make new constitution or rather to give such an interpretation to the old one to make it virtually new document how can society be kept together if men will not keep their compacts our fathers provided in adopting their constitution the protection of their property but here are four billions of the property of the south which you propose to outlaw from the common territories you say to us by your elected president by your house of representatives by your senate by your supreme court in short by every means through which one party can speak to another that these four billions of property representing the toil of the head and hand of the south the last two hundred years shall not be respected in the territories your property is respected there and this property too is property which you tax and which you allow to be represented but yet you will not protect it how can we remain we should be happy to remain if you would treat us equals but you tax us and will not protect us we will resist it and other striking expressions are precisely toombs language we will meet you on the border with the bayonet society can not be kept together unless men will keep their compacts this was said without the intonation of ﬁerceness or malignity but with great decision and the vigor of high spirit it was taking of course with considerable emphasis side in famous constitutional question familiar to all readers of american congressional debates once supported by calhoun and rather strangely too with that philosophical leader confusing the absurdly asserted state right of seceding at will with the undoubted right when there exists peaceful remedy of seceding from intolerable oppression an entire position which webster especially and subsequent statesmen in arguments elucidating the nature and powers of the general government to say nothing of the respect due to moral sentiment concerning slavery which permeating more than majority of the people has the force when properly expressed wherever the constitution has jurisdiction of supreme law are thought by most men once and forever to have satisfactorily answered it was complaint certainly which the south had had ever since the constitution was formed and which could with plausibility be brought forward justiﬁcation of war while there existed constitutional tribunal adjusting difﬁculties of constitutional interpretation yet it was almost universally asserted of course by the northern partisan presses and by northern congressmen that the rebellion was utterly causeless and the writer was therefore exceedingly anxious to obtain concerning their grievances the latest opinions of the southern leaders stated by themselves he ventured to propose in pause of toombs somewhat rapid rhetoric question which at that moment seemed of central importance to the candid philosophical inquirer into the moving forces of the times are we then sir to consider calhoun old of property under the federal constituting now the chief grievance of the south undoubtedly was mr toombs instant reply it all turns on that what you tax you must pr otect the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https is the very strongest argument of the southern side but the alleged is protected though only under municipal law by the constitution to protect it elsewhere is against its whole spirit and in the present state of public sentiment against its very letter originally is well known it was not proposed to protect at all under the general government property so monstrous except it became necessary compromise in order to secure union but the provision of the constitution that the should be abolished the absolute power given to congress to make all laws the territories the spirit of the preamble the principles of the declaration indeed the whole history of the origin and adoption of the fundamental law prove that its principle and its expectatio n were if not absolutely to place slavery in the states in process of extinction at least never to recognize it except indirectly and remotely under municipal law not even by admitting the word slave to its phraseology even in the northern states themselves to say nothing of the territories i am not safe with my property i can travel through france or england and be safe but if i happen to lose my servant up in vairmount toombs pronounced the word with somewhat marked accent of derision and undertake to recover him i get jugged besides your northern statesmen are far from being honest here is billy seward instance gesture toward his neighbor house who says slavery is contrary to the higher law and that he is bound christian to obey the higher law but yet he takes an oath to uphold the constitution which protects slavery this inconsistency runs through most of the northern platform how can we live with such men they will not be true even to compact which they themselves acknowledge you would think then wendell phillips instance more consistent in his political opinions than mr seward certainly i can understand his positi on he says wrong the constitution protects slavery therefore i will have nothing to with the constitution and can not become citizen this is logical and consistent i can respect such position that here perhaps the writer ought not to relate competent

all odds we have better opportunity understanding you than you have understanding us the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and

or blood riots at the north the writer was surprised to ﬁnd notwithstanding toombs eulogy of southern opportunities his understanding of the north so imperfect and still more surprised at the political and social principles involved in the spirit of what followed your poor population can hold and can vote but we know better how to take care of ours they are in the ﬁelds and under the eye of their overseers there can be little danger of an insurrection under our system the subject and the manner of the man in spite of his better qualities were becoming painful and the writer ventured only one more remark an ugly time certainly if war comes between north and south ugly time oh the writer will never forget the tone of utter carelessness and nonchalance with which the last exclamation was uttered oh war is nothing never more than tenth part of the adult population of country in the ﬁeld we have four million voters say tenth of them or four hundred thousand men are in the ﬁeld on both sides tenth of them would be killed or die of camp diseases but they would die any way war is nothing the tone perfectly proved this belief not badinage some property would be destroyed towns injured fences overturned and the devil raised generally but then all that would have good effect only yaller men and editors make noise about war wars are to history what storms are to the atmosphere puriﬁers we shall meet we ought whoever invades our rights with the bayonet we are the gentlemen of this land and gentlemen always make revolutions in history this was said in the tone of an injured but haughty man with perfect intellectual poise and earnestness yet with fervor of feeling that brought the speaker erect in his chair the signiﬁcance of the last remarks which the writer can make oath he has preserved verbatim being somewhat calculated to draw on debate of course wholly unﬁtted to the time and place the writer apologizing having taken so much time at formal interview and receiving of course most courteous invitation to renew the call found himself after but twenty minutes conversation on the street in the lonely december evening with mind full of reﬂections the utter recklessness concerning life and property with which the splendid intellect under the lead of the ungovernable passions of this man was plunging the nation into civil war of which one could foresee the end was the thought uppermost certainly the the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https of asserting rights supposed to be infringed it was in itself impossible not to respect but the man seemed to love war its own sake pugnacious schoolboys love with sort of glee in the smell of the smoke of battle the judicial calmness of statesmanship had entirely disappeared in the violence of sectional passion perhaps he might be capable of ruining his country from pure love of turbulence and power could he but ﬁnd pretext of force sufﬁcient to blind ﬁrst himself and then others yet robert toombs in the senate chamber takes little children in his arms and is one of the kindest of the noblemen of nature in the sphere of his unpolitical sympathies the reader who is familiar with toombs speeches will need assurance that he spoke frankly footnote ten days later in the senate with face full of the combined erubescence of revolutionary enthusiasm and unstatesmanlike anger toombs closed speech to the northern senators in the following amazing words congr essional globe 271 which justify it will

the writer found his way to his hotel at this time the north was silent apparently apathetic unbelieving almost criminally allowed to be undeceived by its presses and by public men who had means of information while this volcano continued to prepare itself thus deﬁantly beneath the very feet of president sworn to support the laws the formal interview with the honorable hunter was sought in compa ny with two other students of colleges we had hoped to meet maso n at the same apartments but were disappointed the great contrast of personal character between hunter and toombs made the concurrence of the former in the chief views presented by the latter the more signiﬁcant the careful habits of thought the unostentatiousness and the practical common sense which the virginian farmer is esteemed and which had made his name prominent one president of central confederacy in case of the separate secession of the border states were curiously manifested both in his apartments and his manner the chamber was apparently at ouse but very plainly furnished with red cotton serge curtains and common chairs and sofa the senator manner of speech was slow considerate sometimes approaching awkwardness in its plain farmer simplicity one of the ﬁrst questions was the central one concerning the chief grievance of the south which had been presented to mr toombs yes was hunter reply somew hat less promptly given it may be said to come chieﬂy from that of our property under the constitution we wish our property recognized we think the constitution provides we should like to remain with the north he spoke without particle of expressed passion or ardor though by means incapable when aroused those who have seen his plethoric countenance and ﬁgure can testify of both we are mutually helpful to each other we want to use your navy and your factories you want our cotton the north to manufactur and the south to produce would make the strongest nation but if we separate we shall try to more in

manufacturing in virginia the chesapeake bay and our rivers should aid commerce the slaves i think there is little danger of any trouble there may be some he said with frankness that surprised us slightly but in the same moderate honest way his hands clasped upon his breast and the extended feet rubbing together slowly in the cotton states where they are very thick together but i think that there is very little danger in virginia the way they take to rise in never shows much skill the last time they rose in our state i think the attempt was brought on by some sign in an eclipse of the moon the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https all that passed of political interest is contained in the foregoing sentences except one honest reply to question concerning his opinion of the probability of the north attempting coercion if only three states go out they may coerce said hunter but if ﬁfteen go i guess they wo try at the present period of the rebellion this indication of the anticipations of its leaders in engaging in it must be of interest it must be understood that the writer and his companions presented themselv es simply students with ﬁxed exclusive predilections either of the public partie s in politics which in the writer case at least was certainly statement wholly true that this evident freedom from political bias secured perhaps an unusual share of the conﬁdence of the southern senators it will be remembered also that in every conversation howeve r startling the revelation of criminal purpose or absurd motive the manner of these senato rs was always totally devoid of any approach to that vulgar intellectual levity which too often in treating of public affairs painfully characterizes the men whom the north someti mes chooses to make its representatives the manner of the southern leaders was to us sufﬁcient proof of their sincerity at the house of the honorable jefferson davis now in the world gaze president of the then nascent confederacy the writer in the intelligent and genial company of the graduate of harvard and the student of amherst before mentioned called formally on the evening of the new year representative from one of the southwestern state s was present but we were soon admitted to the front of the open blazing grate of the we had before seen mr davis busy in the senate the urbanity the intellectual energy and the intensely shrewd watchfulness and ambition combined with covertly expressed but powerful native instinct strategy and command which have made davis public leader were evident at the ﬁrst glance the senator seemed compact of ambition will intellect activity and shrewdness high and broad but square forehead the aquiline nose the square ﬁghting chin the thin compressed but ﬂexible lips the almost haggardly sunken cheek the piercing not wholly uncovered eye the dark somewhat thinning hair the clear slightly browned nervous complexion all well given in the best current photographs were united to ﬁgure slightly bent in the shoulders of more respiratory than digestive breadth in outlines almost equally balancing ruggedness and grace of compactness wrought by the pressure of perhaps few more than ﬁfty summers not above medium height but composed throughout of silk and steel certain similarity between the decorations of the parlor and the character of the owner perhaps more fanciful than real at once attracted attention everything was simple graceful and rich without being tropically luxuriant the paintings appeared to be often of airy winged or ﬁgures that suggested reﬂective and not unimaginative mind in the one who had chosen them this was the leader whom calhoun fervent political metaphysics and his own ambition place and power had misled his conversation was remarkable in manne r perfect unostentatiousness clearness and and in matter breadth and minuteness the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https information in the whole conversation he never uttered broken or awkwardly constructed sentence nor wavered while stating facts by single intonation this considerable intellectual energy combined with courtesy was his chief fascination yet underneath all lay an atmosphere of covert haughtiness and at times even of audacious remorselessness which under stimulative circumstances were to be feared undoubtedly passion and ambition were natively stronger in the countenance than reason conscience and general sympathy observation best felt to be true when the face was compared in imagination with the faces of some of the world chief benefactors but culture native urbanity and powerful reﬂective tendency had evidently so wrought that though conscience might be imperilled frequently by great adroitness in the casuistry of justice could not be consciously opposed any length of time without powerful silent reaction the quantity of being however though superior was not of so high measure the quality and the principal deﬁciencies though perhaps almost the sole ones were plainly moral in his presence man could deny to him something of that dignity of kind superior to that of intellect and will which must be possessed by every leader basis of conﬁdence but mournful severe truth would testify that there was yet at times palpably something of the treacherous serpent in the eye and it could not readily be told where it would strike in reply to reference to somewhat celebrated speech by senator benjamin of louisiana which we had heard the day previous he said that we might consider it whole very fair statement both of the arguments and the purposes of the south perhaps speech of more horrible doctrine upheld by equal argumentative and rhetorical power has neve r been heard in the american senate in reply also to the one central question concerning the chief grievance of the south he gave in substance the same answer uttered perhaps with more logical calmness that had been given by hunter and toombs that it was substa ntially covered by calhoun old complaint the of under the federal constitution of course we were yet too well established in the belief that slavery in the united states is upheld by the constitution only very remotely and indirectly under local or municipal law to desire even by questions to draw on any debate in reply to question by the gentleman from harvard he spoke of central confederacy altogether improbable and thought if geor gia seceded the telegrams the last fortnight had indicated she would maryland would be sure to go i think the commerci al and political interests of maryland he remarked in his calm and simple but distinct and watchful manner manifesting too at the same time natural command of digniﬁed antithet ical sentences would be promoted perhaps can be only preserved by secession her territory extends on both sides of great inland water communication and is at the natural atlantic outlet by railway of the valley of the west baltim ore in the union is sure to be inferior to philadelphia and new york baltimore out of the union is sure to become great commercial city in every way whether we regard her own people or their usefulness to other states i think the interests of maryland would be promoted by secession but would not maryland lose many more slaves the border member of foreign confederacy than she does now in the union the reply to this question we looked with the greatest interest since foreign nation such the north would be in case of the success of the attempted confederacy ever thinks the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https up fugitives and since the policy of the south upon this point in case she should succeed would determine the possibility or impossibility of peace between the two portions of the continent davis reply was in the following words uttered in tone of equal shrewdness calmness and decision i think all maryland would lose in that way she would be more than repaid by reprisals while we are one nation and you steal our property we have little redress but when we become two nations we shall say two can play at this game we breathed more freely after so frank an utterance the great importance of this reply coming from the even then proposed political chief of the confederacy indicating the impossibility of peace even in case of the recognition of the south so long it should continue it has begun to make slavery the chief corner of the state will be at once perceived but the writer ventured to inquire what will become of the federal district since its inhabitants have right of secession have you ever studied law he asked the gentleman from amherst confessed our ignorance of any point covering the case there is rule in law continued davis that when property is granted by one party to another use any speciﬁed purpose and ceases to be used that purpose it reverts by law to the donor now the territory constituting at present the district of columbia was granted you well know by maryland to the united states use the seat of the federal capital when it ceases to be used that purpose it with all its public ﬁxtures will revert by law to maryland but and his eye brightened to the hue of cold steel in way the writer will never forget he uttered in tone perfectly undaunted and slightly deﬁant the words that is point which may be settled by ce rather than by r eason this was january 1 1861 only eleven days after south carolina had passed her act of secession and shows that even then notwithstanding the professed desire of the south to depart in peace the attack not only upon the national principles of union but upon the national property well was projected davis loaded with the beneﬁts of his country yet occupied seat in the senate chamber under the most solemn oath to uphold its constitution which even if his grievances had been well founded afforded constitutional and peaceful remedies that he had never attempted to use presenting regards very formal indeed sick at heart indignant and anxious we left the house of the traitor the historical conclusions to be drawn from the above slight sketches are important in several respects davis toombs and hunter are among the strongest leaders of the rebellion representing the northern southeastern and southwestern populations of the disaf fected regions their testimony had wide application and was perhaps characteristic and pointed in these brief conversation s occurring just upon the eve of the bursting of the storm we should have heard in hundred interviews that they spoke frankly was not the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https to us by their entire manner but it is not unimportant to repeat has been proved by subsequent events the conversations therefore indicate that the grand fundamental legal ground the rebellion was view of constitutional rights by which property in human beings claimed equal protection under the general government with the products of free labor and to be admitted therefore at will to all places under the jurisdiction of the federal power and not simply to be protected under local or municipal law which the south proposed to vindicate constitutionally by secession or in other words by the domination of state over national sovereignty an entire view of the true intent of the federal compacts and powers which in the great debates between webster and calhoun to say nothing of elucidations by previous and subsequent jurists and statesmen has been again and again abundantly demo nstrated to be absurd that the immediate comprehensive pretext the rebellion was the success of legal majority having in its platform of principles the doctrine of the of involuntary human bondage in the territories over which the constitution had given to the whole people absolute control doctrine which the mass of the southern populations were educated to believe not only deadly to their local privileges but distinctly unconstitutional that the leaders of the rebellion frankly admitted that excepting this one point of constitutional grievance the interests of the populations which they represented would be better subserved in the union than out of it that the leaders of the rebellion appear not to have anticipated coercion but yet from the earliest days of secession contemplated the spoliation of the southern national property and particularly the seizure of the federal capital that even should the independence of the south be acknowledged peace could not result so long slavery should continue their avowed system of reprisals the certain escape of slaves precluding all force in any but piratical international law that the spirit of the rebellion is the haughty grasping and except within its own circle the remorseless spirit universally characteristic of oligarchies before the success of whose principles upon this continent the liberties of the whites could be safer than those of the blacks we are the gentlemen of this land said the geor gian senator and gentlemen always make revolutions in history and just previously he had said with haughty signiﬁcan ce your poor population can hold and can vote but we know better how to take care of ours they are in the ﬁelds and under the eye of their overseers in these two brief remarks taken singly or especially in juxtapositio n from so representative source and so charac teristic of oligarchical opinions everywhere appears condensed the suggestive political warning of these times indeed of all times and which people regardful of civil and religious liberty can never be slow to heed let the pride of race and the aristocratic tendencies which underlie the resistance of the south prevail and we shall see new america the land of the fathers and of the present the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly

our fault that we were bound to uphold the worst system of slavery that ever was known among men we must judge of every wrong that is perpetrated by the circumstances that are connected with it and our oppression of the african race was peculiarly offensiv inasmuch it was proceeding in ﬂagrant violation of our constantly avowed principles was continued in face of the opinions of the founders of the nation was frankly upheld on the unmanly ground that the intellectual weakness of the slaves rendered it safe to oppress them and was not excused by that general ignorance of right which has so often been brought forward in palliation of wrong slavery had come under the ban of christendom years before americans could be found boldly bad enough to claim it divine origin and to avow that it was proper and even the best foundation civil society our offence was of the rankest and its peculiar character rendered us odious in the eyes of the nations who would not admit the force of our plea to the great difﬁculties that lay in the way of the removal of the evil they had seen it condemned by most communities and abolished by some of their number the very circumstance upon which americans have relied the justiﬁcation of their form of slavery namely that it was conﬁned to one race and that race widely separated from all other races by the existence of peculiar characteristics has been

they therefore were justiﬁed in treating all other men inferiors and making the same use of them they made of horses the roman system which was based on the will of society and therefore made exceptions on the score of color but saw in all strangers only creatures of chase the mussulman system brought out so strongly by the action of the states of barbary and which was colored by the character of the long quarrel between mahometans and christians and under which northern africa was ﬁlled with myriads of slaves from southern europe among whom were men of the highest intellect

one race that should forever dwell in the house of bondage if in some respects our system has been more humane than that of other peoples in other times the fact is owing to that general improvement which has taken place the earth over during the present century the world has gone forward and even american slaveholders have been compelle d to go with it whether they would or not it was distinctive feature of slavery here known that it tended to debauch the mind of christendom so long all men were liable to be enslaved and even shakspeare and milton were in some danger of sharing the fate of cervantes the barbary corsairs did actually carry off men from the british islands in the times of milton and shakspeare could not fail to grow up general hostility to slavery and the institution was booked destruction but when slavery came to be considered the appropriate condition of one race and the members of that race so highly qualiﬁed to engage in the production of cotton and sugar tobacco and rice the danger was not only that slavery would once more come into favor but that the african would be replaced in the list of legitimate commercial pursuits and become more extensive than it was in those days when it was defended by bishops and kings sons in the british house of lords that this is not an unfounded opinion will be admitted by those who recollect that the london times that representative of the average english the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https recently published articles that could mean nothing less than desire to revive the old system of slavery with all that should be necessary to maintain it in force that carlyle is an advocate of the oppression of negroes and that the french government at one time seemed disposed to have resort to course that must if adopted have converted africa into storehouse of slaves our slaveholders were not blind to this altered state of the european mind of which they availed themselves and of which in certain sense they had the best of all rights to avail themselves it was largely their own work at the same time that england abolished slavery in her dominions the chief nulliﬁers who were the fathers of the secession rebellion assumed the position that negro slavery was good in itself and that it was the duty of white men to uphold and to extend it this was done by governor mcdufﬁe of south carolina in 1834 and it was warmly approved by many southern men well out of south carolina in that most fanatical of states but generally condemned by the democrats of that time though now it is not uncommon to ﬁnd men in the north who accept all that the old nulliﬁer put forward new truth years ago earnestly and zealously and with small amount of talent the friends of slavery labored to impose their views upon the entire southern mind that not so much because they loved slavery itself because they knew that if the slaveholding interest could be placed in opposition to the federal union that union might be destroyed they were fanatics in their attachment to slavery but even their fanaticism was secondary to their hatred of that power which represented by andrew jackson had trampled down nulliﬁcation and compelled carolina and calhoun to retreat from cannon and the gallows rhett then barnwell smith said in the debates in the convention on the proposition to accept the tariff compro mise of 1833 that he hated the banner and unquestionably he expressed the feelings of many of his contemporaries who deemed submission prudent but who were consoled by the reﬂection that slavery would afford them far better means breaking up the union than it was possible to get through the existence of any tariff matter how protective it might be all the great leaders of the ﬁrst secession school had passed away from the earth when rhett still lived to see the ﬂag he hated pulled down before the ﬁre that was poured upon fort sumter from carolina batteries worked by the hands of carolinians calhoun hamilton mcdufﬁe hayne trumbull cooper harper preston and others men of the ﬁrst intellectual rank in america had departed but rhett survived to see what they had labored to effect and what they would have effected had they not encountered one of those iron spirits to whom is sometimes intrusted the government of nations and who are of more value to nations than gold and ﬂeets and armies all that we have lately seen done and more would have been done thirty years since had any other man than andrew jackson been at that time president of the united states there was much cant in those days about the power because president jackson saw ﬁt to make use of the constitutional qualiﬁed to express his opposition to certain measures adopted by congress but the best exhibition of the power that the country ever saw then or before or since was when the same magistrate crushed nulliﬁcation maintai ned the union and secured the nation peace more than quarter of century we neve r knew what great man jackson was until the country was cursed by buchanan occupation of the same chair that jackson had ﬁlled chair that he was unworthy to dust by his cowardice and treachery which made civil war inevitable one man at the close of 1860 could have done more than has yet been accomplished by the million of men who have been called to the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https such man was then in the nation service the one hour of dundee was not more wanting to the stuarts than the one month of jackson was wanting to us but two years ago the powerful teaching of the nulliﬁers was successful the south which assumed to be the exclusive seat of american nationality while the north was declared given up to sectionalism with other lights on its path than blue lights became the south so devoted to slavery that it could see nothing else in the country old union men of 1832 became secess ionists though nulliﬁcation the milder thing of the two had been too much them to endure they not only endured the more hideous evil but they embraced it between 1832 and 1860 change had been wrought such twice that time could not have accomplished at any earlier period of human history the old southern ideas respecting slavery had disappeared and that institution had become an object of idolatry so that any criticisms to which it was subjected kindled the same sort of ﬂame that is excited in pious community when objects of devotion are assailed and destroyed by the hands of unbelievers the astonishing material prosperity that accompanied the system of had doubt much to with the regard that was bestowed upon the system itself that was the time when cotton became king least in the opinion of its worshippers the democratic party of the north passed from that position of radicalism to which the name of locofocoism was given to the position of supporter s of the extremest southern doctrines so that some years it appeared to exist other purpose than to in the free states the cost of its maintenance being supplied by the federal revenues abroad the same chan ge began to be noted the demand cotton prevailing over the power of conscience everything worked well evil it could work and if satan himself had condescended to accept the post of the disturbers of america peace to take advantage of the change that had been brought about was the purpose of the whole political population of the south but though that section was united in its determination to support the supremacy of slavery it was far from being united in its opinions to the best mode of accomplishing its object there were three parties in the south in the last days of the old union the ﬁrst and the largest of these parties answered very nearly to the southern portion of the democratic party and contained whatever of sense and force belonged to the south it was made up of men who were ﬁrmly resolved upon one thing namely that they would ruin the union if they should forever lose the power to rule it but they had the sagacity to see that the ends which they had in view could be more easily achieved in the union than out of it they were not disunionists per but were quite ready to become disunio nists if the union was to be governed otherwise than in the direct and immediate interest of slavery slavery was the basis of their political system and they knew that it could be better served by the american union continued existence than by the construction of souther n confederacy provided the former should all that slaveholders might require it to the second southern party and the smallest of them all was composed of the minions of the nulliﬁers and of their immediate followers men whose especial object it was to destroy the union and who hated the subservient portion of the northern people far more bitterly than they hated republicans or even abolitionists they would have preferred abolition and disunion to the triumph of slavery and the preservation of the union it was not that they loved slavery less but that they hated the union more even if the country should submit to the south the leaders of this faction knew that they would not be the southrons to whom the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https intrusted the powers and the business of government few of them were of much account even in their own states and generally they could have been set down chiefs of the opposition to everything that was reasonable remarkable proof of the little hold which this class of men had on even the most mad of the southern states when at the height of their fury was afforded by the refusal of south carolina to elect rhett governor her legislature conferring that post on pickens moderate man when compared with rhett and who there is reason believing would have prevented resort to secession altogether could he have done so without sacriﬁcing what he held to be his honor the third southern party consisted of men who desired the continuance of the union but who wished that some concessions should be made or compromises effected in order to satisfy men one portion of whom were resolved upon having everything while the other portion were resolute in their purpose to destroy everything that then existed of national character this third party was mostly composed of those timid men whose votes count much at ordinary periods but who in extraordinary times are worse than worthless being in fact incumbrances on bolder men they loved the union because they loved peace and were opposed to violence of all kinds but their unionism was much like bailie macwheeble conscience which was described never doing him any harm what they would have done had government been able to send strong force to their assistance at the beginning of the war we can not undertake to say but they have done little to aid the federal cause in the ﬁeld while their inﬂuence in the federal councils has been more prejudicial to the country than the open exertions of the secessionists to ef fect the nation destruction of these parties the ﬁrst had every reason to believe that it could soon regain possession of congress and that in 1864 it would be able to elect its candidate to the presidency hence it had wish to dissolve the union and if its leaders could have had their way the union would have been spared but the second party making up its deﬁciency in numbers by the intensity of its zeal and laboring untiringly was too much the moderates hate is stronger feeling than love of any kind stronger even than love of spoils and the men who followed rhett and yancey pryor and spratt hated the union with perfect hatred they got ahead of the men who followed davis and stephens and the rest of those southern chiefs who would have been content with the complete triumph of southern principles in the republic it stood in they broke up the democratic party in order to render the election of the republican candidate certain so that they might found on his election the cri guerr of sectional triumph over the south so they coerced the southern people into the adoption of we have more than once heard lincoln blamed precipitating matters in april he should have temporize d it has been said and so have preserved peace but when he called thousand volunteers he made war unavoidable the truth is that lincoln did not begin the war it was begun by the south his call volunteers was the consequence of war being made on the nation and not the cause of war being made either on the south or by the south the enemy ﬁred upon and took fort sumter before the ﬁrst call volunteers was issued and that proceeding must be admitted to have been an act of war unless we are prepared to admit that there is right of secession and fort sumter was ﬁred upon and taken through the inﬂuence of the violent party at the south who were resolved that there should be war they knew that it was beyond the power of the federal government to send supplies to the doomed fort and that in few days it would pass into the hands of the confederates and this they determined to prevent because they knew also that the the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https of the garrison when it had eaten its last rations would not sufﬁce to ﬁre the northern heart they carried their point and hence it was that war was begun the middle of april but the triumph of the violent southern party the contest might have been postponed and even peace patched up the time and the inevitable struggle put off to future day it was government had choice and was compelled to ﬁght and it would have been compelled to ﬁght had it been composed entirely of quakers war being unavoidable and it being clear that slavery was the cause of it well its occasion and that it would be the main support of our enemy it ought to have followed that our ﬁrst blow should be directed against that institution nothing of the kind happened whatever government may have thought on the subject it did nothing to injure slavery but this forbearance which now appears so astonishing we are not disposed to blame the president he acted the representative of the country which was not then prepared to act vigorously against the root of the evil that afﬂicted it moral blindness prevailed which proved most injurious to the union cause and from the effect of which it may never recover it was supposed that it was yet possible to conciliate the south and that that section could be induced to come back into the union provided nothing should be done to hurt its feelings or injure its interests looking back to the summer of 1861 it is with difﬁculty that we can believe that men were then in possession of their senses so inconsistent was their conduct the rebels were at least sensitive on the subject of their military character they were on that of slavery and yet while we could not be sufﬁciently servile on the latter subject we acted most offensively on the former we asserted in every form and variety of language our ability to put them down and but the circumstance that not the slightest atom of ability marked the management of our military affairs we should have made our boasting good men who could not say enough to satisfy themselves on the point of the right of the chivalrous southrons to create breed work and sell slaves were equally in their expressed purpose to put down the said southrons because they had rebelled and rebelled only because they were slaveholders and the purpose of placing slavery beyond the reach of wordy assault in the country of which it should be the governing power there has been much complaint that foreigners have not understood the nature of our quarrel and that the general european hostility to the american national cause is owing to their ignorance of american affairs how that may be we shall not stop to inquire but it is beyond dispute that european community has ever displayed more glaring ignorance of the character of the contest here waged than was exhibited by most americans in the early months of that contest and down to recent period the war was treated by nearly the whole people if slavery had possible connection with it and if all mention of slavery in matters pertaining to the war were necessarily an impertinence foreign subject lugged into domestic discussion of the people were disposed querulously to ask why abolitionists could let slavery alone in it was bad thing was abolitionism in time of peace but its badness was vastly increased when we had war upon our hands half the other fourth of the citizens were disposed to agree with the majority but very shame kept them silent it was only the few who had proper conception of the state of things and they had little inﬂuence with the people and consequently none with government had they said much or attempted to anything probably they would have found federal arms directed against themselves with much more of force and effectiveness in their use than were manifested when they were directed against the rebels when union general could announce that he would make use of the northern soldiers under his command to destroy slaves who should be so audacious to rebel the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https and the announcement was received with rapturous approval at the north it was enough to convince every intelligent and reﬂecting man that just idea of the struggle we were engaged in was common and that blind people were following blind leaders into the ditch into that last ditch to which the secessionists have so often been doomed but in which they so obstinately continue to refuse to ﬁnd their own and their cause grave that government was not much ahead of the people in 1861 and through most of the present year respecting the position of slavery is very evident to all who know what it did and what it refused to with regard to that institution with hardiness that would have been strongly offensive if it had not been singularly ridiculous seward told the astonished world of europe that the fate of slavery did not depend upon the event of our contest was much to say that we should not injure it happen what might and one then supposed that the confederates would willingly strike blow at it either to conciliate foreign nations or to obtain black soldiers the words of the secretary of state did us harm in england with the religious portion of whose people it is something like an article of faith that slavery is an addition to the list of deadly sins they injured us too with the members of the various schools of liberal politicians over all europe and they furnished to our enemies abroad the argument that there really was difference between the north and the south on the slavery question and that therefore the sympathies of all generous minds should be with the southrons who were the weaker party our cause was irreparably damaged in europe through the indiscretion of the honorable secret ary who can not be accused of any love slavery but who was then he appears to be up to the present hour ignorant of the nature and the extent of the contest of which his country is the scene other members of the adm inistration had sounder ideas but their weight in it was not equal to that of the secretary of state it is but fair to the president to say that his conduct was such that it was obvious that he did not favor slavery because he had any respect it he pulled so hard upon the chains that bound him that his desire to throw them off was clear to the world but they were too strong and too well fastened to be got rid of easily he feared that all the unionists of the border states would be lost if he should adopt the views of the emancipationists and the fear was natural though in point of fact his course had good effect in those states beyond that of conciliating portion of the kentucki ans north carolina under the old system the most moderate of the slave states was far gone in secession south carolina and furnished far more men to the southern armies than her neighbor the virginians and missourians who went with us would have pursued the same course had the president opinions on slavery been radical and pronounced those of garrison maryland was kept from wheeling into the secession line only by the presence on her soil and in her vicinity of strong federal armies in tennessee at later period of the war in north carolina federal power extended far federal guns could throw federal shot though tennessee had not been renowned her extreme attachment to slavery but the heavy weight on the presidential mind came from the free states in which the party was so powerful and the nature of the war was so little understood that it was impossibl government to strike an effective blow at the source of the enemy strength before that could be done it would be necessary that the northern mind should be trained to justice in the school of adversity the position of the president in 1861 was not unlike to that which the prince of orange held in had william made his attempt on england in 1687 the end would have been failure complete that of monmouth in it was necessary that the english mind should be educated up to the the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https throwing aside some cherished doctrines the maintenance of which stood in the way of england safety prosperity and greatness william allowed the fruit he sought to ripen and in 1688 he was able to with ease that which human power could have done in so was it with lincoln and here had the proclamation lately put forth been issued in 1861 either it would have fallen dead or it would have met with such opposition in the north would have rendered it impossible to prosecute the war with any hope of success there would probably have been pronunciamientos from some of our armies and the union might have been shivered to pieces without the enemy lifting their hands further against it we not say that such would have been the course of events had the proclamation then appeared but it might have taken that turn and the president had to allow possibilities that perhaps it never occurred to private individuals to think of who had sense of responsibility either to the country to the national cause or to the tribunal of history he would not move he was advised to move by good men who had not taken into consideration all the circumstances of the case and who could not feel he was forced to feel because he was president of the united states probably if he had been private citizen he would have been the foremost man of the emancipation party but the place he holds is so high that he must look over the whole land and necessarily he sees much that others can never behold he saw that one of two things would happen in few months after the beginning of active warfare toward the close of last winter either the rebels would be beaten in the ﬁeld in which event there would be reasonable hope of the union reconstruction and the people could then take charge of slavery and settle its future condition to them should seem best our armies would be beaten and the people would be made to understand that slavery could longer be allowed to exist the support of an enemy who had announced from the beginning of their movement that their choice was ﬁxed upon conquest or failing that annihilation it was written that we should fail in the ﬁeld we sought to take richmond with an army of force that appeared to be adequate to the work we were beaten and after some months of severe warfare the country had the supreme felicity of celebrating the th anniversary of its independence by thanking heaven that its principal army had escaped capture by falling back to the fever banks of river on which lay naval force so strong to prevent the further advance of the victorious southrons the exertions that were made to remove that army from place that threatened its total destruction through pestilence led to another series of actions in which we were again beaten and the secession armies found themselves hard by the very station which they had so long held after their victory at bull run had their numbers been half large we estimated them by way of accounting our defeats they could have marched into washington and the american union would have been at an end while the southern confederacy would have taken the place which the united states had possessed among the nations fortunately the enemy were not strong enough to hazard everything upon one daring stroke general lee was prudent or timid after his victorie s over general pope according to some authorities hannibal was after winning the ﬁeld of blood at cannae what he did however was sufﬁcient to show how serious was the danger that threatened us if he could not take washington which stood rome he might take baltimore which should be capua he entered maryland and his movements struck dismay into pennsylvania harrisbur g was marked seizure and the archives of the second state of the union were sent to new york and philadelphia was considered so unsafe to cause men to remove articles of value thence to her ancient rival protection that the enemy

been invaded and the southrons would have fattened on the produce of her rich ﬁelds while these things were taking place in virginia and maryland fortune had proved equally unfavorable to us in the south and the southwest we had been defeated near charleston and most of our troops at port royal had been transferred to virginia charleston and mobile saw ships constantly entering their harbors bringing supplies to the secession forces wilmington and savannah were less liable to attack than some north ern towns an attack on vicksbur g had ended in federal failure by the aid of gunboats we had prevented the enemy from taking baton rouge and destroyed their arkansas but our soldiers had to abandon that town and leave it to be watched by ships while they hastened to the defence of new orleans city which they could not have held half an hour had the protecting naval force been withdrawn the southwest was mostly abandoned by our troops and the tide of war had rolled back to the banks of the ohio nashville was looked upon lost louisville was in great danger of being taken and some days there was perfect panic throughout the country respecting the fate of cincinnati the prevailing opinion being that the enemy had good chance of getting possession of that town we had of maintaining possession of it there was hardly quarter to which unionist could look without encountering something that ﬁlled his mind with vexation disappointment shame and gloom all that the most hopeful of loyal men could say was that the enemy had been made to evacuate maryland and that they had not proceeded beyond threats again st any northern state and that was ﬁne theme congratulations after seventeen months of warfare in which the rebels were to have been beaten and the union restored such was the state of affairs when six days after the battle of antietam president lincoln issued his proclamation against slavery some persons were pleased to be much astonished when it appeared they said they had been deceived they were right they were deceived they had deceived themselves the president had received their pledge of support which they with an egotism which is not uncommon with politicians had construed into pledge from him to support slavery at all hazards under all circumstances and against all comers he had given pledge either to them or to their opponents plainly man could speak he had said that his object was the nation safety either with slavery or without it the fate of slavery being with him secondary matter if any construction was to be put upon his words to greeley beyond their plainest possible meaning it was that he preferred the destruction of slavery to its conservatio n it was known that he had been an man years and he had been made president by party which was charged by its foes with being so fanatically opposed to slavery that it was ready to destroy the constitution in order to gain place from which it could hope to effect its extermination but lincoln meant neither more nor less than what he said his sole object being the overthrow of the rebels he has done more than any president would have been compelled to who should have sought to his duty douglas could have done less had he been chosen president and had rebellion followed his election we believe would have been the fact the proclamation is not an abolition not one line of it is of such matter any abolitionist would have penned though all abolitionists may be glad that it has appeared because its promulgation is step in the right direction step sure to be taken unless the ﬁrst federal efforts should also have been the last because leading to the defeat of the rebels and the return of peace the president nowhere says that he seeks the abolition of slavery the blow the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https dealt is directed against slavery in the dominions of the confederacy that confederacy claims to be nation and some of our acts amount to virtual recognition of the claim which it makes now if we were at war with an old nation of which slavery was one of the institutions it could not be said that we had not the right to offer freedom to its slaves objection might be made to the proclamation of an offer of the kind but it would be based on expediency england would not accept plan that was formed half century ago the partition of the united states and which had its leading idea the proclamation of freedom to american slaves but her refusal was owing to the circumstance that she was herself great slaveholding power and she had thought of establishing precedent that might soon have been used with fatal effect against herself she did not close her ears to the proposition because she had any doubt to her right to avail herself of an offer of freedom to slaves or because she supposed that to make such an offer would be to act immorally but because it was inexpedient her to proceed to extremities with us due regard being had to her own interests had slavery been abolished in her dominions twenty years earlier she would have acted against american slavery in and probably with entire success president lincoln does not purpose going so far england could have gone with perfect propriety she could have proclaimed freedom to american slaves without limitation he has regard to the character of the war that exists and so his proclamation is not threat but warning in substance he tells the rebels that if they shall persist in their rebellion after certain date their slaves shall be made free if it shall be in his power to liberate them he gives them exactly one hundred days in which to make their election between submission and slavery and resistance and ruin and these hundred days may become noted in history those hundred days which formed the second reign of napoleon well through the consequences of the action that shall mark their course through the gravity of that action itself objections have been made to the time of issuing the proclamation why it has been asked spring it so suddenly upon the country why publish it just the tide of war was turning in our favor why not wait and see what the effect would be on the souther n mind of the victories won in maryland have knowledge of the immediate reasons that moved the president to select the of september the date of his proclamation but we can see three reasons why that day was good one the deed which thereon was done the president may have argued 1 that the american mind had been brought up to the point of emancipation under certain conditions and that if he should not avail himself of the state of opinion the opportunity afforded him might pass away never to return with equal force 2 that foreign nations might base acknowledgment of the confederacy on the defeats experienced by our armies in the last days of august on the danger of washing ton and on the advance of rebel armies to the ohio and he was determined that they should if admitting the confederacy to national rank place themselves in the position of supporters of slavery and 3 that the successes won by our army in maryland considering the disgraceful business at harper ferry were not of that pronounced character which entitles us to assert any supremacy over the enemy soldiers something like this would seem to be the process through which president lincoln arrived at the sound conclusion that the hour had come to strike heavy blow at the enemy and that he was the man the hour thus much the proclamation itself the appearance of which indicates the beginning of new period in the secession contest and shows that the american people are capable of conquering their prejudices provided their schooling shall be sufﬁciently severe and costly the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by

effect from the change of position taken by the country and the president if the same want of capacity that has hitherto characterized the war on our part is to be exhibited hereafter the proclamation might well have been levelled against the evils of intemperance against the evils of slavery never since war began has there been such imbecility displayed in waging it we have contrived to display in our attacks on the enemies of the union it used to be supposed that austria was the slowest and the most stupid of military countries but america has got ahead of austria in the art of doing worse than myriads of men and millions of money we stand before the world people to whom military success seems seldom possible and when possible rarely useful if we win victory we spend weeks in contemplating its beauties and never think of improving it had one of our generals won the battle of jena he would have rested six weeks and permitted the prussian army to reorganize instead of following it with that swiftness which alone can prevent brave men from speedily rallying after lost battle had one of them won waterloo he would not have dreamed of entering france but would have liberally given to napoleon all the time that should have been necessary his recovery from so terrible defeat they have nothing in them of the qualities even of old blücher who never was counted commander forbearance has never ceased to be virtue with them whether their slackness is of native growth or is the consequence of instructions from government it is plain that adherence to it can never lead to the conquest of the southrons there is now particular reason why it should give way to someth ing of very different character the proclamation has changed the conditions of the contest and to be defeated now driven out of the ﬁeld good and all would be far more mortifying termination of the war than it could have been if we had already failed utterly we have committed the unpardonable sin against slavery and to fail now would be to place ourselves in the same position that is held by the comm ander of ship of war who nails his colors to the mast and yet has to get them down in order to prevent his conqueror from annihilating him the action of the confederate congress with reference to the proclamation so far we have accounts of it shows that the president action has intensiﬁed the character of the conﬂict and that the enemy are preparing to ﬁght under the banner of the pirate declaring that they will show quarter because they look upon the proclamation declaring that there shall be quarter extended to them the president of the united states they say has avowed it to be his purpose to inaugurate servile war in their country and they call ﬁercely retaliation they mean by using the words servile war to convey the impression that there is to be general slaying and ravishing throughout the south on and after the ﬁrst of next january under the special patronage of the american president who has ordered his soldiers and his sailors his ships and his corps to be employed in protecting black ravishers of white women and black murderers of white children all they say is mere cant and is intended the european market which they now supply liberally with lies once they did with cotton our foolish foes in england accept every falsehood that is sent them from richmond and hence the torrent of misrepresentation that ﬂows from that city to london let it continue to ﬂow it can us harm if our action shall be in correspondence with our cause and our means if we succeed falsehood can not injure us if we fail we shall have something of more importance than libels to think of we should bear in mind that our armies are not to succeed because the slaves shall rise but that the slaves are to be freed consequence of the success of our armies that our armies may succeed there must be the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10

about it its mere publication will more put an end to the rebellion than president lincoln ﬁrst proclamation calling upon the rebels to cease their and disperse could put an end to it its future value like that of all papers that deal with the leading interests of mankind must depend altogether upon the future action of the men from whom it emanates and that of their constituents it stands where the declaration of independence stood the ﬁve years that followed its promulgation waiting its place in human annals to be prepared it by its supporters of what worth would the declaration of independence be now had it not been trenton and princeton sarato ga and yorktown of worth at all and its authors would be looked upon band of sentimental political babblers who could enunciate truths which neither they nor their countrymen had the capacity to uphold and practically to demonstrate but the declaration of independence is one of the most immortal of papers because it proved grand success and it was successful because the men who put it forth were fully competent to the grand work with the performance of which they were charged it is lincoln himself to say whether the proclamation of september 22 1861 shall take rank with the declaration of july 4 1776 or with those evidences of ﬂagrant failure that have become so common since 1789 the french declaration of the rights of man and mexican constitutions that it is the people duty to support the president is said by almost all men but is it not equally the duty of the president to support the people and have

history how to choose rifle to the editors of the atlantic monthl some thirty years ago gentleman who had just returned from europe was trying to convey an idea of the size and magniﬁcence of peter church to clergyman and was somewhat taken aback by the remark of the good man that the pope must require very powerful voice to ﬁll such building the anecdote has been brought to my mind by the unexpected position in which i am placed the recipient of such multitude of letters and from such widely separated portions of the country elicited by my article on in the atlantic september that i ﬁnd myself called upon to address an audience extending from maine to minnesota fortunately however the columns of the atlantic afford facilities of communication not enjoyed by the pope and through that medium i crave permission to reply to inquiries which afford most gratifying proof of the interest which is awakened in the subject almost every letter contains the inquiry what is the new riﬂe you allude to and where is it to be had large proportion of them also ask advice to the selection of riﬂe and with such evidence of general interest in the inquiry i have thought i could not better than to frame my reply specially to this point the riﬂe above alluded to is not yet in the market and probably will not be some time to come only three or four samples have been manufactured and after being subjected to every possible test short of actual service in the hands of troops it has proved so entirely satisfactory that preparations are now making its extensive production thus far it is known the ashcroft riﬂe from the name of the proprietor ashcroft of boston the persevering energy of whose efforts to secure its introduction will probably never be appreciated it deserves except perhaps by those who have gone through the trial of bringing out an idea involving in its conception great public beneﬁt lieutenant busk in hid hythe says i can not imagine much more helpless or hopeless position than that of an individual who having determined to expend his ten or twenty guineas in the purchase of riﬂe and guided only by the light of nature applies to respectable to supply his want i never hear of an inexperienced buyer in search of riﬂe without being reminded of the purchaser of telescope who on asking the the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10

miles off sir you can see an object thousand miles off sir can see the moon sir in like manner if you naïvely inquire of whether particular riﬂe will carry two hundred yards the chances are he will exclaim emphatically hundred yards sir it will carry ﬁfteen hundred and so doubt it may the only question is how the questions which have been addresse d to few weeks past have given keen appreciation of the difﬁculties alluded to in which multitudes are at this moment plunged to whom i shall be but too happy if it is in my power to extend helping hand at the outset however it is but fair to declare my conviction that man who has any just appreciation of the subject would attempt to choose gun another any more than he would horse or i had almost said wife but he may lay down certain general rules which each individual must apply himself exercising his own taste in the details thus i have elsewhere declared my own predilection colt riﬂe and i hold to it notwithstanding strong prejudice against it which very generally exists i not mean to assert that it is better shooter than many others and still less would i urge any one else to procure one because i like it but i simply say that its performance is equal to my requirements and that the whole construction and of the gun suit my fancy and the fact that another man dislikes it is reason why i should discard it i have known men who were continually changing their guns and seemed satisﬁed only with novelties with such taste i have sympathy but on the contrary my feeling of attachment to trusty weapon strengthen s with my familiarity with its merits till it becomes so near akin to affection that i should ﬁnd it hard to part with one which had served well and was associated in my mind with adventures whose interest was derived from its successful performance the ﬁrst piece of advice i would of fer to novice in search of gun is be in hurry the demand is such that buyer is constantly urged to close bargain by the assurance that it may be his last chance to secure such weapon the one he is examining great numbers of mere toys have thus been forced upon purchasers who if they ever practise enough to acquire taste shooting will send them to the and make another effort to procure gun suited to their wants several new patterns of guns have been produced within the last year some of which are very attractive in their appearance and to an inexperienced person seem to possess sufﬁcient power any service they may ever be called upon to perform they are well ﬁnished compact light and pretty government inspector indeed would be apt to make discoveries of malleable iron which would cause their instant rejection but which in reality constitute s ground of objection to guns whose parts are not required to be interchangeable they might be described well adapted ladies use or boys learning to shoot but it gave sickening sense of the inexperience of many hearted youth who may have entered the service from the purest motives of patriotism when dealer who was exhibiting one of these parlor with calibre larger than sized pea informed that he had sold great many to young ofﬁcers being so light that they could be carried slung upon the back almost easily pistol it is with such tools these that so many of our ofﬁcers have been picked off by southern the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https long range they are useless at close quarters which is the only situation in which an ofﬁcer actually needs revolver is far preferable i know of riﬂe so well adapted to an ofﬁcer use colt carbine eight een or inch barrel and not less than of an inch calibre it may be depended upon six hundred yards the short barrel renders its manipulation easy in close ﬁght and the value of the repeating principle at such time can be estimated only by that of life in perfectly calm atmosphere the light guns i have alluded to will shoot very well one or two hundred yards but one can conceive till he proves it by actual trial what an amazing difference in precision is the result of even very slight increase of weight of ball when the air is in motion even in dead calm satisfactory shooting can be done beyond two hundred yards with lighter ball than half an ounce and any one who becomes interested in will soon grow impatien t of being conﬁned to short ranges and calm weather this brings us then to the question of calibre which i conceive to be the ﬁrst one to be decided in selecting gun and the decision rests upon the uses to which the gun is to be applied if it is wanted merely military service nothing better than the enﬁeld can be procured but if the purchaser proposes to study the niceties of practice and to enter into it with keen zest he will need very different style of gun calibre large enough round ball of ﬁfty to the pound or an elongated shot of about half an ounce is sufﬁcient six hundred yards and gun of that calibr with barrel and weig ht of about ten pounds is better suited to the general wants of purchasers than any other size in this part of the country it is by means easy to ﬁnd place where shooting can be safely practised even at so long range ﬁve hundred yards is sixty yards more than quarter of mile it is always necessary to have an attendant at the target to point out the shots and even then the shooter needs telescope to distinguish them ordinary purposes therefor the calibre i have indicated is but if gun is wanted shooting up to one thousand yards the shot should be full ounce weight these are points which each man must determine himself and having done so let him go to any of established reputation and before giving his order let him study and compare the different forms of stocks till he ﬁnds what is required his peculiar physical conformation giving directions accordingly he will probably secure weapon whose merits he will not fully appreciate till he has attained degree of skill which is the result only of practice but never buy gun and least of all riﬂe without trying it and not be satisﬁed with trial in shop or shooting gallery but take it into the ﬁeld and if you distrust yourself get some one in whom you have conﬁdence to try it you choose perfectly calm day have rest prepared on which not only the gun may be laid but support may also be had the elbows the shooter being seated by this means and with the aid of and which should always be used in trying gun it may certainly be held in the same position at every shot if it were clamped in machine your target take sheet of and draw on it circle of foot and inside of that another of four inches in diameter paint the space between the rings black and you will then have black ring four inches wide surrounding white against which your will be much more distinctly seen than if it were black place the target so that when shooting you may have the sun on your back on very bright day brown paper is better target than white begin shooting at one hundred yards and ﬁre ten shots with an exact aim at the wiping out the gun after each shot not look to see where you hit till you have ﬁred your string of the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https if you you will be tempted to alter your aim and make allowance the variation whereas your object now is not to hit the but to prove the shooting of the gun and if you ﬁnd when you get through that all the shots are close together you may be sure the gun shoots well though they may be at considerable distance from the that would only prove that the line of sight was not coincident with the line of ﬁre which can be easily rectiﬁed by moving the forward sight to the right or left according the variation was on the one side or the other having ﬁred your string of ten shots take pair of dividers and with radius equal to half the distance between the two hits most distant from each other describe circle cutting through the centre of each of those hits from the centre of this circle measure the distance to each of the hits add these distances together and divide the sum by ten and you have the average variation which ought not to be over two inches at the utmost and if the gun is what it ought to be and ﬁred by good marksman would probably be much less this is sufﬁcient test of the precision that distance and the same method may be adopted longer ranges but if the gun shoots well at one hundred yards its capacity longer range may be proved by its penetrating power provide number of pieces of seasoned pine board one inch thick and say two feet long by sixteen inches wide these are to be secured parallel to each other and one inch apart by strips nailed ﬁrmly to their sides and must be so placed that when shot at the balls may strike fairly at right angle to their face try number of shots at the distance of one hundred yards and note carefully how many boards are penetrated at each shot the elongated shots are sometimes turned in passing through board so to strike the next one sideways which of course increases the resistance very greatly and such shots should not be counted but if you ﬁnd generally that the penetration of those which strike fairly is not over six inches you may rest assured the gun can not be relied on except in dead calm more than two hundred yards and with anything of breeze you will make good shooting even at that distance nine inches of penetration is equal to six hundred yards and twelve inches is good thousand striking proof of the prevailing ignorance of scientiﬁc principles in is afforded by the fact that it is still very common practice to vary the charge of powder according to the distance to be shot the fact is that beyond certain point any increase of the initial velocity of the ball is unfavorable both to range and precision owing to the ascertained law that the ratio of increase of atmosph eric resistance is four times that of the velocity so that after the point is reached at which they balance each other any additional propulsive power is injurious the proper charge of powder any riﬂe is about the weight of the ball and the only means which should ever be adopted increasing the range is the elevating sight in conclusion i would impress upon the young riﬂeman the importance of always keeping his weapon in perfect order if you have never looked through the barrel of riﬂe you can have conception what beautifully ﬁnished instrument it is and when you learn that the accuracy of its shooting may be affected by variation of the thousandth part of an inch on its interior surface you may appreciate the necessity of guarding against the intrusion of even speck of rust never suffer your riﬂe to be laid aside after use till it has been thoroughly cleaned barrel wiped ﬁrst with wet rag is best then rubbed dry then well oiled and then again wiped with dry rag in england this work may be left to servant but with us the servants are so rare to whom such work can be intrusted that the only the

british india but granting the truth rightly read of the historical aphorism that the people always conquer it is to be noted that in the southern states the tenure of land and the local laws with slavery give the social system not democratic but an aristocratic complexion and those states have shown every year more hostile and aggressive temper until the instinct of forced us into the war and the aim of the war on our part is indicated by the aim of the president proclamation namely to break up the false combination of southern society to destroy the piratic feature in it which makes it

ﬁnd the constitution in its old place at the potomac ferry and without toll or pike to heed it seemed so sensible to say that where one document can not go another can not and yet it depends upon what is in the document if the constitution could go south now it would be the last thing we should want to send at this stage of the national malady it contains the immunity out of which the malady has ﬂamed its very neutrality is the best protection which the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https south could have and moral triumph that would richly compensate it military defeat would it not have been quite sagacious and equally aphoristic if the president had said where proclamation can not go the constitution never can again he has said it and if the proclamation goes ﬁrst the constitution will follow to bless and to save both of these little books of conway are devoted to showing the necessity proclamation of emancipation simple justice military policy mercy to the south to put us right at home and abroad to destroy at once the cause of the republic shame and sorrow he combats various objections such that proclamation of that nature would send home instantly the ofﬁcers and men who are now ﬁghting merely to enhance their own importance or to restore the state of things before the war that proclamation of emancipation ﬁnding its way it surely would to the heart of every slave would breed insurrections and all the horrors of servile war that such document would not be worth the paper which it blotted until the military power of the south was deﬁnitively broken that it would convert the border states into active foes and make them rush by natural proclivity into the bosom of secession conway disposes well of great deal of trash which even good republican papers upon which we have hitherto relied but can so longer have vented under all these heads of objections he writes with such enthusiasm and is so plainly dear lover and worshipper of the justice which can alone exalt this nation that we are carried clear over the wretched republicanism which has been trying all the year to say eminently sound and unexceptionable things we forget the deceit and expediency whose leaded columns have been more formidable than those which rolled the tide of war back again to the potomac great is the animating power of faith when faithfully brought home to the universal instinct righteousness conway was born and bred among slaveholders knows them and their institution knows the slave and his moral condition and his expectations so that these inspiriting prophecies of his are more than those of lively and talented pamphleteer his earnest purpose in writing lifts us pretty well over some things in his style which seem to us discordant with his glorious theme he has way good the president to whom much of his matter is addressed of making his apologues and stories tell they are apt and give the reader the sensation of being clinched one feels like nail when it catches the board but sometimes the transition to grotesque allusion from ﬁne touch of fancy or from the inbred religiousness of the subject is abrupt jean paul may offer you in his most glowing page quid of tobacco if he pleases the shock is picturesque and sometimes lets in deep analogy but the hour in which conway writes the height of faith from which his pen stoops to the mortal page the unspeakable solemnity of the theme which our volunteers are rudely striving to trace upon their country bosom with their blood and our women are steeping in their tears ought to drive all ﬂippancy shudderin g from the lines in which sarcasm itself should be measured and awful the deaths which gird us round but the two volumes are full of power and feeling they are written so that all may read their effect is popular without stoop ing deliberately to become so they are among the brightest and simplest pages which this exciting period has produced it would be great mistake to gauge their effect by what they bring to pass in the minds of the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https and they put into plain stout language the growing instinct of the people to get at the cause of the war which lays them waste some of the most effective pages in these volumes are those which lament the dread alternative of war and which show that emancipation would be merciful to all classes at the south it is paradox that to free the slaves would restore health to the south and regenerate its people and we are glad that conway speaks so emphatically against that measure of colonization whether the proposition be to deport the contrabands to hayti or to tote them away to central america under the leadership of intelligent colored representatives of the north all these are plans which look to the eventual removal of the only men at the south who know how to labor and who are now the only representatives there of the coun try industrial ideas we pray you president to use the money voted colonizing purposes to rid the country of the men in the border and cotton states who can not or will not work and bushwhackers who kill and harry but who never did an honest stroke of work in their lives and whom with or without slavery this republic will have to support take some paciﬁc island great and inaugurate an exodus of the genuine southern pauper he is only an incumbrance to the industrious and blacks from whose toil the country may draw the staples of free sugar and free cotton raised upon the soil which is theirs by the holy prescription of blood and sorrow if it were not your presence in the country says the president to the colored men we should have war if it were not silverware and jewelry burglaries would be committed let us get rid of the villains but of the victims thereby villainy will cease let pomeroy be sent to annex some of the paumotu or tongan groups where spontaneous would afford floyd good plucking and wigfall benjamin and prior could even have their chewing done by proxy the native pauper employs the old women to masticate his ava into drink there they might continue to take their food from other people mouths with the chance now and then of strong clergyman well barbecued luxury which they have howled many year that is the place your oligarchic pauper where the elements themselves are with nature overseer manufactures superﬂuous and blessing and plenty of colored persons to raise the mischief with that is the sole crop which they have raised at home let their propensities be transferred to place unconnected with the politics or the privileges of christian republic but let this great republic drive into exile the of the west the miners and of pennsylvania and the farmers of new england soon these men who have created the which clothes world and who only wait another stimulus to supersede the lash let them ﬁnd it in jamaica in plot of ground their seed and tools their and marriage their freedom and the shelter of country which wants to use the products of their hands if it be an object to stretch great band of free tropical labor across central america to people those wastes with ideas which shall curb the southward lust of men and nourish grateful empire against the intrigues of european states let that be done if the colored american of the border states is willing to advance the project let the project be the project gutenberg ebook

let colonization be opened like an artery through whose unkindest cut some of the best blood of the country shall slip away and be lost forever we want the cotton labor even more extensively diffused to conquer john bull with bales at new orleans let ever budge the life and letters of washington irving by his nephew pierre irving vols i and ii new york putnam if to be loved and admired by all to have troops of personal friends to enjoy literary reputation wide in extent and high in degree to be little stung by envy and detraction the lot of humanity will permit to secure material prosperity with only occasional interruptions and intermissions make up the elements of happy life then that of washington irving must be pronounced one of the most fortunate in the annals of literature it is but repeating trite remark to say that happiness depends more upon organization than upon circum stances more upon what we are than upon what we have said of the duke of burgundy father of louis that he was born terrible it certainly may be said of washington irving that he was born happy some men are born unhappy that is they are born with elements of character peculiarities of temperament which generate discontent under all conditions of life their joints are not lubricated by oil but frette d by sand the contemporaries of shakspeare who the most part had little comprehension of his unrivalled genius expressed their sense of his personal qualities by the epithet gentle which was generally applied to him word which meant rather more then than it does now comprising sweetness courtesy and kindliness one word could better designate the leading characteristics of irving nature and temperament man was ever more worthy to bear the grand old name of gentleman alike in the essentials of manliness tenderness and purity and in the external accomplishment of manners so winning and cordial that they charmed alike men women and children he had the delicacy of organization which is essential to literary genius but it stopped short of sickliness or irritability he was sensitive to beauty in all its forms but was never made unhappy or annoyed by the shadows in the picture of life he had happy power of escaping from everything that was distasteful uncomfortable and unlovely and dwelling in regions of sunshine and bloom his temperament was not impassioned and this though it may have impaired somewhat the force of his genius contributed much to his enjoyment of life considering that he was an american born and that his youth and early manhood were passed in period of bitter and virulent political strife it is remarkable how free his writings are from the elements of conﬂict and opposition he never put any vinegar into his ink he seems to have been absolutely without the capacity of hating any living thing he was literary artist and the productions of his pen address themselves to the universal and unpartisan sympathies of mank ind much paintings or statues his rip van winkle and legend of sleepy hollow are pictures in which we ﬁnd combined the handling of teniers the reﬁnement of stothard and the coloring of gainsborough fortunate in so many other things irving may also be pronounced fortunate in his biographer whom he himself designated the trust his nephew has performed his labor of love in manner which will satisfy all but those who read book mainly the purpose of ﬁnding fault with it in his brief and tasteful preface he says in the delicate ofﬁce of the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https and arranging these different materials extending through period of nearly sixty years it has been my aim to make the author in every stage of his career far possible his own biographer conscious that i shall in this way best fulﬁl the duty devolved upon and give to the world the truest picture of his life and character to this purpose pierre irving has adhered with uniform consistency he makes his uncle his own biographer to borrow happy illustration which we found in newspaper few days since his own portion of the book is like the crystal of watch through which we see the hands upon the face through transparent air and luckily he found ample materials in his uncle papers and records washington irving was not bred to any profession and had ﬁxed aversion not characteristic of his countrymen regular busines his literary industry was ﬁtful and not continuous but he seems to have been fond of the occupation of writing and spent upon his diaries and in his correspondence great many hours which he could hardly have done if he had been lawyer doctor or even merchant in active employment his warm affections too his strong love his brothers and sisters from most of whom he was many years separated were constant incitement to the writing of letters those invisible wires that keep up the communication between parted hearts all these peculiarities of nature all these accidents of fortune we have reason to be grateful since from these his biographer has found ample materials constructing the fabric of his life from the foundation many of irving letters especially in the second volume are long and elaborate productions which read like chapters from book of travels or like essays and yet not on that account lose the peculiar charm which we demand in such productions they are perfectly natural in tone and feeling though evidently written with some care they are not in the least artiﬁcial and yet not careless or hasty they have all that easy and graceful ﬂow that transparent narrative that unconscious charm which we ﬁnd in his published writings and we not unfrequently discern gleams and touches of that exquisite humor which was the best gift bestowed upon his mind brief our notice is we can not refrain from quoting in illustration of our remark few sentences from letter to thomas moore written in 1824 i went few evenings since to see kenney new piece alcaid it went off lamely and the alcaid is rather bore and comes near to be generally thought so poor kenney came to my room next evening and i could not have believed that one night could have ruined man so completely i swear to you i though t at ﬁrst it was ﬂimsy suit of clothes had left some bedside and walked into my room without waiting the owner to get up or that it was one of those frames on which clothiers stretch coats at their until i perceived thin face sticking edgeways out of the collar of the coat like the axe in bundle of fasces he was so thin and pale and nervous and exhausted made dozen difﬁculties in getting over spot in the carpet and never would have accomplished it if he had not lifted himself over by the points of his the illustration we have italicized is rather wit than humor but be it it may it is capital and the whole paragraph has that quaint and grotesque exaggeration which reminds us of the in the who played on the clarionet and seemed to have blown his face to point or of mud sam who knew all the ﬁsh in the river by their christian names the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 10 61 november 1862 magazine of literature art and politics by https think one can read these volumes without having higher impression of washington irving man there was inconsistency between the author and the man the tenderness the purity of feeling the sensibility which gave his works an entrance into so many hearts had their source in his mind and character it is very truthful record that we have before us the delineation is that of man certainly not without touches of human inﬁrmity but certainly largely endowed with virtues well with gifts and graces it is very evident that it is truthful biography and that the hand of faithful affection has found nothing to suppress or conceal when we have laid down the book we feel that we know the man and we can understand why it was that he was so loved enemies it seems he had or at least since we it is one of the indications of his soft and sensitive he was seriously annoyed by persecutor who persistently inclosed and forwarded to him every scrap of unfavorable criticism he could ﬁnd in the newspapers but the feeling that inspired this piece of must have been envy and not hatred bitterness which is awakened in some unhappy tempers by the success which they can not themselves attain man less deserved to be hated than irving man was less willing himself to give to hatred we need hardly add that these which the larger part is by irving very entertaining and that we read them from beginning to end with unﬂagging interest sketches of society and manners personal anecdotes descriptions of scenery buildings and works of art give animation and variety to the narrative the whole is suffused with golden glow of cheerfulness the efﬂuence of nature very happy yet never needing the sting of riot or craving the ﬂush of excess and ﬁnding its happiness in those pure fountains that refresh but not intoxicate the close of the second volume brings us down to the year 1832 and his cordial reception by his friends and countrymen
