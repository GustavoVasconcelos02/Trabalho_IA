erudition and painstaking care it stands perpetual monument the age of fable has come to be ranked with older books like pilgrim progress gulliver travels the arabian nights robinson crusoe and ﬁve or six other productions of renown work with which every one must claim some acquaintance before his education can be called really complete many readers of the present edition will probably recall coming in contact with the work children and it may be added will doubt discover from fresh perusal the source of numerous bits of knowledge that have remained stored in their minds since those early years yet to the majority of this great circle of readers and students the name bulﬁnch in itself has signiﬁcance thomas bulﬁnch was native of boston where he was born in his boyhood was spent in that city and he prepared college in the boston schools he ﬁnished his scholastic training at harvard college and after taking his degree was period teacher in his home city long time later in life he was employed an accountant in the boston merchants bank his leisure time he used further pursuit of the classical studies which he had begun at harvard and his chief pleasure in life lay in writing out the results of his reading in simple condensed form young or busy readers the plan he followed in this work to give it the greatest possible usefulness is set forth in the author preface age of fable first edition 1855 the age of chivalry 1858 the boy inventor 1860 legends of charlemagne or romance of the middle ages 1863 poetry of the age of fable 1863 oregon and eldorado or romance of the rivers in this complete edition of his mythological and legendary lore the age of fable the age of chivalry and legends of charlemagne are included scrupulous care has been taken to follow the original text of bulﬁnch but attention should be called to some additional sections which have been inserted to add to the rounded completeness of the work and which the publishers believe would meet with the sanction of the author himself in way intruding upon his original plan but simply carrying it out in more complete detail the section on northern mythology has been enlar ged by retelling of the epic of the nibelungen lied together with summary of wagner version of the legend in his series of under the head of hero myths of the british race have been included outlines of the stories of beowulf cuchulain hereward the wake and robin hood of the verse extracts which occur throughout the text thirty or more have been added from literature which has appeared since bulﬁnch time extracts that he would have been likely to quote had he personally supervised the new edition finally the index has been thoroughly overhauled and indeed remade all the proper names in the work have been entered with references to the pages where they occur and concise explanation or deﬁnition of each has been given thus what was mere list of names in the original has been enlar ged into small classical and mythological dictionary which it is hoped will prove valuable reference purposes not necessarily connected with the age of fable the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https are due the writings of oliver huckel information on the point of wagner rendering of the nibelungen legend and ebbutt authoritative volume on hero myths and legends of the british race from which much of the information concerning the british heroes has been obtained author pref ace if other knowledge deserves to be called useful but that which helps to enlar ge our possessions or to raise our station in society then mythology has claim to the appellation but if that which tends to make us happier and better can be called useful then we claim that epithet our subject mythology is the handmaid of literature and literature is one of the best allies of virtue and promoters of happiness without knowledge of mythology much of the elegant literature of our own language can not be understood and appreciated when byron calls rome the niobe of nations or says of venice she looks fresh from ocean he calls up to the mind of one familiar with our subject illustrations more vivid and striking than the pencil could furnish but which are lost to the reader ignorant of mythology milton abounds in similar allusions the short poem comus contains more than thirty such and the ode on the morning of the nativity half many through paradise lost they are scattered profusely this is one reason why we often hear persons by means illiterate say that they can not enjoy milton but were these persons to add to their more solid acquirements the easy learning of this little volume much of the poetry of milton which has appeared to them harsh and crabbed would be found musical is apollo lute our citations taken from more than poets from spenser to longfellow will show how general has been the practice of borrowing illustrations from mythology the prose writers also avail themselv es of the same source of elegant and suggestive illustration one can hardly take up number of the edinbur gh or quarterly review without meeting with instances in macaulay article on milton there are twenty such but how is mythology to be taught to one who does not learn it through the medium of the languages of greece and rome to devote study to species of learning which relates wholly to false marvels and obsolete faiths is not to be expected of the general reader in practical age like this the time even of the young is claimed by so many sciences of facts and things that little can be spared set treatises on science of mere fancy but may not the requisite knowledge of the subject be acquired by reading the ancient poets in translations we reply the ﬁeld is too extensive preparatory course and these very translations require some previous knowledge of the subject to make them intelligible let the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https who doubts it read the ﬁrst page of the aeneid and see what he can make of the hatred of juno the decree of the parcae the judgment of paris and the honors of ganymede without this knowledge shall we be told that answers to such queries may be found in notes or by reference to the classical dictionary we reply the interruption of one reading by either process is so annoying that most readers prefer to let an allusion pass unapprehended rather than submit to it moreover such sources give us only the dry facts without any of the charm of the original narrative and what is poetical myth when stripped of its poetry the story of ceyx and halcyone which ﬁlls chapter in our book occupies but eight lines in the best smith classical dictionary and so of others our work is an attempt to solve this problem by telling the stories of mytholo gy in such manner to make them source of amusement we have endeavored to tell them correctly according to the ancient authorities so that when the reader ﬁnds them referred to he may not be at loss to recognize the reference thus we hope to teach mythology not study but relaxation from study to give our work the charm of yet by means of it to impart knowledge of an important branch of education the index at the end will adapt it to the purposes of reference and make it classical dictionary the parlor most of the classical legends in stories of gods and heroes are derived from ovid and virgil they are not literally translated in the author opinion poetry translated into literal prose is very unattractive reading neither are they in verse well other reasons from conviction that to translate faithfully under all the embarrassments of rhyme and measure is impossible the attempt has been made to tell the stories in prose preserving so much of the poetry resides in the thoughts and is separable from the language itself and omitting those ampliﬁcations which are not suited to the altered form the northern mythological stories are copied with some abridgment from mallet northern antiquities these chapters with those on oriental and egypti an mythology seemed necessary to complete the subje ct though it is believed these topics have not usually been presented in the same volume with the classical fables the poetical citations so freely introduced are expected to answer several valuab le purposes they will tend to ﬁx in memory the leading fact of each story they will help to the attainment of correct pronunciation of the proper names and they will enrich the memory with many gems of poetry some of them such are most frequently quoted or alluded to in reading and conversation having chosen mythology connected with literature our province we have endeavored to omit nothing which the reader of elegant literature is likely to ﬁnd occasion such stories and parts of stories are offensive to pure taste and good morals are not given but such stories are not often referred to and if they occasionally should be the english reader need feel mortiﬁcation in confessing his ignorance of them our work is not the learned nor the theologian nor the philosophe r but the reader of english literature of either sex who wishes to comprehend the allusions the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https made by public speakers lecturers essayists and poets and those which occur in polite conversation in the stories of gods and heroes the compiler has endeavored to impart the pleasures of classical learning to the english reader by presenting the stories of pagan mythology in form adapted to modern taste in king arthur and his knights and the mabinogeon the attempt has been made to treat in the same way the stories of the second age of fable the age which witnessed the dawn of the several states of modern europe it is believed that this presentation of literature which held unrivalled sway over the imaginations of our ancestors many centuries will not be without beneﬁt to the reader in addition to the amusement it may afford the tales though not to be trusted their facts are worthy of all credit pictures of manne rs and it is beginning to be held that the manners and modes of thinking of an age are more important part of its history than the conﬂicts of its peoples generally leading to result besides this the literature of romance is house of poetical material to which modern poets frequently resort the italian poets dante and ariosto the english spenser scott and tennyson and our own longfellow and lowell are examples of this these legends are so connected with each other so consistently adapted to group of characters strongly individualized in arthur launcelot and their compeers and so lighted up by the ﬁres of imagination and invention that they seem well adapted to the poet purpose the legends of the greek and roman mythology and if every young person is expected to know the story of the golde n fleece why is the quest of the sangreal less worthy of his acquaintance or if an allusion to the shield of achilles ought not to pass unapprehended why should one to excalibar the famous sword of arthur of arthur who to upper light restored w ith that terriﬁc sword which yet he brandishes future war shall lift his country fame above the polar star footnote wordsworth it is an additional recommendation of our subject that it tends to cherish in our minds the idea of the source from which we sprung we are entitled to our full share in the glories and recollections of the land of our forefathers down to the time of colonization thence the associations which spring from this source must be fruitful of good inﬂuences among which not the least valuable is the increased enjoyment which such associations afford to the american traveller when he visits england and sets his foot upon any of her renowned localities the legends of charlemagne and his peers are necessary to complete the subject in an age when intellectual darkness enveloped western europe constellation of brilliant writers arose in italy of these pulci born in 1432 boiardo 1434 and ariosto 1474 took their subjects the romantic fables which had many ages been transmitted in the lays of bards and the legends of monkish chroniclers these fables they arranged in order adorned with the embellishments of fancy ampliﬁed from their own invention and stamped the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https it may safely be asserted that long civilization shall endure these productions will retain their place among the most cherished creations of human genius in stories of gods and heroes king arthur and his knights and the mabinogeon the aim has been to supply to the modern reader such knowledge of the fables of classical and mediaeval literature is needed to render intelligible the allusions which occur in reading and conversation the legends of charlemagne is intended to carry out the same design like the earlier portions of the work it aspires to higher character than that of piece of mere amusement it claims to be useful in acquainting its readers with the subjects of the productions of the great poets of italy some knowledge of these is expected of every educated young person in reading these romances we can not fail to observe how the primitive inventions have been used again and again by successive generations of fabulists the siren of ulysses is the prototype of the siren of orlando and the character of circe reappears in alcina the fountains of love and hatred may be traced to the story of cupid and psyche and similar effects produced by magic draught appear in the tale of tristram and isoude and substituting ﬂower the draught in shakspeare midsummer night dream there are many other instances of the same kind which the reader will recognize without our assistance the sources whence we derive these stories are ﬁrst the italian poets named above next the romans chevalerie of the comte tressan lastly certain german collections of popular tales some chapters have been borrowed from leigh hunt translations from the italian poets it seemed unnecessary to over again what he had

the religions of ancient greece and rome are extinct the called divinities of olympus have not single worshipper among living men they belong now not to the department of theology but to those of literature and taste there they still hold their place and will continue to hold it they are too closely connected with the ﬁnest productions of poetr y and art both ancient and modern to pass into oblivion we propose to tell the stories relating to them which have come down to us from the ancients and which are alluded to by modern poets essayists and orators our readers may thus at the same time be entertained by the most charming ﬁctions which fancy has ever created and put in possession of information indispensable to every one who would read with intelligence the elegant literature of his own day in order to understand these stories it will be necessary to acquaint ourselves with the ideas of the structure of the universe which prevailed among the people from whom the romans and other nations through them received their science and religion the greeks believed the earth to be ﬂat and circular their own country occupying the middle of it the central point being either mount olympus the abode of the gods or delphi so famous its oracle the circular disk of the earth was crosse d from west to east and divided into two equal parts by the sea they called the mediterranean and its continuation the euxine the only seas with which they were acquainted around the earth ﬂowed the river ocean its course being from south to north on the western side of the earth and in contrary direction on the eastern side it ﬂowed in steady equable current unvexed by storm or tempest the sea and all the rivers on earth received their waters from it the northern portion of the earth was supposed to be inhabited by happy race named the hyperboreans dwelling in everlasting bliss and spring beyond the lofty mountains whose caverns were supposed to send forth the piercing blasts of the north wind which chilled the people of hellas greece their country was inaccessible by land or sea they lived exempt from disease or old age from toils and warfare moore has given us the song of hyperborean beginning i come from land in the deep where golden gardens glow where the winds of the north becalmed in sleep their conch shells never blow the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https the south side of the earth close to the stream of ocean dwelt people happy and virtuous the hyperboreans they were named the aethiopians the gods favored them so highly that they were wont to leave at times their olympian abodes and go to share their sacriﬁces and banquets on the western margin of the earth by the stream of ocean lay happy place named the elysian plain whither mortals favored by the gods were transported without tasting of death to enjoy an immortality of bliss this happy region was also called the fortunate fields and the isles of the blessed we thus see that the greeks of the early ages knew little of any real people except those to the east and south of their own coun try or near the coast of the medite rranean their imagination meantime peopled the western portion of this sea with giants monsters and enchantresses while they placed around the disk of the earth which they probably regarded of great width nations enjoying the peculiar favor of the gods and blessed with happiness and longevity the dawn the sun and the moon were supposed to rise out of the ocean on the eastern side and to drive through the air giving light to gods and men the stars also except those forming the wain or bear and others near them rose out of and sank into the stream of ocean there the embarked in winged boat which conveyed him round by the

the goddesses named the seasons opened to permit the passage of the celestials to earth and to receive them on their return the gods had their separate dwellings but all when summoned repaired to the palace of jupiter did also those deities whose usual abode was the earth the waters or the underworld it was also in the great hall of the palace of the olympian king that the gods feasted each day on ambrosia and nectar their food and drink the latter being handed round by the lovely goddess hebe here they conversed of the affairs of heaven and earth and they quaffed their nectar apollo the god of music delighted them with the tones of his lyre to which the muses sang in responsive strains when the sun was set the gods retired to sleep in their respective dwellings the following lines from the

called ophion with eurynome the encroaching eve perhaps had ﬁrst the rule of high olympus thence by saturn driven the representations given of saturn are not very consistent on the one hand his reign is said to have been the golden age of innocence and purity and on the other he is described monster who devoured his children footnote this inconsistency arises from considering the saturn of the

city of eleusis then the home of an old man named celeus he was out in the ﬁeld gathering acorns and blackberries and sticks his ﬁre his little girl was driving home their two goats and she passed the goddess who appeared in the guise of an old woman she said to her mother the name was sweet to the ears of ceres why you sit here alone upon the rocks the old man also stopped though his load was heavy and begged her to come into his cottage such it was she declined and he urged her go in peace she replied and be happy in your daughter i have lost mine she spoke something like tears the gods never down her cheeks upon her bosom the compassionate old man and his child wept with her then said he come with us and despise not our humble roof so may your daughter be restored to you in safety lead on said she i can not resist that appeal so she rose from the stone and went with them they walked he told her that his only son little boy lay very sick feverish and sleepless she stooped and gathered some poppies they enter ed the cottage they found all in great distress the boy seemed past hope of recovery metanira his mother received her kindly and the goddess stooped and kissed the lips of the sick child instantly the paleness left his face and healthy vigor returned to his body the whole family were delighted is the father mother and little girl they were all they had servan ts they spread the table and put upon it curds and cream apples and honey in the comb while they ate ceres mingled poppy juice in the milk of the boy when night came and all was still she arose and taking the sleeping boy moulded his limbs with her hands and uttered over him three times solemn charm then went and laid him in the ashes his mother who had been watching what her guest was doing sprang forward with cry and snatched the child from the ﬁre then ceres assumed her own form and divine splendor shone all around while they were overcome with astonishment she said mother you have been cruel in your fondness to your son i would have made him immortal but you have frustrated my attempt nevertheless he shall be great and useful he shall teach men the use of the plough and the rewards which labor can win from the cultivated soil so saying she wrapped cloud about her and mounting her chariot rode away ceres continued her search her daughter passing from land to land and across seas and rivers till at length she returned to sicily whence she at ﬁrst set out and stood by the banks of the river cyane where pluto made himself passage with his prize to his own dominions the river nymph would have told the goddess all she had witnessed but dared not fear of pluto so she only ventured to take up the girdle which proserpine had dropped in her ﬂight and waft it to the feet of the mother ceres seeing this was longer in doubt of her loss the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https did not yet know the cause and laid the blame on the innocent land ungrateful soil said she which i have endowed with fertility and clothed with herbage and nourishing grain more shall you enjoy my favors then the cattle died the plough broke in the furrow the seed failed to come up there was too much sun there was too much rain the birds stole the thistles and brambles were the only growth seeing this the fountain arethusa interceded the land goddess said she blame not the land it opened unwillingly to yield passage to your daughter i can tell you of her fate i have seen her this is not my native country i came hither from elis i was woodland nymph and delighted in the chase they praised my beauty but i cared nothing it and rather boasted of my hunting exploits one day i was returning from the wood heated with exercise when i came to stream silently ﬂowing so clear that you might count the pebbles on the bottom the willows shaded it and the grassy bank sloped down to the water edge i approached i touched the water with my foot i stepped in and not content with that i laid my garments on the willows and went in while i sported in the water i heard an indistinct murmur coming up out of the depths of the stream and made haste to escape to the nearest bank the voice said you ﬂy arethusa i am alpheus the god of this stream i ran he pursued he was not more swift than i but he was stronger and gained upon my strength failed at last exhausted i cried help to diana goddess help your votary the goddess heard and wrapped suddenly in thick cloud the river god looked now this way and now that and twice came close to but could not ﬁnd arethusa he cried oh how i trembled lamb that hears the wolf growling outside the fold cold sweat came over my hair ﬂowed down in streams where my foot stood there was pool in short in less time

such became queen of erebus the powerful bride of the monarch of the realms of the dead when ceres heard this she stood while like one stupeﬁed then turned her chariot towards heaven and hastened to present herself before the throne of jove she told the story of her bereavement and implored jupiter to interfere to procure the restitution of her daughter jupiter consented on one condition namely that proserpine should not during her stay in the lower world have taken any food otherwise the fates forbade her release accordingly mercury was sent accompanied by spring to demand proserpine of pluto the wily monarch consented but alas the maiden had taken pomegranate which pluto offered her and had sucked the sweet pulp from few of the seeds this was enough to prevent her complete release but compromise was made by which she was to pass half the time with her mother and the rest with her husband pluto ceres allowed herself to be paciﬁed with this arrangement and restored the earth to her favor now she remembered celeus and his family and her promise to his infant son triptolemus when the boy grew up she taught him the use of the plough and how to sow the seed she took him in her chariot drawn by winged dragons through all the countries of the earth imparting to mankind valuable grains and the knowledge of agriculture after his return triptolemus built magniﬁcent temple to

his charmed mother who turns to greet the tidings with kiss glaucus and scylla glaucus was ﬁsherman one day he had drawn his nets to land and had taken great many ﬁshes of various kinds so he emptied his net and proceeded to sort the ﬁshes on the grass the place where he stood was beautiful island in the river solitary spot uninhabited and not used pasturage of cattle nor ever visited by any but himself on sudden the ﬁshes which had been laid on the grass began to revive and move their ﬁns if they were in the water and while he looked on astonished they one and all moved off to the water plunged in and swam away he did not know what to make of this whether some god had done it or some secret power in the herbage what herb has such power he exclaimed and gathering some of it he tasted it scarce had the juices of the plant reached his palate when he found himself agitated with longing desire the water he could longer restrain himself but bidding farewell to earth he plunged into the stream the gods of the wate r received him graciously and admitted him to the honor of their society they obtained the consent of oceanus and tethys the sovereigns of the sea that all that was mortal in him should be washed away hundred rivers poured their waters over him then he lost all sense of his former nature and all consciousness when he recovered he found himself changed in form and mind his hair was and trailed behind him on the water his shoulders grew broad and what had been thighs and legs assumed the form of ﬁsh tail the gods complimented him on the change of his appearance and he fancied himself rather looking personage one day glaucus saw the beautiful maiden scylla the favorite of the water rambling on the shore and when she had found sheltered nook laving her limbs in the clear water he fell in love with her and showing himself on the surface spoke to her saying the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https he thought most likely to win her to stay she turned to run immediately on the sight of him and ran till she had gained cliff overlooking the sea here she stopped and turned round to see whether it was god or sea animal and observed with wonder his shape and color glaucus partly emer ging from the water and supporting himself again st rock said maiden i am monster nor sea animal but god and neither proteus nor triton ranks higher than once i was mortal and followed the sea living but now i belong wholly to it then he told the story of his metamorphosis and how he had been promoted to his present dignity and added but what avails all this if it fails to move your heart he was going on in this strain but scylla turned and hastened away glaucus was in despair but it occurred to him to consult the enchantress circe accordingly he repaired to her same where afterwards ulysses landed we shall see in one of our later stories after mutual salutations he said goddess i entreat your pity you alone can relieve the pain i suffer the power of herbs i know well any one it is to them i owe my change of form i love scylla i am ashamed to tell you how i have sued and promised to her and how scornfully she has treated i beseech you to use your incantations or potent herbs if they are more prevailing not to cure of my love that i not wish to make her share it and yield like return to which circe replied she was not insensible to the attractions of the deity you had better pursue willing object you are worthy to be sought instead of having to seek in vain be not difﬁdent know your own worth i protest to you that even i goddess though i be and learned in the virtues of plants and spells should not know how to refuse you if she scorns you scorn her meet one who is ready to meet you half way and thus make due return to both at once to these words glaucus replied sooner shall trees grow at the bottom of the ocean and on the top of the mountains than i will cease to love scylla and her alone the goddess was indignant but she could not punish him neither did she wish to so she liked him too well so she turned all her wrath against her rival poor scylla she took plants of poisonous powers and mixed them together with incantations and charms then she passed through the crowd of gambollin g beasts the victims of her art and proceeded to the coast of sicily where scylla lived there was little bay on the shore to which scylla used to resort in the heat of the day to breathe the air of the sea and to bathe in its waters here the goddess poured her poisonous mixture and muttered over it incantations of mighty power scylla came usual and plunged into the water up to her waist what was her horror to perceive brood of serpents and barking monsters surrounding her at ﬁrst she could not imagine they were part of herself and tried to run from them and to drive them away but she ran she carried them with her and when she tried to touch her limbs she found her hands touch only the yawning jaws of monsters scylla remained rooted to the spot her temper grew ugly her form and she took pleasure in devouring hapless mariners who came within her grasp thus she destroyed six of the companions of ulysses and tried to wreck the ships of aeneas till at last she was turned into rock and such still continues to be terror to mariners keats in his endymion has given new version of the ending of glaucus and scylla glaucus consents to circe blandishments till he by chance is witness to her transactions with her beasts disgusted with her treachery and cruelty he tries to escape from her but is taken and brought back when with reproache s she banishes him sentencing him to pass the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https in decrepitude and pain he

in women that he came at last to abhor the sex and resolved to live unmarried he was sculptor and had made with wonderful skill statue of ivory so beautiful that living woman came anywhere near it it was indeed the perfect semblance of maiden that seemed to be alive and only prevented from moving by modesty his art was so perfect that it concealed itself and its product looked like the workmanship of nature pygmalion admired his own work and at last fell in love with the counterfeit creation oftentimes he laid his hand upon it if to assure himself whether it were living or not and could not even then believe that it was only ivory he caressed it and gave it presents such young girls love shells and polished stones little birds and ﬂowers of various hues beads and amber he put raiment on its limbs and jewels on its ﬁngers and necklace about its neck to the ears he hung earrings and strings of pearls upon the breast her dress became her and she looked not less charming than when unattired he laid her on couch spread the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https of tyrian dye and called her his wife and put her head upon pillow of the softest feathers if she could enjoy their softness the festival of venus was at festival celebrated with great pomp at cyprus victims were offered the altars smoked and the odor of incense ﬁlled the air when pygmalion had performed his part in the solemnities he stood before the altar and timidly said ye gods who can all things give i pray you my wife dared not say my ivory virgin but said one like my ivory virgin venus who was present at the festival heard him and knew the thought he would have uttered and an omen of her favor caused the ﬂame on the altar to shoot up thrice in ﬁery point into the air when he returned home he went to see his statue and leaning over the couch gave kiss to the mouth it seemed to be warm he pressed its lips again he laid his hand upon the limbs the ivory felt soft to his touch and yielded to his ﬁngers like the wax of hymettus while he stands astonished and glad though doubting and fears he may be mistaken again and again with lover ardor he touches the object of his hopes it was indeed alive the veins when pressed yielded to the ﬁnger and again resumed their roundness then at last the votary of venus found words to thank the goddess and pressed his lips upon lips real his own the virgin felt the kisses and blushed and opening her timid eyes to the light ﬁxed them at the same moment on her lover venus blessed the nuptials she had formed and from this union paphos was born from whom the city sacred to venus received its name schiller in his poem the ideals applies this tale of pygmalion to the love of nature in youthful heart the following translation is furnished by friend once with prayers in passion ﬂowing pygmalion embraced the stone till from the frozen marble glowing the light of feeling him shone so did i clasp with young devotion bright nature to poet heart till breath and warmth and vital motion seemed through the statue form to dart and then in all my ardor sharing the silent form expression found returned my kiss of youthful daring and understood my heart quick sound then lived the bright creation the silver rill with song was rife the trees the roses shared sensation an echo of my boundless life dryope dryope and iole were sisters the former was the wife of andraemon beloved by her husband and happy in the birth of her ﬁrst child one day the sisters strolled to the bank of the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https that sloped gradually down to the water edge while the upland was overgrown with myrtles they were intending to gather ﬂowers forming garlands the altars of the nymphs and dryope carried her child at her bosom precious burden and nursed him she walked near the water grew lotus plant full of purple ﬂowers dryope gathered some and offered them to the baby and iole was about to the same when she perceived blood dropping from the places where her sister had broken them off the stem the plant was other than the nymph lotis who running from base pursuer had been changed into this form this they learned from the country people when it was too late dryope horror when she perceived what she had done would gladly have hastened from the spot but found her feet rooted to the ground she tried to pull them away but moved nothing but her upper limbs the woodiness crept upward and by degrees invested her body in anguish she attempted to tear her hair but found her hands ﬁlled with leaves the infant felt his mother bosom begin to harden and the milk cease to ﬂow iole looked on at the sad fate of her sister and could render assistance she embraced the growing trunk if she would hold back the advancing wood and would gladly have been enveloped in the same bark at this moment andraemon the husband of dryope with her father approached and when they asked dryope iole pointed them to the lotus they embraced the trunk of the yet warm tree and showered their kisses on its leaves now there was nothing left of dryope but her face her tears still ﬂowed and fell on her leaves and while she could she spoke i am not guilty i deserve not this fate i have injured one if i speak falsely may my foliage perish with drought and my trunk be cut down and burned take this infant and give it to nurse let it often be brought and nursed under my branches and play in my shade and when he is old enough to talk let him be taught to call mother and to say with sadness mother lies hid under this bark but bid him be careful of river banks and beware how he plucks ﬂowers remembering that every bush he sees may be goddess in disguise farewell dear husband and sister and father if you retain any love let not the axe wound nor the ﬂocks bite and tear my branches since i can not stoop to you climb up hither and kiss and while my lips continue to feel lift up my child that i may kiss him i can speak more already the bark advances up my neck and will soon shoot over you need not close my eyes the bark will close them without your aid then the lips ceased to move and life was extinct but the branches retained some time longer the vital heat keats in endymion alludes to dryope thus she took lute from which there pulsing came lively prelude fashioning the way in which her voice should wander was lay more more than dryope lone lulling of her child etc venus and adonis venus playing one day with her boy cupid wounded her bosom with one of his arrows she pushed him away but the wound was deeper than she thought before it healed she beheld adonis and was captivated with him she longer took any interest in her favorite the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https and cnidos and amathos rich in metals she absented herself even from heaven adonis was dearer to her than heaven him she followed and bore him company she who used to love to recline in the shade with care but to cultivate her charms now rambles through the woods and over the hills dressed like the huntress diana and calls her dogs and chases hares and stags or other game that it is safe to hunt but keeps clear of the wolves and bears reeking with the slaughter of the herd she charged adonis too to beware of such dangerous animals be brave towards the timid said she courage against the courageous is not safe beware how you expose yourself to danger and put my happiness to risk attack not the beasts that nature has armed with weapons i not value your glory so high to consent to purchase it by such exposure your youth and the beauty that charms venus will not touch the hearts of lions and bristly boars think of their terrible claws and prodigious strength i hate the whole race of them you ask why then she told him the story of atalanta and hippomenes who were changed into lions their ingratitude to her having given him this warning she mounted her chariot drawn by swans and drove away through the air but adonis was too noble to heed such counsels the dogs had roused wild boar from his lair and the youth threw his spear and wounded the animal with sidelong stroke the beast drew out the weapon with his jaws and rushed after adonis who turned and ran but the boar overtook him and buried his tusks in his side and stretched him dying upon the plain venus in her chariot had not yet reached cyprus when she heard coming up through the groans of her beloved and turned her coursers back to earth she drew near and saw from on high his lifeless body bathed in blood she alighted and bending over it beat her breast and tore her hair reproaching the fates she said yet theirs shall be but partial triumph memorials of my grief shall endure and the spectacle of your death my adonis and of my lamentations shall be annually renewed your blood shall be changed into ﬂower that consolation none can envy thus speaking she sprinkled nectar on the blood and they mingled bubbles rose in pool on which raindrops fall and in an hour time there sprang up ﬂower of bloody hue like that of the pomegranate but it is it is said the wind blows the blossoms open and afterwards blows the petals away so it is called anemone or wind flower from the cause which assists equally in its production and its decay milton alludes to the story of venus and adonis in his comus beds of hyacinth and roses where young adonis oft reposes w axing well of his deep wound in slumber soft and on the ground sadly sits th assyrian queen etc apollo and hyacinthus apollo was passionately fond of youth named hyacinthus he accompanie d him in his sports carried the nets when he went ﬁshing led the dogs when he went to hunt followed him in his excursions in the mountains and neglected him his lyre and his arrows one day they played game of quoits together and apollo heaving aloft the discus with strength the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https skill sent it high and far hyacinth us watched it it ﬂew and excited with the sport ran forward to seize it eager to make his throw when the quoit bounded from the earth and struck him in the forehead he fainted and fell the god pale himself raised him and tried all his art to stanch the wound and retain the ﬂitting life but all in vain the hurt was past the power of medicine when one has broken the stem of lily in the garden it hangs its head and turns its ﬂowers to the earth so the head of the dying boy if too heavy his neck fell over on his shoulder thou diest hyacinth so spoke phoebus robbed of thy youth by thine is the suffering mine the crime would that i could die thee but since that may not be thou shalt live with in memory and in song my lyre shall celebrate thee my song shall tell thy fate and thou shalt become ﬂower inscribed with my regrets while apollo spoke behold the blood which had ﬂowed on the ground and stained the herbage ceased to be blood but ﬂower of hue more beautiful than the tyrian sprang up resembling the lily if it were not that this is purple and that silvery white footnote it is evidently not our modern hyacinth that is here described it is perhaps some species of iris or perhaps of larkspur or of pansy and this was not enough phoebus but to confer still greater honor he marked the petals with his sorrow and inscribed ah ah upon them we see to this day the ﬂower bears the name of hyacinthus and with every returning spring revives the memory of his fate it was said that zephyrus the west wind who was also fond of hyacinthus and jealous of his preference of apollo blew the quoit out of its course to make it strike hyacinthus keats alludes to this in his endymion where he describes the at the game of quoits or they might watch the intent on either side pitying the sad death of hyacinthus when the cruel breath of zephyr slew him zephyr penitent who now ere phoebus mounts the ﬁrmament fondles the ﬂower amid the sobbing rain an allusion to hyacinthus will also be recognized in milton lycidas like to that sanguine ﬂower inscribed with woe chapter ix ceyx and halcyone or the halcyon

have you learned to feel easy in the absence of halcyone would you rather have away she also endeavored to disco urage him by describing the violence of the winds which she had known familiarly when she lived at home in her father house being the god of the winds and having much he could to restrain them they rush together said she with such fury that ﬁre ﬂashes from the conﬂict but if you must go she added dear husband let go with you otherwise i shall suffer not only the real evils which you must encounter but those also which my fears suggest these words weighed heavily on the mind of king ceyx and it was less his own wish than hers to take her with him but he could not bear to expose her to the dangers of the sea he answered therefore consoling her well he could and ﬁnished with these words i promise by the rays of my father the that if fate permits i will return before the moon shall have twice rounded her orb when he had thus spoken he ordered the vessel to be drawn out of the shiphouse and the oars and sails to be put aboard when halcyone saw these preparations she shuddered if with presentiment of evil with tears and sobs she said farewell and then fell senseless to the ground ceyx would still have lingered but now the young men grasped their oars and pulled vigorously through the waves with long and measured strokes halcyone raised her streaming eyes and saw her husband standing on the deck waving his hand to her she answered his signal till the vessel had receded so far that she could longer distinguish his form from the rest when the vessel itself could more be seen she strained her eyes to catch the last glimmer of the sail till that too disappeared then retiring to her chamber she threw herself on her solitary couch meanwhile they glide out of the harbor and the breeze plays among the ropes the seamen draw in their oars and hoist their sails when half or less of their course was passed night drew on the sea began to whiten with swelling waves and the east wind to blow gale the master gave the word to take in sail but the storm forbade obedience such is the roar of the winds and waves his orders are unheard the men of their own accord busy themselves to secure the oars to strengthen the ship to reef the sail while they thus what to each one seems best the storm increases the shouting of the men the rattling of the shrouds and the dashing of the waves mingle with the roar of the thunder the swelling sea seems lifted up to the heavens to scatter its foam among the clouds then sinking away to the bottom assumes the color of the stygian blackness the vessel shares all these changes it seems like wild beast that rushes on the spears of the hunters rain falls in torrents if the skies were coming down to unite with the sea when the lightning ceases moment the night seems to add its own darkness to that of the storm then comes the ﬂash rending the darkness asunder and lighting up all with glare skill fails courage sinks and

triumphant surge curling over looks down upon the wreck then falls and crushes it to fragments some of the seamen stunned by the stroke sink and rise more others cling to fragments of the wreck ceyx with the hand that used to grasp the sceptre holds fast to plank calling help in vain upon his father and his father but oftenest on his lips was the name of halcyone to her his thoughts cling he prays that the waves may bear his body to her sight and that it may receive burial at her hands at length the waters overwhelm him and he sinks the looked dim that night since it could not leave the heavens it shrouded its face with clouds in the meanwhile halcyone ignorant of all these horrors counted the days till her husband promised return now she gets ready the garments which he shall put on and now what she shall wear when he arrives to all the gods she offers frequent incense but more than all to juno her husband who was more she prayed incessantly that he might be safe that he might come home that he might not in his absence see any one that he would love better than her but of all these prayers the last was the only one destined to be granted the goddess at length could not bear any longer to be pleaded with one already dead and to have hands raised to her altars that ought rather to be offering funeral rites so calling iris she said iris my faithful messenger go to the

cattle nor branch moved with the wind nor sound of human conversation breaks the stillness silence reigns there but from the bottom of the rock the river lethe ﬂows and by its murmur invites to sleep poppies grow abundantly before the door of the cave and other herbs from whose juices night collects slumbers which she scatters over the darkened earth there is gate to the mansion to creak on its hinges nor any watchman but in the midst couch of black ebony adorned with black plumes and black curtains there the god reclines his limbs relaxed with sleep around him lie dreams resembling all various forms many the harvest bears stalks or the forest leaves or the seashore sand grains soon the goddess entered and brushed away the dreams that hovered around her her brightness lit up all the cave the god scarce opening his eyes and ever and anon dropping his beard upon his breast at last shook himself free from himself and leaning on his arm inquired her errand he knew who she was she answered somnus gentlest of the gods tranquillizer of minds and soother of hearts juno sends you her commands that you despatch dream to halcyone in the city of trachine representing her lost husband and all the events of the wreck the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https delivered her message iris hasted away she could not longer endure the stagnant air and she felt drowsiness creeping over her she made her escape and return ed by her bow the way she came then somnus called one of his numerous sons morpheus most expert in counterfeiting forms and in imitating the

them and when he is sound asleep slip out of bed bring forth your lamp and see yourself whether what they say is true or not if it is hesitate not to cut off the monster head and thereby recover your liberty psyche resisted these persuasions well she could but they did not fail to have their effect on her mind and when her sisters were gone their words and her own curiosity were too strong her to resist so she prepared her lamp and sharp knife and hid them out of sight of her husband when he had fallen into his ﬁrst sleep she silently rose and uncovering her lamp beheld not hideous monster but the most beautiful and charming of the gods with his golden ringlets wandering over his snow y neck and crimson cheek with two dewy wings on his shoulders whiter than snow and with shining feathers

her piety to engage them all in her behalf the holy ceres whose temple it was ﬁnding her so religiously employed thus spoke to her psyche truly worthy of our pity though i can not shield you from the frowns of venus yet i can teach you how best to allay her displeasure go then and voluntarily surrender yourself to your lady and sovereign and try by modesty and submission to win her forgiveness and

should say and how best propitiate the angry goddess feeling that the issue was doubtful and perhaps fatal venus received her with angry countenance most undutiful and faithless of servants said she you at last remember that you really have mistress or have you rather come to see your sick husband yet laid up of the wound given him by his loving wife you are so favored and disagreeable that the only way you can merit your lover must be by dint of industry and diligence i will make trial of your housewifery then she ordered psyche to be led to the storehouse of her temple where was laid up great quantity of wheat barley millet vetches beans and lentils prepared food her pigeons and said take and separate all these grains putting all of the same kind in parcel by themselves and see that you get it done before evening then venus departed and left her to her task but psyche in perfect consternation at the enormous work sat stupid and silent without moving ﬁnger to the inextricable heap while she sat despairing cupid stirred up the little ant native of the ﬁelds to take compassion on her the leader of the ant hill followed by whole hosts of his subjects approached the heap and with the utmost diligence taking grain by grain they separated the pile sorting each kind to its parcel and when it was all done they vanished out of sight in moment venus at the approach of twilight returned from the banquet of the gods breathing odors and crowned with roses seeing the task done she exclaimed this is work of yours wicked one but his whom to your own and his misfortune you have enticed so saying she threw her piece of black bread her supper and went away next morning venus ordered psyche to be called and said to her behold yonder grove which stretches along the margin of the water there you will ﬁnd sheep feeding without shepherd with ﬂeeces on their backs go fetch sample of that precious wool gathered from every one of their ﬂeeces psyche obediently went to the riverside

woolly gold sticking to the bushes and the trunks of the trees thus the compassionate river god gave psyche instructions how to accomplish her task and by observing his directions she soon returned to

her how by certain cave she might reach the realms of pluto and how to avoid all the dangers of the road to pass by cerberus the dog and prevail on charon the ferryman to take her across the black

the box nor allow your curiosity to pry into the treasure of the beauty of the goddesses psyche encouraged by this advice obeyed it in all things and taking heed to her ways travelled safely to the kingdom of pluto she was admitted to the palace of proserpine and without accepting the delicate seat or delicious banquet that was offered her but contented with coarse bread her food she delivered her message from venus presently the box was returned to her shut and ﬁlled with the precious commodity then she returned the way she came and glad was she to come out once more into the light of day

not able longer to bear the absence of his beloved psyche slipping through the smallest crack of the window of his chamber which happened to be left open ﬂew to the spot where psyche lay and gathering

and scylla was his daughter the siege had now lasted six months and the city still held out it was decreed by fate that it should not be taken so long certain purple lock which glittered among the hair of king nisus remained on his head there was tower on the city walls which overlooked the plain where minos and his army were encamped to this tower scylla used to repair and look abroad over the tents of the hostile army the siege had lasted so long that she had learned to distinguish the persons of the leaders minos in particular excited her admiration arrayed in his helmet and bearing his shield she admired his graceful deportment if he threw his javelin skill seemed combined with force in the dischar ge if he drew his bow apollo himself could not have done it more gracefully but when he laid aside his helmet and in his purple robes bestrode his white horse with its gay caparisons and reined in its foaming mouth the daughter of nisus was hardly mistress of herself she was almost frantic with admiration she envied the weapon that he grasped the reins that he held she felt if she could if it were possible go to him through the hostile ranks she felt an impulse to cast herself down from the tower into the midst of his camp or to open the gates to him or to anything else so only it might gratify minos she sat in the tower she talked thus with herself i know not whether to rejoice or grieve at this sad war i grieve that minos is our enemy but i rejoice at any cause that brings him to my sight perhaps he would be willing to grant us peace and receive hostage i would ﬂy down if i could and alight in his camp and tell him that we yield ourselves to his mercy but then to betray my father rather would i never see minos again and yet doubt it is sometimes the best thing city to be conquered when the conqueror is clement and generous minos certainly has right on his side i think we shall be conquered and if that must be the end of it why should not love unbar the gates to him instead of leaving it to be done by war better spare delay and slaughter if we can and if any one should wound or kill minos one surely would have the heart to it yet ignorantly not knowing him one might i will i will surrender myself to him with my country dowry and so put an end to the war but how the gates are guarded and my father keeps the keys he only stands in my way that

stood in the way of her love and can any other woman dare more than i i would encounter ﬁre and sword to gain my object but here there is need of ﬁre and sword i only need my father purple lock more precious than gold to that will give all i wish while she thus reasoned night came on and soon the whole palace was buried in sleep she entered her father bedchamber and cut off the fatal lock then passed out of the city and entered the enemy camp she demanded to be led to the king and thus addressed him i am scylla the daughter of nisus i surrender to you my country and my father house i ask reward but yourself love of you i have done it see here the purple lock with this i give you my father and his kingdom she held out her hand with the fatal spoil minos shrunk back and refused to touch it the gods destr oy thee infamous woman he exclaimed disgrace of our time may neither earth nor sea yield thee surely my crete where jove himself was cradled shall not be polluted with such monster

kiss he plunged his arms in to embrace the beloved object it ﬂed at the touch but returned again after moment and renewed the fascination he could not tear himself away he lost all thought of food or

defensive war only that she patronized and she had sympathy with mars savage love of violence and bloodshed athens was her chosen seat her own city awarded to her the prize of contest with neptune who also aspired to it the tale ran that in the reign of cecrops the ﬁrst king of athens the two deities contended the possession of the city the gods decreed that it should be awarded to that one who produced the gift most useful to mortals neptune gave the horse minerva produced the olive the gods gave judgment that the olive was the more useful of the two and awarded the city to the goddess and it was named after her athens her name in greek being athene there was another contest in which mortal dared to come in competition with minerva that mortal was arachne maiden who had attained such skill in the arts of weaving and embroidery that the nymphs themselves would leave their groves and fountain s to come and gaze upon her work it was not only beautiful when it was done but beautiful also in the doing to watch her she took the wool in its rude state and formed it into rolls or separated it with her ﬁngers and carded it till it looked light and soft cloud or twirled the spindle with skilful touch or wove the web or after it was woven adorned it with her needle one would have said that minerva herself had taught her but this she denied and could not bear to be thought pupil even of goddess let minerva try her skill with mine said she if beaten i will pay the penalty minerva heard this and was displeased she assumed the form of an old woman and went and gave arachne some friendly advice i have had much experience said she and i hope you will not despise my counsel challenge your you will but not compete with goddess on the contrary i advise you to ask her forgiveness what you have said and she is merciful perhaps she will pardon you arachne stopped her spinning and looked at the old dame with anger in her countenance keep your counsel said she your daughters or handmaids my part i know what i say and i stand to it i am not afraid of the goddess let her try her skill if she dare venture she comes said minerva the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https dropping her disguise stood confe ssed the nymphs bent low in homage and all the bystanders paid reverence arachne alone was unterriﬁed she blushed indeed sudden color dyed her cheek and then she grew pale but she stood to her resolve and with foolish conceit of her own skill rushed on her fate minerva forbore longer nor interposed any further advice they proceed to the

the earth from which horse has leaped forth minerva depicted herself with helmed head her aegis covering her breast such was the central circle and in the four corners were represented incidents illustrating the displeasure of the gods at such presumptuous mortals had dared to contend with them these were meant warnings to her rival to give up the contest before it was too late arachne ﬁlled her web with subjects designedly chosen to exhibit the failings and errors of the gods one scene represented leda caressing the swan under which form jupiter had disguised himself and another danae in

at the sight of the heaving waves and to draw back her feet from the water arachne ﬁlled her canvas with similar subjects wonderfully well done but strongly marking her presumption and impiety minerva could not forbear to admire yet felt indignant at the insult she struck the web with her shuttle and rent it in pieces she then touched the forehead of arachne and made her feel her guilt and shame she could not endure it and went and hanged herself minerva pitied her she saw her suspended by rope live she said guilty woman and that you may preserve the memory of this lesson continue to hang

differed from men chieﬂy in their size and in this particular we must recognize wide distinction among them the human giants if so they may be called such the cyclopes antaeus orion and others must be

with pity yet not daring entirely to disobey tied up the child by the feet and left him hanging to the branch of tree in this condition the infant was found by peasant who carried him to his master

arts of juno rendered subject to eurystheus and compelled to perform all his commands eurystheus enjoined upon him succession of desperate adventures which are called the twelve labors of hercules the ﬁrst was the the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https the nemean lion the valley of nemea was infested by terrible lion eurystheus ordered hercules to bring him the skin of this monster after using in vain his club and arrows against the lion hercules strangled the animal with his hands he returned carrying the dead lion on his shoulders but eurystheus was so frightened at the sight of it and at this proof of the prodigious strength of the hero that he ordered him to deliver the account of his exploits in future outside the town his next labor was the slaughter of the hydra this monster ravaged the country of argos and dwelt in swamp near the well of amymone this well had been discovered by amymone when the country was suffering from drought and the story was that neptune who loved her had permitted her to touch the rock with his trident and spring of three outlets burst forth here the hydra took up his position and hercules was sent to destroy him the hydra had nine heads of which the middle one was immortal hercules struck off its heads with his club but in the place of the head knocked off two new ones grew forth each time at length with the assistance of his faithful servant iolaus he burned away the heads of the hydra and buried the ninth or immortal one under huge rock another labor was the cleaning of the augean stables augeas king of elis had herd of three thousand oxen whose stalls had not been cleansed thirty years hercules brought the rivers alpheus and peneus through them and cleansed them thoroughly in one day his next labor was of more delicate kind admeta the daughter of eurystheus longed to obtain the girdle of the queen of the amazons and eurystheus ordered hercules to go and get it the amazons were nation of women they were very warlike and held several ﬂourishing cities it was their custom to bring up only the female children the boys were either sent away to the neighboring nations or put to death hercules was accompanied by number of volunteers and after various adventures at last reached the country of the amazons hippolyta the queen received him kindly and consented to yield him her girdle but juno taking the form of an amazon went and persuaded the rest that the strangers were carrying off their queen they instantly armed and came in great numbers down to the ship hercules thinking that hippolyta had acted treacherously slew her and taking her girdle made sail homewards another task enjoined him was to bring to eurystheus the oxen of geryon monster with three bodies who dwelt in the island erytheia the red so called because it lay at the west under the rays of the setting sun this description is thought to apply to spain of which geryon was king after traversing various countries hercules reached at length the frontiers of libya and europe where he raised the two mountains of calpe and abyla monuments of his progress or according to another account rent one mountain into two and left half on each side forming the straits of gibraltar the two mountains being called the pillars of hercules the oxen were guarded by the giant eurytion and his dog but hercules killed the giant and his dog and brought away the oxen in safety to eurystheus the most difﬁcult labor of all was getting the golden apples of the hesperides hercules did not know where to ﬁnd them these were the apples which juno had received at her wedding from the goddess of the earth and which she had intrusted to the keeping of the daughters of hesperus assisted by watchful dragon

supposed by some to be the oranges of spain of which the greeks had heard some obscure accounts celebrated exploit of hercules was his victory over antaeus antaeus the son of terra the earth was mighty giant and wrestler whose strength was invincible so long he remained in contact with his mother earth he compelled all strangers who came to his country to wrestle with him on condition that if conquered they all were they should be put to death hercules encountered him and ﬁnding that it was of avail to throw him he always rose with renewed strength from every fall he lifted him up from the earth and strangled him in the air cacus was huge giant who inhabited cave on mount aventine and plundered the surrounding country when hercules was driving home the oxen of geryon cacus stole part of the cattle while the hero slept that their footprints might not serve to show where they had been driven he dragged them backward by their tails to his cave so their tracks all seemed to show that they had gone in the opposit direction hercules was deceived by this stratagem and would have failed to ﬁnd his oxen if it had not happened that in driving the remainder of the herd past the cave where the stolen ones were concealed those within began to low and were thus discovered cacus was slain by hercules the last exploit we shall record was bringing cerberus from the lower world hercules descended into hades accompanied by mercury and minerva he obtained permission from pluto to carry cerberus to the upper air provided he could it without the use of weapons and in spite of the monster struggling he seized him held him fast and carried him to eurystheus and afterwards brought him back again when he was in hades he obtained the liberty of theseus his admirer and imitator who had been

horn from my head the naiades took it consecrated it and ﬁlled it with fragrant ﬂowers plenty adopted my horn and made it her own and called it the ancients were fond of ﬁnding hidden meaning in their mythological tales they explain this ﬁght of achelous with hercules by saying achelous was river that in seasons of rain overﬂowed its banks when the fable says that achelous loved dejanira and sought union with her the meaning is that the river in its windings ﬂowed through part of dejanira kingdom it was said to take the form of snake because of its winding and of bull because it made brawling or roaring in its course when the river swelled it made itself another channel thus its head was horned hercules prevented the return of these periodical overﬂows by embankments and canals and therefore

their occupation one of them put her head above the water and seeing him returned and gave information to his mother who ordered that he should be brought into her presence the river at her command opened itself and let him pass in while it stood curled like mountain on either side he descended to the region where the fountains of the great rivers lie he saw the enormous receptacles of waters

was despatched to heal hector bruises and to inspirit his heart these orders were obeyed with such speed that while the battle still raged hector returned to the ﬁeld and neptune betook himself to his own dominions an arrow from paris bow wounded machaon son of aesculapius who inherited his father art of healing and was therefore of great value to the greeks their surgeon besides being one of their bravest warriors nestor took machaon in his chariot and conveyed him from the ﬁeld they passed the ships of achilles that hero looking out over the ﬁeld saw the chariot of nestor and recognized the old chief but could not discern who the wounded chief was so calling patroclus his companion and dearest friend he sent him to nestor tent to inquire patroclus arriving at nestor tent saw machaon wounded and having told the cause of his coming would have hastened away but nestor detained him to tell him the extent of the grecian calamities he reminded him also how at the time of departing troy achilles and himself had been charged by their respective fathers with different advice achilles to aspire to the highest pitch of glory patroclus the elder to keep watch over his frien d and to guide his inexperience now said nestor is the time such inﬂuence if the gods so please thou mayest win him back to the common cause but if not let him at least send his soldiers to the ﬁeld and come thou patroclus clad in his armor and perhaps the very sight of it may drive back the trojans patroclus was strongly moved with this address and hastened back to achilles revolving in his mind all he had seen and heard he told the prince the sad condition of affairs at the camp of their late associates diomede ulyss es agamemnon machaon all wounded the rampart broken down the enemy among the ships preparing to burn them and thus to cut off all means of return to greece while they spoke the ﬂames burst forth from one of the ships achilles at the sight relented so far to grant patroclus his request to lead the myrmidons so were achilles soldiers called to the ﬁeld and to lend him his armor that he might thereby strike more terror into the minds of the trojans without delay the soldiers were marshalled patroclus put on the radiant armor and mounted the chariot of achilles and led forth the the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https battle but before he went achilles strictly charged him that he should be content with repelling the foe seek not said he to press the trojans without lest thou add still more to the disgrace already mine then exhorting the troops to their best he dismissed them full of ardor to the ﬁght patroclus and his myrmidons at once plunged into the contest where it raged hottest at the sight of which the joyful grecians shouted and the ships reechoed the acclaim the trojans at the sight of the armor struck with terror looked everywhere refuge first those who had got possession of the ship and set it on ﬁre left and allowed the grecians to retake it and extinguish the ﬂames then the rest of the trojans ﬂed in dismay ajax menelaus and the two sons of nestor performed prodigies of valor hector was forced to turn his horses heads and retire from the enclosure leaving his men entangled in the to escape they could patroclus drove them before him slaying many none daring to make stand against him at last sarpedon son of jove ventured to oppose himself in ﬁght to patroclus jupiter looked down upon him and would have snatched him from the fate which awaited him but juno hinted that if he did so it would induce all others of the inhabitants of heaven to interpose in like manner whenever any of their offspring were endangered to which reason jove yielded sarpedon threw his spear but missed patroclus but patroclus threw his with better success it pierced sarpedon breast and he fell and calling to his friends to save his body from the foe expired then furious contest arose the possession of the corpse the greeks succeeded and stripped sarpedon of his armor but jove would not allow the remains of his son to be dishonored and by his command apoll snatched from the midst of the combatants the body of sarpedon and committed it to the care of the twin brothers death and sleep by whom it was transported to l ycia the native land of sarpedon where it received due funeral rites thus far patroclus had succeeded to his utmost wish in repelling the trojans and relieving his countrymen but now came change of fortune hector borne in his chariot confronted him patroclus threw vast stone at hector which missed its aim but smote cebriones the charioteer and knocked him from the car hector leaped from the chariot to rescue his friend and patroclus also descended to complete his victory thus the two heroes met face to face at this decisive moment the poet if reluctant to give hector the glory records that phoebus took part against patroclus he struck the helmet from his head and the lance from his hand at the same moment an obscure trojan wounded him in the back and hector pressing forward pierced him with his spear he fell mortally wounded then arose tremendous conﬂict the body of patroclus but his armor was at once taken possession of by hector who retiring short distance divested himself of his own armor and put on that of achilles then returned to the ﬁght ajax and menelaus defended the body and hector and his bravest warriors struggled to capture it the battle raged with equal fortunes when jove enveloped the whole face of heaven with dark cloud the lightning ﬂashed the thunder roared and ajax looking round some one whom he might despatch to achilles to tell him of the death of his friend and of the imminent danger that his remains would fall into the hands of the enemy could see suitable messenger it was then that he exclaimed in those famous lines so often quoted father of heaven and earth deliver thou achaia host from darkness clear the skies the project

my humble prayer dispel this cloud the light of heaven restore give to see and ajax asks more if greece must perish we thy will obey but let us perish in the face of day jupiter heard the prayer and dispersed the clouds then ajax sent antilochus to achilles with the intelligence of patroclus death and of the conﬂict raging his remains the greeks at last succeeded in bearing off the body to the ships closely pursued by hector and aeneas and the rest of the trojans achilles heard the fate of his friend with such distress that antilochus feared while that he would destroy himself his groans reached the ears of his mother thetis far down in the deeps of ocean where she abode and she hastened to him to inquire the cause she found him overwhelmed with that he had indulged his resentment so far and suffered his friend to fall victim to it but his only consolation was the hope of revenge he would ﬂy instantly in search of hector but his mother reminded him that he was now without armor and promised him if he would but wait till the morrow she would procure him suit of armor from vulcan more than equal to that he had lost he consented and thetis immediately repaired to vulcan palace she found him busy at his forge making tripods his own use so artfully constructed that they moved forward of their own accord when wanted and retired again when dismissed on hearing the request of thetis vulcan immediately laid aside his work and hastened to comply with her wishes he fabricated splendid suit of armor achilles ﬁrst shield adorned with elaborate devices then helmet crested with gold then corselet and greaves of impenetrable temper all perfectly adapted to his form and of consummate workmanship it was all done in one night and thetis receiving it descended with it to earth and laid it down at achilles feet at the dawn of day the ﬁrst glow of pleasure that achilles had felt since the death of patroclus was at the sight of this splendid armor and now arrayed in it he went forth into the camp calling all the chiefs to council when they were all assembled he addressed them renouncing his displeasure against agamemnon and bitterly lamenting the miseries that had resulted from it he called on them to proceed at once to the ﬁeld agamemnon made suitable reply laying all the blame on ate the goddess of discord and thereupon complete reconcilement took place between the heroes then achilles went forth to battle inspired with rage and thirst vengeance that made him irresistible the bravest warriors ﬂed before him or fell by his lance hector cautioned by apollo kept aloof but the god assuming the form of one of priam sons lycaon urged aeneas to encounter the terrible warri or aeneas though he felt himself unequal did the project gutenberg ebook of the age of

seized stone such two men of modern times could hardly lift and was about to throw it and achilles with sword drawn was about to rush upon him when neptune who looked out upon the contest moved with pity aeneas who he saw would surely fall victim if not speedily rescued spread cloud between the combatants and lifting aeneas from the ground bore him over the heads of warriors and steeds to the rear of the battle achilles when the mist cleared away looked round in vain his adversary and acknowledging the prodigy turned his arms against other champions but none dared stand before him and priam looking down from the city walls beheld his whole army in full ﬂight towards the city he gave command to open wide the gates to receive the fugitives and to shut them soon the trojans should have passed lest the enemy should enter likewise but achilles was so close in pursuit that that would have been impossible if apollo had not in the form of agenor priam son encountered achilles while then turned to ﬂy and taken the way apart from the city achilles pursued and had chased his supposed victim far from the walls when apollo disclosed himself and achilles perceiving how he had been deluded gave up the chase but when the rest had escaped into the town hector stood without determined to await the combat his old father called to him from the walls and begged him to retire nor tempt the encounter his mother hecuba also besought him to the same effect but all in vain how can i said he to himself by whose command the people went to this day contest where so many have fallen seek

not let him sink in weariness then pallas assuming the form of deiph obus hector bravest brother appeared suddenly at his side hector saw him with delight and thus strengthened stopped his ﬂight and turned to meet achilles hector threw his spear which struck the shield of achilles and bounded back he turned to receive another from the hand of deiphobus but deiphobus was gone then hector understood his doom and said alas it is plain this is my hour to die i thought deiphobus at hand but pallas deceived and he is still in troy but i will not fall inglorious so saying he drew his falchion from his side and rushed at once to combat achilles secured behind his shield waited the approach of hector when he came within reach of his spear achilles choosing with his eye vulnerable part where the armor leaves the neck uncovered aimed his spear at that part and hector fell and feebly said spare my body let my parents ransom it and let receive funeral rites from the sons and daughters of troy to which achilles replied dog name not ransom nor pity to on whom you have brought such dire distress trust naugh t shall save thy carcass from the dogs though twenty ransoms and thy weight in gold were offered i would refuse it all the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https saying he stripped the body of its armor and fastening cords to the feet tied

and archery then the chiefs sat down to the funeral banquet and after that retired to rest but achilles neither partook of the feast nor of sleep the recollection of his lost friend kept him awake remembering their companionship in toil and dangers in battle or on the perilous deep before the earliest dawn he left his tent and joining to his chariot his swift steeds he fastened hector body to be dragged behind twice he dragged him around the tomb of patroclus leaving him at length stretched in the dust but apollo would not permit the body to be torn or disﬁgured with all this abuse but preserved it free from all taint or deﬁlement while achilles indulged his wrath in thus disgracing brave hector jupiter in pity summoned thetis to his presence he told her to go to her son and prevail on him to restore the body of hector to his friends then jupiter sent iris to king priam to encourage him to go to achilles and beg the body of his son iris delivered her message and priam immediately prepared to obey he opened his treasuries and took out rich garments and cloths with ten talents in gold and two splendid tripods and golden cup of matchless workmanship then he called to his sons and bade them draw forth his litter and place in it the various articles designed ransom to achilles when all was ready the old king with single companion aged himself the herald idaeus drove forth from

terrible hands which had destroyed so many of his sons think achilles he said of thy own father full of days like and trembling on the gloomy verge of life perhaps even now some neighbor chief

were and where from ulysses replied most humbly stating that they were greeks from the great expedition that had lately won so much glory in the conquest of troy that they were now on their way home

their brains he proceeded to devour them with great relish and having made hearty meal stretched himself out on the ﬂoor to sleep ulysses was tempted to seize the opportunity and plunge his sword into him he slept but recollected that it would only expose them all to certain destruction the rock with which the giant had closed up the door was far beyond their power to remove and they would therefore be in hopeless imprisonment next morning the giant seized two more of the greeks and despatched them in the same manner their companions feasting on their ﬂesh till fragment was left he then moved away the rock from the door drove out his ﬂocks and went out carefully replacing the barrier after him when he was gone ulysses planned how he might take vengeance his murdered friends and effect his escape with his surviving companions he made his men prepare massive bar of wood cut by the cyclops staff which they found in the cave they sharpened the end of it and seasoned it in the ﬁre and hid it under the straw on the cavern ﬂoor then four of the boldest were selected with whom ulysses joined himself ﬁfth the cyclops came home at evening rolled away the stone and drove in his ﬂock usual after milking them and making his arrangements before he seized two more of ulysses companions and dashed their brains out and made his evening meal upon them he had on the others after he had supped ulysses approaching him handed him bowl of wine saying cyclops this is wine taste and drink after thy meal of men ﬂesh he took and drank it and was hugely delighted with it and called more

stake into the ﬁre till it was all one burning coal then poising it exactly above the giant only eye they buried it deeply into the socket twirling it round carpenter does his auger the howling monster with his outcry ﬁlled the cavern and ulysses with his aids nimbly got out of his way and concealed themselves in the cave he bellowing called aloud on all the cyclopes dwelling in the caves around him far and near they on his cry ﬂocked round the den and inquired what grievous hurt had caused him to sound such an alarm and break their slumbers he replied friends i die and noman gives the blow they answered if man hurts thee it is the stroke of jove and thou must bear it so saying they left him groaning next morning the cyclops rolled away the stone to let his ﬂock out to pasture but planted himself in the door of the cave to feel of all they went out that ulysses and his men should not escape with them but ulysses had made his men harness the rams of the ﬂock three abreast with osiers which they found on the ﬂoor of the cave to the middle ram of the three one of the greeks suspended himself so protected by the exterior rams on either side they passed the giant felt of the animals backs and sides but never thought of their bellies so the men all passed safe ulysses himself being on the last one that passed when they had got few paces from the cavern ulysses and his friends released themselves from their rams and drove good part of the ﬂock down to the shore to their boat they put them aboard with all haste then pushed off from the shore and when at safe distance ulysses shouted out cyclops the gods have well requited thee thy atrocious deeds know it is ulysses to whom thou owest thy shameful loss of sight the cyclops hearing this seized rock that projected from the side of the mountain and rending it from its bed he lifted it high in the air then exerting all his force hurled it in the direction of the voice down came the mass just clearing the vessel

distance than before the giant answered them with curses but ulysses and his friends plied their oars vigorously and soon regained their companions ulysses next arrived at the island of aeolus to this monarch jupiter had intrusted the government of the winds to send them forth or retain them at his will he treated ulysses hospitably and at his departure gave him tied up in leathern bag with silver string such winds might be hurtful and dangerous commanding fair winds to blow the barks towards their country nine days they sped before the wind and all that time ulysses had stood at the helm without sleep at last quite exhausted he lay down to sleep while he slept the crew conferred together about the mysterious bag and concluded it must contain treasures given by the hospitable king

overturned them and with their spears despatched the seamen they struggled in the water all the vessels with their crews were destroyed except ulys ses own ship which had remained outside and ﬁnding safety but in ﬂight he exhorted his men to ply their oars vigorously and they escaped with grief their slain companions mixed with joy at their own escape they pursued their way till they arrived at the aeaean isle where circe dwelt the daughter of the sun landing here ulysses climbed hill and gazing round saw signs of habitation excep t in one spot at the centre of the island where he perceived palace embowered with trees he sent forward half of his crew under the command of eurylochus to see what prospect of hospitality they might ﬁnd they approached the palace they found themselves

from his attempt mercury provided him with sprig of the plant moly of wonderful power to resist sorceries and instructed him how to act ulysses proceeded and reaching the palace was courteously received by circe who entertained him she had done his companions and after he had eaten and drank touched him with her wand saying hence seek the sty and wallow with thy friends but he instead of obeying drew his sword and rushed upon her with fury in his countenance she fell on her knees and begged mercy he dictated solemn oath that she would release his companions and practise further harm

their departure and instructed them how to pass safely by the coast of the sirens the sirens were who had the power of charming by their song all who heard them so that the unhappy mariners were irresistibly impelled to cast themselves into the sea to their destruction circe directed ulysses to ﬁll the ears of his seamen with wax so that they should not hear the strain and to cause himself to be bound to the mast and his people to be strictly enjoined whatever he might say or by means to release him till they should have passed the sirens island ulysses obeyed these directions he ﬁlled the ears of his people with wax and suffered them to bind him with cords ﬁrmly to the mast they approached the sirens island the sea was calm and over the waters came the notes of music so ravishing and attractive that ulysses struggled to get loose and by cries and signs to his people begged to be released but they obedient to his previous orders sprang forward and bound him still faster they held

am your kinsman polydore here murdered with many arrows from which bush has grown nourished with my blood these words recalled to the recollection of aeneas that polydore was young prince of troy whom his father had sent with ample treasures to the neigh boring land of thrace to be there brought up at distance from the horrors of war the king to whom he was sent had murdered him and seized his treasures aeneas and his companions considering the land accursed by the stain of such crime hastened away they next landed on the island of delos which was once ﬂoating island till jupiter fastened it by adamantine chains to the bottom of the sea apollo and diana were born there and the island was sacred to apollo here aeneas consulted the oracle of apollo and received an answer ambiguous usual seek your ancient mother there the race of aeneas shall dwell and reduce all other nations to their sway the trojans heard with joy and immediately began to ask one another where is the spot intended

him the harpies darted down from the air and carried it off they were driven away from phineus by the heroes of the argonautic expedition and took refuge in the island where aeneas now found them when they entered the port the trojans saw herds of cattle roaming over the plain they slew many they wished and prepared feast but sooner had they seated themselves at the table than horrible clamor was heard in the air and ﬂock of these odious harpies came rushing down upon them seizing in their talons the meat from the dishes and ﬂying away with it aeneas and his companions drew their swords and dealt vigorous blows among the monsters but to purpose they were so nimble it was almost impossible to hit them and their feathers were like armor impenetrable to steel one of them perched on neighboring cliff screamed out is it thus trojans you treat us innocent birds ﬁrst slaughter our cattle and then make war on ourselves she then predicted dire sufferings to them in their future course

their caves and woods and lined the shore like row of lofty pine trees the trojans plied their oars and soon left them out of sight aeneas had been cautioned by helenus to avoid the strait guarded by the monsters scylla and charybdis there ulysses the reader will remember had lost six of his men seized by scylla while the navigators were wholly intent upon avoiding charybdis aeneas following the advice of helenus shunned the dangerous pass and coasted along the island of sicily juno seeing the trojans speeding their way prosperously towards their destine d shore felt her old grudge against

shaken with vapors and mysterious sounds issue from the bowels of the earth the lake avernus is supposed to ﬁll the crater of an extinct volcano it is circula r half mile wide and very deep surrounded by high banks which in virgil time were covered with gloomy forest mephitic vapors rise from its waters so that life is found on its banks and birds ﬂy over it here according to the poet was the cave

shaken and the howling of dogs announced the approach of the deities now said the sibyl summon up your courage you will need it she descended into the cave and aeneas followed before the threshold of

opposite shore but the sibyl rebuked him the wish thus to transgress the laws of pluto but consoled him by informing him that the people of the shore where his body had been wafted by the waves should be stirred up by prodigies to give it due burial and that the promontory should bear the name of cape palinurus which it does to this day leaving palinurus consoled by these words they approached the

along the banks of the stream wandered countless multitude numerous insects in the summer air aeneas with surprise inquired who were these anchises answered they are souls to which bodies are to be given in due time meanwhile they dwell on lethe bank and drink oblivion of their former lives father said aeneas is it possible that any can be so in love with life to wish to leave these tranquil seats the upper world anchises replied by explaining the plan of creation the creator he told him originally made the material of which souls are composed of the four elements ﬁre air earth and water all which when united took the form of the most excellent part ﬁre and became flame this material was scattered like seed among the heavenly bodies the sun moon and stars of this seed the inferior gods created man and all other animals mingling it with various proportions of earth by which its purity was alloyed and reduced thus the more earth predomin ates in the composition the less pure is the individual and we see men and women with their bodies have not the purity of childhood so in proportion to the time which the union of body and soul has lasted is the impurity contracted by the spiritual part this impurity must be purged away after death which is done by ventilating the souls in the current of winds or merging them in water or burning out their impurities by ﬁre some few of whom anchises intimates that he is one are admitted at once to elysium there to remain but the rest after the impurities of earth are purged away are sent back to life endowed with new bodies having

last he encountered aeneas and the armies stood still to see the issue mezentius threw his spear which striking aeneas shield glanced off and hit anthor he was grecian by birth who had left argos his

on and he was compelled to deal the fatal blow lausus fell and aeneas bent over him in pity hapless youth he said what can i you worthy of your praise keep those arms in which you glory and fear not but that your body shall be restored to your friends and have due funeral honors so saying he called the timid followers and delivered the body into their hands mezentius meanwhile had been borne to

aeneas stood fenced with his shield turning every way to meet them at last after mezentius had three times made the circuit aeneas threw his lance directly at the horse head it pierced his temples and he fell while shout from both armies rent the skies mezentius asked mercy but only that his body might be spared the insults of his revolted subjects and be buried in the same grave with his son he received the fatal stroke not unprepared and poured out his life and his blood together pallas camilla turnus while these things were doing in one part of the ﬁeld in another turnus encountered the youthful pallas the contest between champions so unequally matched could not be doubtful pallas bore himself bravely but fell by the lance of turnus the victor almost relented when he saw the brave youth lying dead at his feet and spared to use the privilege of conqueror in despoiling him of his arms the belt only adorned with studs and carvings of gold he took and clasped round his own body the rest he remitted to the friends of the slain after the battle there was cessation of arms some days to allow both armies to bury their dead in this interval aeneas challenged turnus to decide the contest by single combat but turnus evaded the challenge another battle ensued in which camilla the virgin warrior was chieﬂy conspicuous her deeds of valor surpassed those of the bravest warriors and many trojans and etruscans fell pierced with her darts or struck down by her at last an etruscan named aruns who had watched her long seeking some advantage observed her pursuing ﬂying enemy whose

attendant maidens but diana who beheld her fate suffered not her slaughter to be unavenged aruns he stole away glad but frightened was struck by secret arrow launched by one of the nymphs of diana train and died ignobly and unknown at length the ﬁnal conﬂict took place between aeneas and turnus turnus had avoided the contest long he could but at last impelled by the ill success of his arms and by the murmurs of his followers he braced himself to the conﬂict it could not be doubtful on the side of aeneas were the expressed decree of destiny the aid of his at every emer gency and impenetrable armor fabricated by vulcan at her request her son turnus on the other hand was deserted by his celestial allies juno having been expressly forbidden by jupiter to assist him any longer turnus threw his lance but it recoiled harmless from the shield of aeneas the trojan hero then threw his which penetrated the shield of turnus and pierced his thigh then turnus fortitude forso ok him and he begged mercy and aeneas would have given him his life but at the instant his eye fell on the belt of pallas which turnus had taken from the slaughtered youth instantly his rage revived and exclaiming pallas immolates thee with this blow he thrust him through with his sword here the poem of the aeneid closes and we are left to infer that aeneas having triumphed over his foes obtained lavinia his bride

xxxiv pythagoras the teachings of anchises to aeneas respecting the nature of the human soul were in conformity with the doctrines of the pythagoreans pythagoras born ﬁve hundred and forty years was native of the island of samos but passed the chief portion of his life at crotona in italy he is therefore sometimes called the samian and sometimes the philosopher of crotona when young he travelled extensively and it is said visited egypt where he was instructed by the priests in all their learning and afterwards journeyed to the east and visited the persian and chaldean magi and the brahmins of india at crotona where he ﬁnally established himself his extraordinary qualities collected round him great number of disciples the inhabitants were notorious luxury and licentiousness but the good effects of his inﬂuence were soon visible sobriety and temperance succeeded six hundred of the inhabitants became his disciples and enrolled themselves in society to aid each other in the pursuit of wisdom uniting their property in one common stock the beneﬁt of the whole they were required to practise the greatest purity and simplicity of manners the ﬁrst lesson they learned was silence time they were required to be only hearers he pythagoras said so ipse dixit was to be held by them sufﬁcient without any proof it was only the advanced pupils after years of patient submission who were allowed to ask questions and to state objections pythagoras considered numbers the essence and principle of all things and attributed to them real and distinct existence so that in his view they were the elements out of which the universe was constructed how he conceived this process has never been satisfactorily explained he traced the various forms and phenomena of the world to numbers their basis and essence the monad or unit he regarded the source of all numbers the number two was imperfect and the cause of increase and division three was called the number of the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https because it had beginning middle and end four representing the square is in the highest degree perfect and ten it contains the sum of the four prime numbers comprehends all musical and arithmetical proportions and denotes the system of the world the numbers proceed from the monad so he regarded the pure and simple essence of the deity the source of all the forms of nature gods demons and heroes are emanations of the supreme and there is fourth emanation the human soul this is immortal and when freed from the fetters of the body passes to the habitation of the dead where it remains till it returns to the world to dwell in some other human or animal body and at last when sufﬁciently puriﬁed it returns to the source from which it proceeded this doctrine of the transmigration of souls metempsychosis which was originally egyptian and connected with the doctrine of reward and punishment of human actions was the chief cause why the pythagoreans killed animals ovid represents pythagoras addressing his disciples in these words souls never die but always on quitting one abode pass to another i myself can remember that in the time of the trojan war i was euphorbus the son of panthus and fell by the spear of menelaus lately being in the temple of juno at argos i recognized my shield hung up there among the trophies all things change nothing perishes the soul passes hither and thither occupying now this body now that passing from the body of beast into that of man and thence to beast again wax is stamped with certain ﬁgures then melted then stamped anew with others yet is always the same wax so the soul being always the same yet wears at different times different forms therefore if the love of kindred is not extinct in your bosoms forbear i entreat you to violate the life of those who may haply be your own relatives shakspeare in the merchant of venice makes gratiano allude to the metempsychosis where he says to shylock thou almost waver in my faith to hold opinion with pythagoras that souls of animals infuse themselves into the trunks of men thy currish spirit governed wolf who hanged human slaughter infused his soul in thee thy desires are wolﬁsh bloody starved and ravenous the relation of the notes of the musica l scale to numbers whereby harmony results from vibrations in equal times and discord from the reverse led pythagoras to apply the word harmony to the visible creation meaning by it the just adaptation of parts to each other this is the idea which dryden expresses in the beginning of his song cecilia day from harmony from heavenly harmony this everlasting frame began from harmony to harmony through all the compass of the notes it ran the diapason closing full in man in the centre of the universe he taught there was central ﬁre the principle of life the central ﬁre was surrounded by the earth the moon the sun and the ﬁve planets the distances of the various heavenly bodies from one another were conceived to correspond to the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https of the musical scale the heavenly bodies with the gods who inhabited them were supposed to perform choral dance round the central ﬁre not without song it is this doctrine which shakspeare alludes to when he makes lorenzo teach astronomy to jessica in this fashion look jessica

silver chime move in melodious time and let the base of heaven deep or gan blow and with your ninefold harmony make up full concert with the angelic symphony pythagoras is said to have invented the

was erected on the spot the prophetic inﬂuence was at ﬁrst variously attributed to the goddess earth to neptune themis and others but it was at length assigned to apollo and to him alone priestess was appointed whose ofﬁce it was to inhale the hallowed air and who was named the pythia she was prepared this duty by previous ablution at the fountain of castalia and being crowned with laurel was

age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https of aesculapius there were numerous oracles of aesculapius but the most celebrated one was at epidaurus here the sick sought responses and the recovery of their health by sleeping in the temple it has been inferred from the accounts that have come down to us that the treatment of the sick resembled what is now called animal magnetism or mesmerism serpents sacred to aesculapius probably because of superstition that those animals have faculty of renewing their youth by change of skin the worship of aesculapius was introduced into rome in time of great sickness and an embassy sent to the temple of epidaurus to entreat the aid of the god aesculapius was propitious and on the return of the ship accompanied it in the form of serpent arriving in the river tiber the serpent glided from the vessel and took possession of an island in the river and temple was there erected to his honor oracle of apis at memphis the sacred bull apis gave answer to those who consulted him by the manner in which he received or rejected what was presented to him if the bull refused food from the hand of the inquirer it was considered an unfavorable sign and the contrary when he received it it has been question whether oracular responses ought to be ascribed to mere human contrivance or to the agency of evil spirits the latter opinion has been most general in past ages third theory has been advanced since the phenomena of mesmerism have attracted attention that something like the mesmeric trance was induced in the pythoness and the faculty of clairvoyance really called into action another question is to the time when the pagan oracles ceased to give responses ancient christian writers assert that they became silent at the birth of christ and were heard more after that date milton adopts this view in his hymn of the nativity and in lines of solemn and elevated beauty pictures the consternation of the heathen idols at the advent of the saviour the

of of gods and of mythology origins of mythology having reached the close of our series of stories of pagan mythology and inquiry suggests itself whence came these stories have they foundation in truth or are they simply dreams of the imagination philosophers have suggested various theories on the subject and the scriptural theory according to which all mythological legends are derived from the narratives of scripture though the real facts have been disguised and altered thus deucalion is only another name noah hercules samson arion jonah etc sir walter raleigh in his history of the world says jubal tubal and were mercury vulcan and the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https of pasturage smithing and music the dragon which kept the golden apples was the serpent that beguiled eve nimrod tower was the attempt of the giants against heaven there are doubtless many curious coincidences like these but the theory can not without extravagance be pushed so far to account any great proportion of the stories the historical theory according to which all the persons mentioned in mythology were once real human beings and the legends and fabulous traditions relating to them are merely the additions and embellishments of later times thus the story of aeolus the king and god of the winds is supposed to have risen from the fact that aeolus was the ruler of some islands in the tyrrhenian sea where he reigned just and pious king and taught the natives the use of sails ships and how to tell from the signs of the atmosphere the changes of the weather and the winds cadmus who the legend says sowed the earth with dragon teeth from which sprang crop of armed men was in fact an emigrant from phoenicia and brought with him into greece the knowledge of the letters of the alphabet which he taught to the natives from these rudiments of learning sprung civilization which the poets have always been prone to describe deterioration of man ﬁrst estate the golden age of innocence and simplicity the allegorical theory supposes that all the myths of the ancients were allegorical and symbolical and contained some moral religious or philosophical truth or histor ical fact under the form of an allegory but came in process of time to be understood literally thus saturn who devours his own children is the same power whom the greeks called cronos time which may truly be said to destroy whatever it has brought into existence the story of io is interpreted in similar manner io is the moon and argus the starry sky which it were keeps sleepless watch over her the fabulous wanderings of io represent the continual revolutions of the moon which also suggested to milton the same idea to behold the wandering moon riding near her highest noon like one that had been led astray in the heaven wide pathless way penseroso the physical theory according to which the elements of air ﬁre and water were originally the objects of religious adora tion and the principal deities were personiﬁcations of the powers of nature the transition was easy from personiﬁcation of the elements to the notion of supernatural beings presiding over and governing the different objects of nature the greeks whose imagination was lively peopled all nature with invisible beings and supposed that every object from the sun and sea to the smallest fountain and rivulet was under the care of some particular divinity wordsworth in his excursion has beautifully developed this view of grecian mythology in that fair clime the lonely herdsman stretched on the soft grass through half summer day w ith music lulled his indolent repose and in some ﬁt of weariness if he when his own breath was silent chanced to hear distant strain far sweeter

all the theories which have been mentioned are true to certain extent it would therefore be more correct to say that the mythology of nation has sprung from all these sources combined than from any one in particular we may add also that there are many myths which have arisen from the desire of man to account those natural phenomena which he can not understand and not few have had their rise from similar desire of giving reason the names of places and persons statues of the gods to adequately represent to the eye the ideas intended to be conveyed to the mind under the several names of deities

others still extant and the acknowledged masterpieces of the sculptor the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https olympian jupiter the statue of the olympian jupiter by phidias was considered the highest achievement of this department of grecian art it was of colossal dimensions and was what the ancients called chryselephantine that is composed of ivory and gold the parts representing ﬂesh being of ivory laid on core of wood or stone while the drapery and other ornaments were of gold the height of the ﬁgure was forty feet on pedestal twelve feet high the god was represented seated on his throne his brows were crowned with wreath of olive and he held in his right hand sceptre and in his left statue of victory the throne was of cedar adorned with gold and precious stones the idea which the artist essayed to embody was that of the supreme deity of the hellenic grecian nation enthroned conqu eror in perfect majesty and repose and ruling with nod the subject world phidias avowed that he took his idea from the representation which homer gives in the ﬁrst book of the iliad in the passage thus translated by pope he spoke and awful bends his sable

ivory and gold the eyes were of marble and probably painted to represent the iris and pupil the parthenon in which this statue stood was also constructed under the direction and superintendence of

its having been in the possession of the princes of that name in rome when it ﬁrst attracted attention about two hundred years ago an inscription on the base records it to be the work of cleomenes an athenian sculptor of 200 but the authenticity of the inscription is doubtful there is story that the artist was employed by public authority to make statue exhibiting the perfection of female beauty and to aid him in his task the most perfect forms the city could supply were furnished him models it is this which thomson alludes to in his summer so stands the statue that enchants the world so

from whose poems of the iliad and odyssey we have taken the chief part of our chapters of the trojan war and the return of the grecians is almost mythical personage the heroes he celebrates the

wealthy towns contend homer dead through which the living homer begged his bread these seven were smyrna scio rhodes colophon salamis argos and athens modern scholars have doubted whether the homeric poems are the work of any single mind this arises from the difﬁculty of believing that poems of such length could have been committed to writing at so early an age that usually assigned to these an age earlier than the date of any remaining inscriptions or coins and when materials capable of containing such long productions were yet introduced into use on the other hand it is asked how poems of such length could have been handed down from age to age by means of the memory alone this is answered by the statement that there was professional body of men called rhapsodists who recited the poems of others and whose business it was to commit to memory and rehearse pay the national and patriotic legends the prevailing opinion of the learned at this time seems to be that the framework and much of the structure of the poems belong to homer but that there are numerous interpolations and additions by other hands the date assigned to homer on the authority of herodotus is 850 virgil virgil called also by his surname maro from whose poem of the aeneid we have taken the story of aeneas was one of the great poets who made the reign of the roman emperor augustus so celebrated under the name of the augustan age virgil was born in mantua in the year 70 his great poem is ranked next to those of homer in the highest class of poetical composition the epic virgil is far inferior to homer in originality and invention but superior to him in correctness and elegance to critics of english lineage milton alone of modern poets seems worthy to be classed with these illustrious ancients his poem of paradise lost from which we have borrowed so many illustrations is in many respects equal in some superior the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https of the great works

held some ofﬁces of considerable dignity but poetry was his delight and he early resolved to devote himself to it he accordingly sought the society of the contemporary poets and was acquainted with horace and saw virgil though the latter died when ovid was yet too young and undistinguished to have formed his acquaintance ovid spent an easy life at rome in the enjoyment of competent income he was intimate with the family of augustus the emperor and it is supposed that some serious offence given to some member of that family was the cause of an event which reversed the poet happy circumstances and clouded all the latter portion of his life at the age of ﬁfty he was banished from rome and ordered to betake himself to tomi on the borders of the black sea here among the barbarous people and in severe climate the poet who had been accustomed to all the pleasures of luxurious capital and the society of his most distinguished contemporaries spent the last ten years of his life worn out with grief and anxiety his only consolation in exile was to address his wife and absent friends and his letters were all poetical though these poems the trista and letters from pontus have other topic than

builds itself nest in the branches of an oak or on the top of palm tree in this it collects cinnamon and spikenar d and myrrh and of these materials builds pile on which it deposits itself and dying breathes out its last breath amidst odors from the body of the parent bird young phoenix issues forth destined to live long life its predecessor when this has grown up and gained sufﬁcient strength it lifts its nest from the tree its own cradle and its parent sepulchre and carries it to the city of heliopolis in egypt and deposits it in the temple of the sun such is the account given by poet now let us see that of philosophic historian tacitus says in the consulship of paulus fabius 34 the miraculous bird known to the world by the name of the phoenix after disappearing series of ages revisited egypt it was attended in its ﬂight by group of various birds all attracted by the novelty and gazing with wonder at so beautiful an he then gives an account of the bird not varying materially from the preceding but adding some details the ﬁrst care of the young bird soon ﬂedged and able to trust to his wings is to perform the obsequies of his father but this duty is not undertaken rashly he collects quantity of myrrh and to try his strength makes frequent excursions with load on his back when he has gained sufﬁcient conﬁdence in his own vigor he takes up the body of his father and ﬂies with it to the altar of the sun where he leaves it to be consumed in ﬂames of fragrance other writers add few particulars the myrrh is compacted in the form of an egg in which the dead phoenix is enclosed from the mouldering ﬂesh of the dead bird worm springs and this worm when grown large is transformed into bird herodotus describes the bird though he says i have not seen it myself except in picture part of his plumage is and part crimson and he is the most part very much like an eagle in outline and bulk the ﬁrst writer who disclaimed belief in the existence of the phoenix was sir thomas browne in his vulgar errors published in he was replied to few years later by alexander ross who says in answer to the objection of the phoenix so seldom making his appearance his instinct teaches him to keep out of the way of the tyrant of the creation man if he were to be got at some wealthy glutton would surely devour him though there were more in the world dryden in one

to attack this terrible and unapproachable monster there is an old saying that everything has its enemy the cockatrice quailed before the weasel the basilisk might look daggers the weasel cared not but advanced boldly to the conﬂict when bitten the weasel retired moment to eat some rue which was the only plant the basilisks could not wither returned with renewed strength and soundness to the charge and never left the enemy till he was stretched dead on the plain the monster too if conscious of the irregular way in which he came into the world was supposed to have great antipathy to cock and well he might soon he heard the cock crow he expired the basilisk was of some use after death thus we read that its carcass was suspended in the temple of apollo and in private houses sovereign

the will of the animal kind of small sword in short with which hunter who was not exceedingly cunning in fence could have chance others maintained that all the animal strength lay in its horn and that when hard pressed in pursuit it would throw itself from the pinnacle of the highest rocks horn foremost so to pitch upon it and then quietly march of f not whit the worse its fall but it seems they found out how to circumvent the poor unicorn at last they discovered that it was great lover of purity and innocence so they took the ﬁeld with young virgin who was placed in the unsuspecting admirer way when the unicorn spied her he approached with all reverence couched beside her and laying his head in her lap fell asleep the treacherous virgin then gave signal and the hunters made in and captured the simple beast modern zoologists disgusted they well may be with such fables these disbelieve generally the existence of the unicorn yet there are animals bearing on their heads bony protuberance more or less like horn which may have given rise to the story the rhinoceros horn it is called is such protuberance though it does not exceed few inches in height and is far from agreeing with the descriptions of the horn of the unicorn the nearest approach to horn in the middle of the forehead is exhibited in the bony protuberance on the forehead of the giraffe but this also is short and blunt and is not the only horn of the anim al but third horn standing in front of the two others in ﬁne though it would be presumptuous to deny the existence of quadruped other than the rhinoceros

that you may recollect that the little creature you see in the ﬁre is salamander such one never was beheld before to my knowledge so saying he embraced and gave some money it seems unreasonable to doubt story of which signor cellini was both an eye and ear witness add to which the authority of numerous sage philosophers at the head of whom are aristotle and pliny afﬁrms this power of the salamander according to them the animal not only resists ﬁre but extinguishes it and when he sees the ﬂame charges it an enemy which he well knows how to the project gutenberg ebook of the age of

cloths were actually produced said to be made of salamander wool though the knowing ones detected that the substance of which they were composed was asbestos mineral which is in ﬁne ﬁlaments capable

irritated is produced in considerable quantity and would doubtless few moments defend the body from ﬁre then it is hibernating animal and in winter retires to some hollow tree or other cavity where it

the tops of mountains they adored ﬁre light and the sun emblem s of ormuzd the source of all light and purity but did not regard them independent deities the religious rites and ceremonies were regulated by the priests who were called magi the learning of the magi was connected with astrology and enchantment in which they were so celebrated that their name was applied to all orders of

the religion of the hindus is professedly founded on the vedas to these books of their scripture they attach the greatest sanctity and state that brahma himself composed them at the creation but the present arrangement of the vedas is attributed to the sage vyasa about ﬁve thousand years ago the vedas undoubtedly teach the belief of one supreme god the name of this deity is brahma his attributes are represented by the three personiﬁed powers of creation preservation and destruction which under the respective names of brahma vishnu and siva form the trimurti or triad of principal hindu gods of the inferior gods the most important are indra the god of heaven of thunder lightning storm and rain agni the god of ﬁre yama the god of the infernal regions surya the god of the sun brahma is the

ordinances of the vedas by which means they lost their strength and supremacy kalki is the name of the tenth avatar in which vishnu will appear at the end of the present age of the world to destroy all vice and wickedness and to restore mankind to virtue and purity siva siva is the third person of the hindu triad he is the personiﬁcation of the destroying principle though the third name he is in respect to the number of his worshippers and the extension of his worship before either of the others in the puranas the scriptures of the modern hindu religion allusion is made to the original power of this god destroyer that power not being to be called into exercise till after the expiration of twelve millions of years or when the universe will come to an end and mahadeva another name siva is rather the representative of regeneration than of destruction the worshippers of vishnu and siva form two sects each of which proclaims the superiority of its favorite deity denying the claims of the other and brahma the creator having ﬁnished his work seems to be regarded longer active and has now only one temple in india while mahadeva and vishnu have many the worshippers of vishnu are generally

been founded upon conquest the ﬁrst three castes being composed of foreign race who subdued the natives of the country and reduced them to an inferior caste others trace it to the fondness of perpetuating by descent from father to son certain ofﬁces or occupations the hindu tradition gives the following account of the origin of the various castes at the creation brahma resolved to give the earth inhabitants who should be direct emanations from his own body accordingly from his mouth came forth the eldest born brahma the priest to whom he conﬁded the four vedas from his right arm issued shatriya the warrior and from his left the warrior wife his thighs produced vaissyas male and female agriculturists and traders and lastly from his feet sprang sudras mechanics and laborers the four sons of brahma so signiﬁcantly brought into the world became the fathers of the human race and heads of their respective castes they were commanded to regard the four vedas containing all the rules of their faith and all that was necessary to guide them in their religious ceremonies they were also commanded to take rank in the order of their birth the brahmans uppermost having sprung from the head of brahma strong line of demarcation is drawn between the ﬁrst three castes and the sudras the former are allowed to receive instruction from the vedas which is not permitted to the sudras the brahmans possess the privilege of teaching the vedas and were in former times in exclusive possession of all knowledge though the sovereign of the country was chosen from the shatriya class also called rajputs the brahmans possessed the real power and were the royal counsellors the judges and magistrates of the country their persons and property were inviolable and though they committed the

arrives at years of maturity it becomes his duty to marry he ought to be supported by the contributions of the rich and not to be obliged to gain his subsistence by any laborious or productive occupation but all the brahmans could not be maintained by the working classes of the community it was found necessary to allow them to engage in productive employments we need say little of the two intermedia classes whose rank and privileges may be readily inferred from their occupations the sudras or fourth class are bound to servile attendance on the higher classes especially the brahmans but they may follow mechanical occupations and practical arts painting and writing or become traders or husbandmen consequently they sometimes grow rich and it will also sometimes happen that brahmans become poor that the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https its usual consequence and rich sudras sometimes employ poor brahmans in menial occupations there is another class lower even than the sudras it is not one of the original pure classes but springs from an unauthorize d union of individuals of different castes these are the pariahs who are employed in the lowest services and treated with the utmost severity they are compelled to what one else can without pollution they are not only considered unclean themselves but they render unclean everything they touch they are deprived of all civil rights and stigmatized by particula r laws regulating their mode of life their houses and their furniture they are not allowed to visit the pagodas or temples of the other castes but have their own pagodas and religious exercises they are not suffered to enter the houses of the other castes if it is done incautiously or from necessity the place must be puriﬁed by religious ceremonies they must not appear at public markets and are conﬁned to the use of particular wells which they are obliged to surround with bones of animals to warn others against using them they dwell in miserable hovels distant from cities and villages and are under restrictions in regard to food which last is not privilege but mark of ignominy if they were so degraded that nothing could pollute them the three higher castes are prohibited entirely the use of ﬂesh the fourth is allowed to use all kinds except beef but only the lowest caste is allowed every kind of food without restriction buddha buddha whom the vedas represent delusive incarnation of vishnu is said by his followers to have been mortal sage whose name was gautama called also by the complimentary epithets of

doubted of the soundness of his mind but his doctrines soon gained credit and were propagated so rapidly that buddha himself lived to see them spread all over india he died at the age of eighty years the buddhists reject entirely the authority of the vedas and the religious observances prescribed in them and kept by the hindus they also reject the distinction of castes and prohibit all bloody

to open the wallet he found the giant had tied it up so tight he could not untie single knot at last thor became wroth and grasping his mallet with both hands he struck furious blow on the giant head skrymir awakening merely asked whether leaf had not fallen on his head and whether they had supped and were ready to go to sleep thor answered that they were just going to sleep and so saying went and laid himself down under another tree but sleep came not that night the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https and when skrymir snored again so loud that the forest

was still time sleep he howev er resolved that if he had an opportuni ty of striking third blow it should settle all matters between them little before daybreak he perceived that skrymir was again fast asleep and again grasping his mallet he dashed it with such violence that it forced its way into the giant skull up to the handle but skrymir sat up and stroking his cheek said an acorn fell on my head what art thou awake thor thinks it is time us to get up and dress ourselves but you have not now long way before you to the city called utgard i have heard you whispering to one another that i

was good ground running on and calling young man named hugi bade him run match with thialﬁ in the ﬁrst course hugi so much his competitor that he turned back and met him not far from the starting place then they ran second and third time but thialﬁ met with better success then asked thor in what feats he would choose to give proofs of that prowess which he was so famous thor answered that he would try with any one bade his bring the large horn which his followers were obliged to empty when they had trespassed in any way against the law of the feast the cupbearer having presented it to thor said whoever is good drinker will empty that horn at single draught though most men make two of it but the most puny drinker can it in three thor looked at the horn which seemed of extraordinary size though somewhat long however he was very thirsty he set it to his lips and without drawing breath pulled long and deeply he could that he might not be obliged to make second draught of it but when he set the horn down and looked in he could scarcely perceive that the liquor was diminished after taking breath thor went to it again with all his might but when he took the horn from his mouth it seemed to him that he had drunk rather less than before although the horn could now be carried without spilling how now thor said thou must not spare thyself if thou meanest to drain the horn at the third draught thou must pull deeply and i must needs say that thou wilt not be called so mighty man here thou art at home if thou showest greater prowess in other feats than methinks will be shown in this thor full of wrath again set the horn to his lips and did his best to empty it but on looking in found the liquor was only little lower so he resolved to make further attempt but gave back the horn to the i now see plainly said that thou art not quite so stout we thought thee but wilt thou try any other feat though methinks thou art not likely to bear any prize away with thee hence what new trial hast thou to propose said thor we have very triﬂing game here answered in which we exercise none but children it consists in merely lifting my cat from the ground nor should i have dared to mention such feat to the great thor if i had not already observed that thou art by means what we took thee he ﬁnished speaking large gray cat sprang on the hall ﬂoor thor put his hand under the cat belly and did his utmost to raise him from the ﬂoor but the cat bending his back had notwithstanding all thor efforts only one of his feet lifted up seeing which thor made further attempt this trial has turned out said just i imagined it would the cat is large but thor is little in comparison to our men the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https little ye call answered thor let see who among you will come hither now i am in wrath and wrestle with i see one here said looking at the men sitting on the benches who would not think it beneath him to wrestle with thee let somebody however call hither that old crone my nurse elli and let thor wrestle with her if he will she has thrown to the ground many man not less strong than this thor is toothless old woman then entered the hall and was told by to take hold of thor the tale is shortly told the more thor tightened his hold on the crone the ﬁrmer she stood at length after very violent struggle thor began to lose his footing and was ﬁnally brought down upon one knee oki then told them to desist adding that thor had now occasion to ask any one else in the hall to wrestle with him and it was also getting late so he showed thor and his companions to their seats and they passed the night there in good cheer the next morning at break of day thor and his companions dressed themselves and prepared their departure ordered table to be set them on which there was lack of victuals or drink after the repast led them to the gate of the city and on parting asked thor how he thoug ht his journey had turned out and whet her he had met with any men stronger than himself thor told him that he could not deny but that he had brought great shame on himself and what grieves most he added is that ye will call person of little worth nay said it behooves to tell thee the truth now thou art out of the city which so long i live and have my way thou shalt never enter again and by my troth had i known beforehand that thou hadst so much strength in thee and wouldst have brought so near to great mishap i would not have suffered thee to enter this time know then that i have all along deceived thee by my illusions ﬁrst in the forest where i tied up the wallet with iron wire so that thou couldst not untie it after this thou gavest three blows with thy mallet the ﬁrst though the least would have ended my days had it fallen on but i slipped aside and thy blows fell on the mountain where thou wilt ﬁnd three glens one of them remarkably deep these are the dints made by thy mallet i have made use of similar illusions in the contests you have had with my followers in the ﬁrst loki like hunger itself devoured all that was set before him but logi was in reality nothing else than fire and therefore consumed not only the meat but the trough which held it hugi with whom thialﬁ contended in running was thought and it was impossible thialﬁ to keep pace with that when thou in thy turn didst attempt to empty the horn thou didst perform by my troth deed so marvellou s that had i not seen it myself i should never have believed it one end of that horn reached the sea which thou wast not aware of but when thou comest to the shore thou wilt perceive how much the sea has sunk by thy draughts thou didst perform feat less wonderful by lifting up the cat and to tell thee the truth when we saw that one of his paws was off the ﬂoor we were all of us terror what thou tookest cat was in reality the midgard serpent that encompasseth the earth and he was so stretched by thee that he was barely long enough to enclose it between his head and tail thy wrestling with elli was also most astonishing feat there was never yet man nor ever will be whom old age such in fact was elli will not sooner or later lay low but now we are going to part let tell thee that it will the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https both of us if thou never come near again shouldst thou so i shall again defend myself by other illusions so that thou wilt only lose thy labor and get fame from the contest with on hearing these words thor in rage laid hold of his mallet and would have launched it at him but had disappeared and when thor would have returned to the city to destroy it he found nothing around him but verdant plain chapter xl the death of lied the death of baldur baldur the good having been tormented with terrible dreams indicating that his life was in peril told them to the assembled gods who resolved to conjure all things to avert from him the threatened danger then frigga the wife of odin exacted an oath from ﬁre and water from iron and all other metals from stones trees diseases beasts birds poisons and creeping things that none of them would any harm to baldur odin not satisﬁed with all this and feeling alarmed the fate of his son determined to consult the prophetess angerbode giantess mother of fenris hela and the midgard serpent she was dead and odin was forced to seek her in hela dominions this descent of odin forms the subject of gray ﬁne ode beginning uprose the king of men with speed and saddled straight his steed but the other gods feeling that what frigga had done was quite sufﬁcient amused themselves with using baldur mark some hurling darts at him some stone s while others hewed at him with their swords and what they would none of them could harm him and this became favorite pastime with them and was regarded an honor shown to baldur but when loki beheld the scene he was sorely vexed that baldur was not hurt assuming therefore the shape of woman he went to fensalir the sion of frigga that goddess when she saw the pretended woman inquired of her if she knew what the gods were doing at their meetings she replied that they were throwing darts and stones at baldur without being able to hurt him ay said frigga neither stones nor sticks nor anything else can hurt baldur i have exacted an oath from all of them what exclaimed the woman have all things sworn to spare baldur all things replied frigga except one little shrub that grows on the eastern side of valhalla and is called mistletoe and which i thought too young and feeble to crave an oath from the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https soon loki heard this he went away and resuming his natural shape cut off the mistletoe and repaired to the place where the gods were assembled there he found hodur standing apart without partaking of the sports on account of his blindness and going up to him said why dost thou not also throw something at baldur because i am blind answered hodur and see not where baldur is and have moreover nothing to throw come then said loki like the rest and show honor to baldur by throwing this twig at him and i will direct thy arm towards the place where he stands hodur then took the mistletoe and under the guidance of loki darted it at baldur who pierced through and through fell down lifeless surely never was there witnessed either among gods or men more atrocious deed than this when baldur fell the gods were struck speechless with horror and then they looked at each other and all were of one mind to lay hands on him who had done the deed but they were obliged to delay their vengeance out of respect the sacred place where they were assembled they gave vent to their grief by loud lamentations when the gods came to themselves frigga asked who among them wished to gain all her love and good will this said she shall he have who will ride to hel and offer hela ransom if she will let baldur return to asgard whereupon hermod surnamed the nimble the son of odin offered to undertake the journey odin horse sleipnir which has eight legs and can outrun the wind was then led forth on which hermod mounted and galloped away on his mission the space of nine days and many nights he rode through deep glens so dark that he could not discern anything until he arrived at the river gyoll which he passed over on bridge covered with glittering gold the maiden who kept the bridge asked him his name and lineage telling him that the day before ﬁve bands of dead persons had ridden over the bridge and did not shake it much he alone but she added thou hast not death hue on thee why then ridest thou here on the way to hel i ride to hel answered hermod to seek baldur hast thou perchance seen him pass this way she replied baldur hath ridden over gyoll bridge and yonder lieth the way he took to the abodes of death hermod pursued his journey until he came to the barred gates of hel here he alighted girthed his saddle tighter and remounting clapped both spurs to his horse who cleared the gate by tremendous leap without touching it hermod then rode on to the palace where he found his brother baldur occupying the most distinguished seat in the hall and passed the night in his company the next morning he besough t hela to let baldur ride home with him assuring her that nothing but lamentations were to be heard among the gods hela answered that it should now be tried whether baldur was so beloved he was said to be if therefore she added all things in the world both living and lifeless weep him then shall he return to life but if any one thing speak against him or refuse to weep he shall be kept in hel hermod then rode back to asgard and gave an account of all he had heard and witnessed the gods upon this despatched messengers throughout the world to beg everything to weep in order that baldur might be delivered from hel all things very willingly complied with the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https both men and every other living being well earths and stones and trees and metals just we have all seen these things weep when they are brought from cold place into hot one the messengers were retur ning they found an old hag named thaukt sitting in cavern and begged her to weep baldur out of hel but she answered thaukt will wail w ith dry tears baldur let hela keep her own it was strongly suspected that this hag was other than loki himself who never ceased to work evil among gods and men so baldur was prevented from coming back to asgard footnote in longfellow poems will be found poem entitled tegner drapa upon the subject of baldur death the gods took up the dead body and bore it to the seashore where stood baldur ship hringham which passed the largest in the world baldur dead body was put on the funeral pile on board the ship and his wife nanna was so struck with grief at the sight that she broke her heart and her body was burned on the same pile her husband there was vast concourse of various kinds of people at baldur obsequies first came odin accompanied by frigga the valkyrie and his ravens then frey in his car drawn by gullinbursti the boar heimdall rode his horse gulltopp and freya drove in her chariot drawn by cats there were also great many frost giants and giants of the mountain present baldur horse was led to the pile fully caparisoned and consumed in the same ﬂames with his master but loki did not escape his deserved punishment when he saw how angry the gods were he ﬂed to the mountain and there built himself hut with four doors so that he could see every approaching danger he invented net to catch the ﬁshes such ﬁshermen have used since his time but odin found out his place and the gods assembled to take him he seeing this changed himself into salmon and lay hid among the stones of the brook but the gods took his net and dragged the brook and loki ﬁnding he must be caught tried to leap over the net but thor caught him by the tail and compressed it so that salmons ever since have had that part remarkably ﬁne and thin they bound him with chains and suspended serpent over his head whose venom falls upon his face drop by drop his wife siguna sits by his side and catches the drops they fall in cup but when she carries it away to empty it the venom falls upon loki which makes him howl with horror and twist his body about so violently that the whole earth shakes and this produces what men call earthquakes the elves the edda mentions another

divinity and the gods are in general represented less warlike in character than those in the scandinavian myths whole however teutonic mythology runs along almost identical lines with that of the northern nations the most notable diver gence is due to modiﬁcations of the legends by reason of the difference in climatic conditions the more advanced social condition of the germans is also apparent in their mythology the nibelungen lied one of the oldest myths of the teuton ic race is found in the great national epic of the nibelungen lied which dates back to the prehistoric when wotan frigga thor loki and the other gods and goddesses were worshipped in the german forests the epic is divided into two parts the ﬁrst of which tells how siegfried the youngest of the kings of the netherlands went to worms to ask in marriage the hand of kriemhild sister of gunther king of burgundy while he was staying with gunther siegfried helped the burgundian king to secure his wife brunhild queen of issland the latter had announced publicly that he only should be her husband who could beat her in hurling spear throwing huge stone and in leaping siegfried who possessed cloak of invisibility aided gunther in these three contests and brunhild became his wife in return these services gunther gave siegfried his sister kriemhild in marriage after some time had elapsed siegfried and kriemhild went to visit gunther when the two women fell into dispute about the relative merits of their husbands kriemhild to exalt siegfried boasted that it was to the latter that gunther owed his victories and his wife brunhild in great anger employed hagan liegeman of gunther to murder siegfried in the epic hagan is described follows and was that redoubted guest long were his legs and sinewy and deep and broad his chest his hair that once was sable with gray was dashed of late most terrible his visage and lordly was his gait lied stanza this achilles of german romance stabbed siegfried between the shoulders the unfortunate king of the netherlands was stooping to drink from brook during hunting the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https second part of the epic relates how thirteen years later kriemhild married etzel king of the huns after time she invited the king of burgundy with hagan and many others to the court of her husband fearful quarrel was stirred up in the banquet hall which ended in the slaughter of all the burgundians but gunther and hagan these two were taken prisoners and given to kriemhild who with her own hand cut off the heads of both this bloody act of vengeance kriemhild was herself slain by hildebrand magician and champion who in german mythology holds place to an extent corresponding to that of nestor in the greek mythology the nibelungen hoard this was mythical mass of gold and precious stones which siegfried obtained from the nibelungs the people of the north whom he had conquered and whose country he had made tributary to his own kingdom of the netherlands upon his marriage siegfried gave the treasure to kriemhild her wedding portion after the murder of siegfried hagan seized it and buried it secretly beneath the rhine at lochham intending to recover it at future period the hoard was lost forever when hagan was killed by kriemhild its wonders are thus set forth in the poem was much twelve

and gold were all the world bought from it and down the value told not mark the less would there be left than erst there was i ween lied xix whoever possessed the nibelungen hoard were termed nibelungers thus at one time certain people of norway were so called when siegfried held the treasure he received the title king of the nibelungers wagner nibelungen ring though richard wagner of the nibelungen ring bears some resemblance to the ancient german epic it is wholly independent composition and was derived from various old songs and sagas which the dramatist wove into one great harmonious story the principal source was the volsunga saga while lesser parts were taken from the elder edda and the younger edda and others from the nibelungen lied the ecklenlied and other teutonic folklore in the drama there are at ﬁrst only four distinct races gods the giants the dwarfs and the nymphs later by special creation there come the valkyrie and the heroes the gods are the noblest and highest race and dwell ﬁrst in the mountain meadows later in the palace of valhalla on the heights the giants are great and strong race but lack wisdom they hate what is noble and are enemies of the gods they dwell in caves near the earth surface the the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https nibelungs are black uncouth pigmies hating the good hating the gods they are

in the depths of the rhine guarded by the innocent alberich the dwarf forswears love to gain this gold he makes it into magic ring it gives him all power and he gathers by it vast amount of treasures meanwhile wotan chief of the gods has engaged the giants to build him noble castle valhalla from whence to rule the world promising in payment freya goddess of youth and love but the gods ﬁnd they can

the the second part the valkyrie relates how wotan still covets the ring he can not take it himself he has given his word to the giants he stands or falls by his word so he devises an artiﬁce to get the ring he will get to work him and recover the ring and the treasures siegmund and sieglinda are twin children of this new race sieglinda is carried off child and is forced into marriage with hunding siegmund comes and unknowingly breaks the law of marriage but wins nothung the great sword and bride brunhild chief of the valkyrie is commissioned by wotan at the instance of fricka goddess of marriage to slay him his sin she disobeys and tries to save him but hunding helped by wotan slays him sieglinda however about to bear the free hero to be called siegfried is saved by brunhild and hid in the forest brunhild herself is punished by being made mortal wom an she is left sleeping on the mountains with wall of ﬁre around her which only hero can penetrate the drama continues with the story of siegfried which opens with scene in the smithy between mime the dwarf and siegfried mime is welding sword and siegfried scorns him mime tells him something of his mother sieglinda and shows him the broken pieces of his father sword wotan comes and tells mime that only one who has fear can remake the sword now siegfried knows fear and soon remakes the sword nothung wotan and alberich come

material are referred to professor sawyer book on teutonic legends in the nibelungen lied and the nibelungen ring where the matter is treated in full detail very thorough and clear analysis of the ring wagner gives it with study of the musical motifs probably nothing is better general readers than the volume the epic of sounds by freda winworth the more scholarly work of professor lavignac is indispensable the student of wagner dramas there is much illuminating comment on the sources and materials in legends of the wagner drama by weston chapter the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https druids the druids were the priests or ministers of religion among the ancient celtic nations in gaul britain and germany our inform ation respecting them is borrowed from notices in the greek and roman writers compared with the remains of welsh and gaelic poetry still extant the druids combined the functions of the priest the magistrate the scholar and the physician they stood to the people of the celtic tribes in relation closely analogous to that in which the brahmans of india the magi of persia and the priests of the egyptians stood to the people respectively by whom they were revered the druids taught the existence of one god to whom they gave name be al which celtic antiquaries tell us means the life of everything or the source of all beings and which seems to have afﬁnity with the phoenician baal what renders this afﬁnity more striking is that the druids well the phoenicians identiﬁed this their supreme deity with the sun fire was regarded symbol of the divinity the latin writers assert that the druids also worshipped numerous inferior gods they used images to represent the object of their worship nor did they meet in temples or buildings of any kind the perform ance of their sacred rites circle of stones each stone generally of vast size enclosing an area of from twenty feet to thirty yards in diameter constituted their sacred place the most celebrated of these now remaining is stonehenge on salisbury plain england these sacred circles were generally situated near some stream or under the shadow of grove or oak in the centre of the circle stood the cromlech or altar which was large stone placed in the manner of table upon other stones set up on end the druids had also their high places which were large stones or piles of stones on the summits of hills these were called cairns and were used in the worship of the deity under the symbol of the sun that the druids offered sacriﬁces to their deity there can be doubt but there is some uncertainty to what they offered and of the ceremonies connected with their religious services we know almost nothing the classical roman writers afﬁrm that they offered on great occasions human sacriﬁces success in war or relief from dangerous diseases caesar has given detailed account of the manner in which this was done they have images of immense size the limbs of which are framed with twisted twigs and ﬁlled with living persons these being set on ﬁre those within are encompassed by the ﬂames many attempts have been made by celtic writers to shake the testimony of the roman historians to this fact but without success the druids observed two festivals in each year the former took place in the beginning of may and was called beltane or ﬁre of god on this occasion large ﬁre was kindled on some elevated spot in honor of the sun whose returning beneﬁcence they thus welcomed after the gloom and desolation of winter of this custom trace remains in the name given to whitsunday in parts of scotland to this day sir walter scott uses the word in the boat song in the lady of the lake the project gutenberg ebook of the age of fable by thomas bulﬁnch https ours is sapling chance sown by the fountain blooming at beltane in winter to fade etc the other great festival of the druids was called or ﬁre of peace and was held on halloweve ﬁrst of november which still retains this designation in the highlands of scotland on this occasion the druids assembled in solemn conclave in the most central part of the district to dischar ge the judicial functions of their order all questions whether public or private all crimes against person or property were at this time brought before them adjudication with these judicial acts were combined certain superstitious usages especially the kindling of the sacred ﬁre from which all the ﬁres in the district which had been beforehand scrupulously extinguished might be relighted this usage of kindling ﬁres on lingered in the british islands long after the establishment of christianity besides these two great annual festivals the druids were in the habit of observing the full moon and especially the sixth day of the moon on the latter they sought the mistletoe which grew on their favorite oaks and to which well to the oak itself they ascribed peculiar virtue and sacredness the discovery of it was an occasion of rejoicing and solemn worship they call it says pliny by word in their language which means all and having made solemn preparation feasting and sacriﬁce under the tree they drive thither two white

the mistletoe is parasitic plant and is not always nor often found on the oak so that when it is found it is the more precious the druids were the teachers of morality well of religion of their ethical teaching valuable specimen is preserved in the triads of the welsh bards and from this we may gather that their views of moral rectitude were on the whole just and that they held and inculcated many very noble and valuable principle s of conduct they were also the men of science and learning of their age and people whether they were acquainted with letters or not has been disputed though the probability is strong that they were to some extent but it is certain that they committed nothing of their doctrine their history or their poetry to writing their teaching was oral and their literature if such word may be used in such case was preserved solely by tradition but the roman writers admit that they paid much attention to the order and laws of nature and investigated and taught to the youth under their charge many things concerning the stars and their motions the size of the world and the lands and concerning the might and power of the immortal gods their history consisted in traditional tales in which the heroic deeds of their forefathers were celebrated these were apparently in verse and thus constituted part of the poetry well the history of the druids in the poems of ossian we have if not the actual productions of druidical times what may be considered faithful representations of the songs of the bards the bards were an essential part of the druidical hierarchy one author pennant says the bards were supposed to be endowed with powers equal to inspiration they were the oral historians of all past transactions public and private they were also

wales many centuries long after the druidical priesthood in its other departments became extinct at these meetings none but bards of merit were suffered to rehearse their pieces and minstrels of skill to perform judges were appointed to decide on their respective abilities and suitable degrees were conferred in the earlier period the judges were appointed by the welsh princes and after the conquest of wales by commission from the kings of england yet the tradition is that edward in revenge the inﬂuen ce of the bards in animating the resistance of the people to his sway persecuted them with great cruelty this tradition has furnished the poet gray with the subject of his celebrated ode the bard there are still occasional meetings of the lovers of welsh poetry and music held under the ancient name among hemans poems is one written an eisteddfod or meeting of welsh bards held in london may 22 it begins with description of the ancient meeting of which the following lines are part midst the eternal clif fs whose strength deﬁed the crested roman in his hour of pride and where the druid ancient cromlech frowned and the oaks breathed mysterious murmurs round there thronged the inspired of yore on plain or height in the sun face beneath the eye of light and baring unto heaven each noble head stood in the circle where none else might tread the druidical system was at its height at the time of the roman invasion under julius caesar against the druids their chief enemies these conquerors of the world directed their unsparing fury the druids harassed at all points on the mainland retreated to anglesey and iona where season they found shelter and continued their now dishonored rites the druids retained their predominance in iona and over the adjacent islands and mainland until they were supplanted and their superstitions overturned by the arrival of columba the apostle of the highlands by whom the inhabitants of that district were ﬁrst led to profess christianity iona one of the smallest of the british isles situated near rugged and barren coast surrounded by dangerous seas and possessing sources of internal wealth iona has obtained an imperishable place in history the seat of civilization and religion at time when the darkness of heathenism hung over almost the whole of northern europe lona or icolmkill is situated at the extremity of the island of mull from which it is separated by strait of half mile in breadth its distance from the mainland of scotland being miles columba was native of ireland and connected by birth with the princes of the land ireland was at that time land of gospel light while the western and northern parts of scotland were still immersed in the darkness of heathenism columba with twelve friends landed on the island of lona in the

he surmounted all opposition procured from the king gift of the island and established there monastery of which he was the abbot he was unwearied in his labors to disseminate knowledge of the scriptures throughout the highlands and islands of scotland and such was the reverence paid him that though not bishop but merely presbyter and monk the entire province with its bishops was subject to him and his successors the pictish monarch was so impressed with sense of his wisdom and worth that he held him in the highest honor and the neighboring chiefs and princes sought his counsel and availed themselves of his judgment in settling their disputes when columba landed on lona he was attended by twelve followers whom he had formed into religious body of which he was the head to these occasion required others were from time to time added so that the original number was always kept up their institution was called monastery and the superior an abbot but the system had little in common with the monastic institutions of later times the name by which those who submitted to the rule were known was that of culdees probably from the latin cultores dei of god they were body of religious persons associated together the purpose of aiding each other in the common work of preaching the gospel and teaching youth well maintaining in themselves the fervor of devotion by united exercises of worship on entering the order certain vows were taken by the members but they were not those which were usually imposed by monastic orders of these which are three celibacy poverty and culdees were bound to none except the third to poverty they did not bind themselves on the contrary they seem to have labored diligently to procure themselves and those dependent on them the comforts of life marriage also was allowed them and most of them seem to have entered into that state true their wives were not permitted to reside with them at the institution but they had residence assigned to them in an adjacent locality near lona there is an island which still bears the name of eilen nam ban women island where their husbands seem to have resided with them except when duty required

culdees was enfeebled it was not however till the thirteenth centurv that the communities of the culdees were suppressed and the members dispersed they still continued to labor individuals and resisted the inroads of papal usurpation they best might till the light of the reformation dawned on the world iona from its position in the western seas was exposed to the assaults of the norwegian and danish rovers by whom those seas were infested and by them it was repeatedly pillaged its dwellings burned and its peaceful inhabitants put to the sword these unfavorable circumstances led to its gradual decline which was expedited by the subversion of the culdees throughout scotland under the reign of popery the island became the seat of nunnery the ruins of which are still seen at the reformation the nuns were allowed to remain living in community when the abbey was dismantled iona is now chieﬂy resorted to by travellers on account of the numerous eccle siastical and sepulchral remains which are found upon it the principal of these are the cathedral or abbey church and the chapel of the nunnery besides these remains of ecclesiastical antiquity there are some of an earlier
