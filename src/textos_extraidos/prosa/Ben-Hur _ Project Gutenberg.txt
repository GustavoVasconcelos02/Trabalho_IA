caterpillar crawling from the south to the north standing on its cliffs and looking off under the path of the rising sun one sees only the desert of arabia where the east winds so hateful to vinegrowers of jericho have kept their playgrounds since the beginning its feet are well covered by sands tossed from the euphrates there to lie the mountain is wall to the lands of moab and ammon on the which else had been of the desert part the arab has impressed his language upon everything south and east of judea so in his tongue the old jebel is the parent of numberless wadies which intersecting the roman dim suggestion of what once it was dusty path syrian pilgrims to and from their furrows deepening they go to pass the torrents of the rainy season into the jordan or their last receptacle the dead sea out of one of these more particularly out of that one which rises at the extreme end of the jebel and extending east of north becomes at length the bed of the jabbok traveller passed going to the of the desert to this person the attention of the reader is ﬁrst besought judged by his appearance he was quite years old his beard once of the deepest black ﬂowing broadly over his breast was streaked with white his face was brown parched berry and so hidden by red kuﬁyeh the kerchief of the head is at this day called by the children of the desert to be but in part visible now and then he raised his eyes and they were large and dark he was clad in the ﬂowing garments so universal in the east but their style may not be described more particularly he sat under miniature tent and rode great white dromedary it may be doubted if the people of the west ever overcome the impression made upon them by the ﬁrst view of camel equipped and loaded the desert custom so fatal to other novelties affects this feeling but little at the end of long journeys with caravans after years of residence with the bedawin the born wherever they may be will stop and wait the passing of the stately brute the charm is not in the ﬁgure which not even love can make beautiful nor in the movement the noiseless stepping or the broad careen is the kindness of the sea to ship so that of the desert to its creature it clothes him with all its mysteries in such manner too that while we are looking at him we are thinking of them therein is the wonder the animal which now came out of the wady might well have claimed the customary homage its color and height its breadth of foot its bulk of body not fat but overlaid with muscle its long slender neck of swanlike curvature the head wide between the eyes and tapering to muzzle which lady s bracelet might have almost clasped its motion step long and elastic tread sure and l certiﬁed its syrian blood old the days of cyrus and absolutely priceless there was project gutenberg https bridle covering the forehead with scarlet fringe and garnishing the throat with pendent brazen chains each ending with tinkling silver bell but to the bridle there was neither rein the rider nor strap driver the furniture perched on the back was an invention which with any other people than of the east would have made the inventor renowned it consisted of two wooden boxes scarce four feet in length balanced so that one hung at each side the inner space softly lined and carpeted was arranged to allow the master to sit or lie half reclined over it all was stretched green awning broad back and breast straps and girths secured with countless knots and ties held the device in place in such manner the ingenious sons of cush had contrived to make comfortable the sunburnt ways of the wilderness along which lay their duty often their pleasure when the dromedary lifted itself out of the last break of the wady the traveller had passed the boundary of el belka the ancient ammon it was before him was the sun half curtained in ﬂeecy mist before him also spread the desert not the realm of drifting sands which was farther on but the region where the herbage began to dwarf where the surface is strewn with boulders of granite and gray and brown stones interspersed with languishing acacias and tufts of the oak bramble and arbutus lay behind if they had come to line looked over into the waste and crouched with fear and now there was an end of path or road more than ever the camel seemed insensibly driven it lengthened and quickened its pace its head pointed straight towards the horizon through the wide nostrils it drank the wind in great draughts the litter swayed and rose and fell like boat in the waves dried leaves in occasional beds rustled underfoot sometimes perfume like absinthe sweetened all the air lark and chat and leaped to wing and white partridges ran whistling and clucking out of the way more rarely fox or hyena quickened his gallop to study the intruders at safe distance off to the right rose the hills of the jebel the veil resting upon them changing momentarily into purple which the sun would make matchless little later over their highest peaks vulture sailed on broad wings into widening circles but of all these things the tenant under the green tent saw nothing or at least made sign of recognition his eyes were ﬁxed and dreamy the going of the man like that of the animal was one being led two hours the dromedary swung forward keeping the trot steadily and the line due east in that time the traveller never changed his position nor looked to the right or left on the desert distance is not measured by miles or leagues but by the saat or hour and the manzil or halt three and half leagues ﬁll the former ﬁfteen or the latter but they are the rates the common camel carrier of the genu ine syrian stock can make three leagues easily at full speed he overtakes the ordinary winds one of the results of the rapid advance the face of the landscape underwent change the jebel stretched along the western horizon like ribbo tell or hummock of clay and cemented sand arose here and there now and then basaltic stones lifted their round crowns outposts of the mountain against the forces of the plain all else however was sand sometimes smooth the beaten beach then heaped in rolling ridges here chopped waves there long swells so too project gutenberg https of the atmosphere changed the sun high risen had drunk his ﬁll of dew and mist and warmed the breeze that kissed the wanderer under the awning far and near he was tinting the earth with faint and shimmering all the sky two hours more passed without rest or deviation from the course vegetation entirely ceased the sand so crusted on the surface that it broke into rattling ﬂakes at every step held undisputed sway the jebel was out of view and there was landmark visible the shadow that before followed had now shifted to the north and was keeping even race with the objects which cast it and there was sign of halting the conduct of the traveller became each moment more strange one be it remembered seeks the desert ground life and business traverse it by paths along which the bones of things dead are strewn so many blazons such are the roads from well to well from pasture to pasture the heart of the most veteran sheik beats quicker when he ﬁnds himself alone in the pathless tracts so the man with whom we are dealing could not have been in search of pleasure neither was his manner that of fugitive not once did he look behind him in such situations fear and curiosity are the most common sensations he was not moved by them when men are lonely they stoop to any companionship the dog becomes comrade the horse friend and it is shame to shower them with caresses and speeches of love the camel received such token not touch not word exactly at noon the dromedary of its own will stopped and uttered the cry or moan peculiarly piteous by which its kind always protest against an overload and sometimes crave attention and rest the master thereupon bestirr ed himself waking it were from sleep he threw the curtains of the houdah up looked at the sun surveyed the country on every side long and carefully if to identify an appointed place satisﬁed with the inspection he drew deep breath and nodded much to say at last at last moment after he crossed his hands upon his breast bowed his head and prayed silently the pious duty done he prepared to dismount from his throat proceeded the sound heard doubtless by the favorite camels of ikh ikh signal to kneel slowly the animal obeyed grunting the while the rider then put his foot upon the slender neck and stepped upon the project gutenberg https ii the man now revealed was of admirable proportions not so tall powerful loosening the silken rope which held the kuﬁyeh on his head he brushed the fringed folds back until his face was strong face almost negro in color yet the low broad forehead aquiline nose the outer corners of the eyes turned slightly upward the hair profuse straigh t harsh of metallic lustre and falling to the shoulder in many plaits were signs of origin impossible to disguise so looked the pharaohs and the later ptolemies so looked mizraim father of the egyptian race he wore the kamis white cotton shirt open in front extending to the ankles and embroidered down the collar and breast over which was thrown brown woollen cloak now in all probability it was then called the aba an outer garment with long skirt and short sleeves lined inside with stuff of mixed cotton and silk edged all round with margin of clouded yellow his feet were protected by sandals attached by thongs of soft leather sash held the kamis to his waist what was very noticeable considering he was alone and that the desert was the haunt of leopards and lions and men quite wild he carried arms not even the crooked stick used guiding camels wherefore we may at least infer his errand peaceful and that he was either uncommonly bold or under extraordinary protection the traveller s limbs were numb the ride had been long and wearisome so he rubbed his hands and stamped his feet and walked round the faithful servant whose lustrous eyes were closing in calm content with the cud he had already found often while making the circuit he paused and shading his eyes with his hands examined the desert to the extremest verge of vision and always when the survey was ended his face clouded with disappointment slight but enough to advise shrewd spectator that he was there expecting company if not by appointment at the same time the spectator would have been conscious of sharpening of the curiosity to learn what the business could be that required transaction in place so far from civilized abode however disappointed there could be little doubt of the stranger s conﬁdence in the coming of the expected company in token thereof he went ﬁrst to the litter and from the cot or box opposite the one he had occupied in coming produced sponge and small gurglet of water with which he washed the eyes face and nostrils of the camel that done from the same depository he drew circular cloth ed bundle of rods and stout cane the latter after some manipulation proved to be cunning device of lesser joints one within another which when united together formed centre pole higher than his head when the pole was planted and the rods set around it he spread the cloth over them and was literally at home much smaller than the habitations of emir and sheik yet their counterpart in all other respects from the litter again he brought carpet or square rug and covered the ﬂoor of the tent on the side from the sun that done he went out and once more and with greater care and project gutenberg https eyes swept the encircling countr except distant jackal galloping across the plain and an eagle ﬂying towards the gulf of akaba the waste below like the blue above it was lifeless he turned to the camel saying low and in tongue strange to the desert we are far from home racer with the swiftest winds are far from home but god is with us let us be then he took some beans from pocke t in the saddle and put them in bag made to hang below the animal s nose and when he saw the relish with which the good servant took to the food he turned and again scanned the world of sand dim with the glow of the vertical sun they will come he said calmly he that led is leading them i will make ready from the pouches which lined the interior of the cot and from willow basket which was part of its furniture he brought forth materials meal platters of the ﬁbres of palms wine in small gurglets of skin mutton dried and smoked stoneless shami or syrian pomegranates dates of el shelebi wondrous rich and grown in the nakhil or palm orchards of central arabia cheese like david s slices of milk and leavened bread from the city which he carried and set upon the carpet under the tent the ﬁnal preparation about the provisions he laid three pieces of silk cloth used among reﬁned people of the east to cover the knees of guests while at circumstance signiﬁcant of the number of persons who were to partake of his the number he was awaiting all was now ready he stepped out lo in the east dark speck on the face of the desert he stood if rooted to the ground his eyes dilated his ﬂesh crept chilly if touched by something supernatural the speck grew became large hand at length assumed deﬁned proportions little later full into view swung duplication of his own dromedary tall and white and bearing houdah the travelling litter of hindostan then the egyptian crossed his hands upon his breast and looked to heaven god only is great he exclaimed his eyes full of tears his soul in awe the stranger drew last stopped then he too seemed just waking he beheld the kneeling camel the tent and the man standing prayerfully at the door he crossed his hands bent his head and prayed silently after which in little while he stepped from his camel s neck to the sand and advanced towards the egyptian did the egyptian towards him moment they looked at each other then they is each threw his right arm over the other s shoulder and the left round the side placing his chin ﬁrst upon the left then upon the right breast peace be with thee servant of the true god the stranger said and to thee brother of the true faith thee peace and welcome the egyptian replied with fervor the was tall and gaunt with lean face sunken eyes white hair and beard and complexion between the hue of cinnamon and bronze he too was unarmed his costume was hindostani over the shawl was wound in great folds forming turban his body garments were in the style of the egyptian s except that the aba was shorter exposing wide ﬂowing breeches gathered at the ankles in place of sandals his feet project gutenberg https in of red leather pointed at the toes save the slippers the costume from head to foot was of white linen the air of the man was high stately severe visvamitra the greatest of the ascetic heroes of the iliad of the east had in him perfect representative he might have been calle d life drenched with the wisdom of incarnate only in his eyes was there proof of humanity when he lifted his face from the egyptian s breast they were glistening with tears god only is great he exclaimed when the embrace was ﬁnished and blessed are they that serve him the egyptian answered wondering at the paraphrase of his own exclamation but let us wait he added let us wait see the other comes yonder they looked to the north where already plain to view third camel of the whiteness of the others came careening like ship they waited standing ted until the arrived dismounted and advanced towards them peace to you my brother he said while embracing the hindoo and the hindoo answered god s will be done the last comer was all unlike his friends his frame was slighter his complexion white mass of waving light hair was perfect crown his small but beautiful head the warmth of his eyes certiﬁed delicate mind and cordial brave nature he was bareheaded and unarmed under the folds of the tyrian blanket which he wore with unconscious grace appeared tunic sleeved and gathered to the waist by band and reaching nearly to the knee leaving the neck arms and legs bare sandals guarded his feet fifty years probably more had spent themselves upon him with other effect apparently than to tinge his demeanor with gravity and temper his words with forethought the physical organization and the brightness of soul were untouched need to tell the student from what kindred he was sprung if he came not himself from the groves of athene his ancestry did when his arms fell from the egyptian the latter said with tremulous voice the spirit brought ﬁrst wherefore i know myself chosen to be the servant of my brethren the tent is set and the bread is ready the breaking let perform my taking each by the hand he led them within and removed their sandals and washed their feet and he poured water upon their hands and dried them with napkins then when he had laved his own hand s he said let us take care of ourselves brethren our service requires and eat that we may be strong what remains of the day s duty while we eat we will each learn who the others are and whence they come and how they are he took them to the repast and seated them so that they faced each other simultaneously their heads bent forward their hands crossed upon their breasts and speakin g together they said aloud this simple grace father of we have here is of thee take our thanks and bless us that we may continue to thy with the last word they raised their eyes and looked at each other in wonder each had spoken in language never before project gutenberg https the others yet each understood perfectly what was said their souls thrilled with divine emotion by the miracle they recognized the divine project gutenberg https iii to speak in the style of the period the meeting just described took place in the year of rome the month was december and winter reigned over all the regions east of the mediterranean such ride upon the desert in this season go not far until smitten with keen appetite the company under the little tent were not exceptions to the rule they were hungry and ate heartily and after the wine they talked to wayfarer in strange land nothin g is so sweet to hear his name on the tongue of friend said the egyptian who assumed to be president of the repast before us lie many days of companionship it is time we knew each other so if it be agreeable he who came last shall be ﬁrst to then slowly at ﬁrst like one watchful of himself the greek began what i have to tell my brethren is so strange that i hardly know where to begin or what i may with propriety speak i not yet understand myself the most i am sure of is that i am doing master s will and that the service is constant ecstasy when i think of the purpose i am sent to fulﬁl there is in joy so inexpressible that i know the will is god the good man paused unable to proceed while the others in sympathy with his feelings dropped their gaze far to the west of this he began again there is land which may never be forgotten if only because the world is too much its debtor and because the indebtedness is things that bring to men their purest pleasures i will say nothing of the arts nothing of philosophy of eloquence of poetry of war my brethren hers is the glory which must shine forever in perfected letters by which he we go to ﬁnd and proclaim will be made known to all the earth the land i speak of is greece i am gaspar son of cleanthes the athenian my people he continued were given wholly to study and from them i derived the same passion it happens that two of our philosophers the very greatest of the many teach one the doctrine of soul in every man and its immortality the other the doctrine of one god inﬁnitely just from the multitude of subjects about which the schools were disputing i separated them alone worth the labor of solution i thought there was relation between god and the soul yet unknown on this theme the mind can reason to point dead impassable wall arrived there all that remains is to stand and cry aloud help so i did but voice came to over the wall in despair i tore myself from the cities and the at these words grave smile of approval lighted the gaunt face of the hindoo in the northern part of my thessaly the greek proceeded to say there is mountain famous the home of the gods where theus whom my countrymen believe supreme has his abode olympus is its name thither i betook myself i found project gutenberg https in hill where the mountain comi ng from the west bends to the southeast there i dwelt giving myself up to i gave myself up to waiting what every breath was revelation believing in god invisible yet supreme i also believed it possible so to yearn him with all my soul that he would take compassion and give answer and he did exclaimed the hindoo lifting his hands from the silken cloth upon his lap hear brethren said the greek calming himself with an effort the door of my hermitage looks over an arm of the sea over the thermaic gulf one day i saw man ﬂung overboard from ship sailing by he swam ashore i received and took care of him he was jew learned in the history and laws of his people and from him i came to know that the god of my prayers did indeed exist and had been ages their lawmaker ruler and king what was that but the revelation i dreamed of my faith had not been fruitless god answered he does all who cry to him with such faith said the hindoo but alas the egyptian added how few are there wise enough to know when he answers them that was not all the greek continued the man so sent to told more he said the prophets who in the ages which followed the ﬁrst revelation walked and talked with god declared he would come again he gave the names of the prophets and from the sacred books quoted their very language he told further that the second coming was at looked momentarily in the greek paused and the brightness of his countenance faded it is true he said after it is true the man told that god and the revelation of which he spoke had been the jews alone so it would be again he that was to come should be king of the jews had he nothing the rest of the world i asked was the answer given in proud voice we are his chosen the answer did not crush my hope why should such god limit his love and benefaction to one land and it were to one family i set my heart upon knowing at last i broke through the man s pride and found that his fathe rs had been merely chosen servants to keep the truth alive that the world might at last know it and be saved when the jew was gone and i was alone again i chastened my soul with new i might be permitted to see the king when he was come and worship him one night i sat by the door of my cave trying to get nearer the mysteries of my existence knowing which is to know god suddenly on the sea below or rather in the darkness that covered its face i saw star begin to burn slowly it arose and drew nigh and stood over the hill and above my door so that its light shone full upon i fell down and slept and in my dream i heard voice say gaspar thy faith hath conquered blessed art thou with two others come from the uttermost parts of the earth thou shalt see him that is promised and be witness him and the occasion of testimony in his behalf in the morning arise and go meet them and keep trust in the spirit that shall guide and in the morning i awoke with the spirit light within surpassing that of the sun i put off my hermit s garb and dressed myself of old from i took the treasure which project gutenberg https brought from the city ship went sailing past i hailed it was taken aboard and landed at antioch there i bought the camel and his furniture through the gardens and orchards that enamel the banks of the orontes i journeyed to emesa damascus bostra and philadelphia thence hither and so brethren you have my story let now listen to project gutenberg https iv the egyptian and the hindoo looked at each other the former waved his hand the latter bowed and began our brother has spoken well may my words be he broke of f reﬂected moment then resumed you may know brethren by the name of melchior i speak to you in language which if not the oldest in the world was at least the soonest to be reduced to mean the sanscrit of india i am hindoo by birth my people were the ﬁrst to walk in the ﬁelds of knowledge ﬁrst to divide them ﬁrst to make them beautiful whatever may hereafter befall the four vedas must live they are the primal fountains of religion and useful intelligence from them were derived the edas which delivered by brahma treat of medicine archery architecture music and the mechanical arts the revealed by inspired saints and devoted to astronomy grammar prosody pronunciation charms and incantations religious rites and ceremonies the written by the sage vyasa and given to cosmogony chronology and geography therein also are the ramayana and the mahabharata heroic poems designed the perpetuation of our gods and such brethren are the great shastras or books of sacred ordinances they are dead to now yet through all time they will serve to illustrate the budding genius of my race they were promises of quick perfection ask you why the promises failed alas the books themselves closed all the gates of progress under pretext of care the creature their authors imposed the fatal principle that man must not address himself to discovery or inventio n heaven had provided him all things needful when that condition became sacred law the lamp of hindoo genius was let down well where ever since it has lighted narrow walls and bitter waters these allusions brethren are not from pride you will understand when i tell you that the shastras teach supreme god called brahm also that the puranas or sacred poems of the angas tell us of virtue and good works and of the soul so if my brother will permit the saying speaker bowed deferentially to the ages before his people were known the two great ideas god and the soul had absorbed all the forces of the hindoo mind in further explanation let say that brahm is taught by the same sacred books vishnu and shiva of these brahma is said to have been the author of our race which in course of creation he divided into four castes first he peopled the worlds below and the heavens above next he made the earth ready terrestrial spirits then from his mouth proceeded the brahman caste nearest in likeness to himself highest and noblest sole teachers of the vedas which at the same time ﬂowed from his lips in ﬁnished state perfect in all useful knowledge from his arms next issued the kshatriya or warriors from his breast the seat of life came the vaisya or shepherds farmers merchants from his foot in sign of degradation sprang the sudra or serviles doomed to menial project gutenberg https the other domestics laborers artisans take notice further that the law so born with them forbade man of one caste becoming member of another the brahman could not enter lower order if he violated the laws of his own grade he became an outcast lost to all but outcasts like at this point the imagination of the greek ﬂashing forward upon all the consequences of such degradation overcame his eager attention and he exclaimed in such state brethren what mighty need of loving god yes added the egyptian of loving god like the brows of the hindoo knit painfully when the emotion was spent he proceeded in softened voice i was born brahman my life consequently was ordered down to its least act its last hour my ﬁrst draught of nourishment the giving my compound name taking out the ﬁrst time to see the sun investing with the triple thread by which i became one of the my induction into the ﬁrst all celebrated with sacred texts and rigid ceremonies i might not walk eat drink or sleep without danger of violating rule and the penalty brethren the penalty was to my soul according to the degrees of omission my soul went to one of the indra s the lowest brahma s the highes t or it was driven back to become the life of worm ﬂy ﬁsh or brute the reward perfect observance was beatitude or absorption into the being of brahm which was not existence much absolute the hindoo gave himself moment s thought proceeding he said the part of brahman s life called the ﬁrst order is his student life when i was ready to enter the second is to say when i was ready to marry and become questioned everything even brahm i was heretic from the depths of the well i had discovered light above and yearned to go up and see what all it shone upon at with what years of toil stood in the perfect day and beheld the principle of life the element of religion the link between the soul and love the shrunken face of the good man kindled visibly and he clasped his hands with force silence ensued during which the others looked at him the greek through tears at length he resumed the happiness of love is in action its test is what one is willing to others i could not rest brahm had ﬁlled the world with so much wretchedness the sudra appealed to so did the countless devotees and victims the island of ganga lagor lies where the sacred waters of the ganges disappear in the indian ocean thither i betook myself in the shade of the temple built there to the sage kapila in union of prayers with the disciples whom the sanctiﬁed memory of the holy man keeps around his house i thought to ﬁnd rest but twice every year came pilgrimages of hindoos seeking the puriﬁcation of the waters their misery strengthened my love against its impulse to speak i clenched my jaws one word against brahm or the triad or the shastras would doom one act of kindness to the outcast brahmans who now and then dragged themselves to die on the burning blessing said cup of water i became one of them lost to family country privileges caste the love conquered i spoke to the disciples in the temple they project gutenberg https out i spoke to the pilgrims they stoned from the island on the highways i attempted to preach my hearers ﬂed from or sought my life in all india ﬁnally there was not place in which i could ﬁnd peace or even among the outcasts though fallen they were still believers in brahm in my extremity i looked solitude in which to hide from all but god i followed the ganges to its source far up in the himalayas when i entered the pass at hurdwar where the river in unstained purity leaps to its course through the muddy lowlands i prayed my race and thought myself lost to them forever through gorges over cliffs across glaciers by peaks that seemed i made my way to the lang tso lake of marvellous beauty asleep at the feet of the tise gangri the gurla and the kailas parbot giants which ﬂaunt their crowns of snow everlastingly in the face of the sun there in the centre of the earth where the indus ganges and brahmapootra rise to run their different courses where mankind took up their ﬁrst abode and separated to replete the world leaving balk the mother of cities to attest the great fact where nature gone back to its primeval condition and secure in its immensities invites the sage and the exile with promise of safety to the one and solitude to the i went to abide alone with god praying fasting waiting again the voice fell and the bony hands met in fervent clasp one night i walked by the shores of the lake and spoke to the listening silence when will god come and claim his own is there to be redemption suddenl y light began to glow tremulously out on the water soon star arose and moved towards and stood overhead the brightness stunned while i lay upon the ground i heard voice of inﬁnite sweetness say thy love hath conquered blessed art thou son of india the redemption is at hand with two others from far quarters of the earth thou shalt see the redeemer and be witness that he hath come in the morning arise and go meet them and put all thy trust in the spirit which shall guide and from that time the light has staye d with so i knew it was the visible presence of the spirit in the morning i started to the world by the way i had come in cleft of the mountain i found stone of vast worth which i sold in hurdwar by lahore and cabool and yezd i came to ispahan there i bought the camel and thence was led to bagdad not waiting caravans alone i traveled fearless the spirit was with and is with yet what glory is ours brethren we are to see the speak to worship him i am project gutenberg https v the vivacious greek broke forth in expressions of joy and congratulations after which the egyptian said with characteristic gravity i salute you my brother you have suffered much and i rejoice in your triumph if you are both pleased to hear i will now tell you who i am and how i came to be called wait he went out and tended the camels coming back he resumed his seat your words brethren were of the spirit he said in commencement and the spirit gives to understand them you each spoke particularly of your countrie s in that there was great object which i will explain but to make the interpretation complete let ﬁrst speak of myself and my people i am balthasar the the last words were spoken quietly but with so much dignity that both listeners bowed to the speaker there are many distinctions i might claim my race he continued but i will content myself with one history began with us we were the ﬁrst to perpetuate even ts by records kept so we have traditions and instead of poetry we offer you certainty on the facades of palaces and temples on obelisks on the inner walls of tombs we wrote the names of our kings and what they did and to the delicate papyri we intrusted the wisdom of our philosophers and the secrets of our the secrets but one whereof i will presently speak older than the vedas of brahm or the of vyasa melchior older than the songs of homer or the metaphysics of plato my gaspar older than the sacred books or kings of the people of china or those of siddartha son of the beautiful maya older than the genesis of mosche the of human records are the writings of menes our ﬁrst pausing an instant he ﬁxed his large eves kindly upon the greek saying in the youth of hellas who gaspar were the teachers of her teachers the greek bowed smiling by those records balthasar continued we know that when the fathers came from the far east from the region of the birth of the three sacred rivers from the centre of the old iran of which you spoke bringing with them the history of the world before the flood and of the flood itself given to the aryans by the sons of noah they taught god the creator and the beginning and the soul deathless god when the duty which calls us now is happily done if you choose to go with i will show you the sacred library of our priesthood among others the book of the dead in which is the ritual to be observed by the soul after death has despatched it on its journey to judgment the and the immortal borne to mizraim over the desert and by him to the banks of the nile they were then in their purity easy of understanding what project gutenberg https our happiness always is so also was the ﬁrst worship song and prayer natural to soul joyous hopeful and in love with its maker here the greek threw up his hands exclaiming oh the light deepens within and in said the hindoo with equal fervor the egyptian regarded them benignantly then went on saying religion is merely the law which binds man to his creator in purity it has but these the soul and their mutual recognition out of which when put in practise spring worship love and reward this law like all others of divine that instance which binds the earth to the perfected in the beginning by its author such my brothers was the religion of the ﬁrst family such was the religi on of our father mizraim who could not have been blind to the formula of creation nowhere so discernible in the ﬁrst faith and the earliest worship perfection is god simplicity is perfection the curse of curses is that men will not let truths like these he stopped if considering in what manner to continue many nations have loved the sweet waters of the nile he said next the ethiopian the the hebrew the assyrian the persian the macedonian the whom all except the hebrew have at one time or another been its masters so much coming and going of peoples corrupted the old mizraimic faith the valley of palms became valley of gods the supreme one was divided into eight each personating creative principle in nature with at the head then isis and osiris and their circle representing water ﬁre air and other forces were invented still the multiplication went on until we had another order suggested by human qualities such strength knowledge love and the in all which there was the old folly cried the greek impulsively only the things out of reach remain they came to the egyptian bowed and proceeded yet little further my brethren little further before i come to myself what we go to will seem all the holier of comparison with what is and has been the records show that mizraim found the nile in possession of the ethiopians who were spread thence through the african desert people of rich fantastic genius wholly given to the worship of nature the poetic persian sacriﬁced to the sun the completest image of ormuzd his god the devout children of the far east carved their deities out of wood and ivory but the ethiopian without writing without books without mechanical faculty of any kind quieted his soul by the worship of animals birds and insects holding the cat sacred to re the bull to isis the beetle to pthah long struggle against their rude faith ended in its adoption the religion of the new empire then rose the mighty monuments that cumber the bank and the labyrinth pyramid and tomb of king blent with tomb of crocodile into such deep debasement brethren the sons of the aryan fell here the ﬁrst time the calmness of the egyptian forsook him though his countenance remained impassive his voice gave project gutenberg https not too much despise my countrymen he began again they did not all forget god i said awhile ago you may remember that to papyri we intrusted all the secrets of our religion except one of that i will now tell you we had king once certain pharaoh who lent himself to all manner of changes and additions to establish the new system he strove to drive the old entirely out of mind the hebrews then dwelt with us slaves they clung to their god and when the persecution became intolerable they were delivered in manner never to be forgotten i speak from the records now mosche himself hebrew came to the palace and demanded permission the slaves then millions in number to leave the country the demand was in the name of the lord god of israel pharaoh refused hear what followed first all the water that in the lakes and rivers like that in the wells and vessels turned to blood yet the monarch refused then frogs came up and covered all the land still he was ﬁrm then mosche threw ashes in the air and plague attacked the egyptians next all the cattle except of the hebrews were struck dead locusts devoured the green things of the valley at noon the day was turned into darkness so thick that lamps would not burn finally in the night all the of the egyptians died not even pharaoh s escaped then he yielded but when the hebrews were gone he followed them with his army at the last moment the sea was divided so that the fugitives passed it when the pursuers drove in after them the waves rushed back and drowned horse foot charioteers and king you spoke of revelation my the blue eyes of the greek sparkled i had the story from the jew he cried you conﬁrm it balthasar yes but through egypt speaks not mosche i interpret the marbles the priests of that time wrote in their way what they witnessed and the revelation has lived so i come to the one unrecorded secret in my country brethren we have from the day of the unfortunate pharaoh always had two private the other public one of many gods practised by the people the other of one god cherished only by the priesthood rejoice with brothers all the trampling by the many nations all the harrowing by kings all the inventions of enemies all the changes of time have been in vain like seed under the mountains waiting its hour the glorious truth has lived and is its day the wasted frame of the hindoo trembled with delight and the greek cried aloud it seems to the very desert is from gurglet of water the egyptian took draught and proceeded i was born at alexandria prince and priest and had the education usual to my class but very early i became discontented part of the faith imposed was that after death upon the destruction of the body the soul at once began its former progression from the lowest up to humanity the highest and last existence and that without reference to conduct in the mortal life when i heard of the persian s realm of light his paradise across the bridge chinevat where only the good go the thought haunted insomuch that in the day in the night i brooded over the comparative ideas eternal transmigration and eternal life in heaven if project gutenberg https taught god was just why was there distinction between the good and the bad at length it became clear to certainty corollary of the law to which i reduced pure religion that death was only the point of separation at which the wicked are left or lost and the faithful rise to higher life not the nirvana of buddha or the negative rest of brahma melchior nor the better condition in hell which is all of heaven allowed by the olympic faith gaspar but active joyous with god the discovery led to another inquiry why should the truth be longer kept secret the selﬁsh solace of the priesthood the reason the suppression was gone philosophy had at least brought us toleration in egypt we had rome instead of rameses one day in the brucheium the most splendid and crowded quarter of alexandria i arose and preached the east and west contributed to my audience students going to the library priests from the serapeion idlers from the museum patrons of the countrymen from the to hear i preached god the soul right and wrong and heaven the reward of virtuous life you melchior were stoned my auditors ﬁrst wondered then laughed i tried again they pelted with epigrams covered my god with ridicule and darkened my heaven with mockery not to linger needlessly i fell before the hindoo here drew long sigh he said the enemy of man is man my brother balthasar lapsed into silence i gave much thought to ﬁnding the cause of my failure and at last succeeded he said upon beginning again up the river day s journey from the city there is village of herdsmen and gardeners i took boat and went there in the evening i called the people together men and women the poorest of the poor i preached to them exactly i had preached in the brucheium they did not laugh next evening i spoke again and they believed and rejoiced and carried the news abroad at the third meeting society was formed prayer i returned to the city then drifting down the river under the stars which never seemed so bright and so near i evolved this lesson to begin reform go not into the places of the great and rich go rathe r to those whose cups of happiness are the poor and humble and then i laid plan and devoted my life ﬁrst step i secured my vast property so that the income would be certain and always at call the relief of the suffering from that day brethren i travelled up and down the nile in the villages and to all the tribes preaching one god righteous life and reward in heaven i have done does not become to say how much i also know that part of the world to be ripe the reception of him we go to ﬂush suffused the swarthy cheek of the speaker but he overcame the feeling and continued the years so given my brothers were troubled by one i was gone what would become of the cause i had started was it to end with i had dreamed many times of organization ﬁtting crown my work to hide nothing from you i had tried to effect it and failed brethren the world is now in the condition that to restore the old mizraimic faith the reformer must have more than human sanction he must not merely come in god s name he must have the proofs subject to project gutenberg https he must demonstrate all he says even god so preoccupied is the mind with myths and systems so much false deities crowd every air sky so have they become of everything part that return to the ﬁrst religion can only be along bloody paths through ﬁelds of persecution that is to say the converts must be willing to die rather than recant and who in this age can carry the faith of men to such point but god himself to redeem the not mean to destroy redeem the race he must make himself once more manifest he must come in intense emotion seized the three are we not going to ﬁnd him exclaimed the greek you understand why i failed in the attempt to organize said the egyptian when the spell was past i had not the sanction to know that my work must be lost made intolerably wretched i believed in prayer and to make my appeals pure and strong like you my brethren i went out of the beaten ways i went where man had not been where only god was above the ﬁfth cataract above the meeting of rivers in sennar up the bahr el abiad into the far unknown of africa i went there in the morning mountain blue the sky ﬂings cooling shadow wide over the western desert and with its cascades of melted snow feeds broad lake nestling at its base on the east the lake is the mother of the great river year and more the mountain gave home the fruit of the palm fed my body prayer my spirit one night i walked in the orchard close by the little sea the world is dying when wilt thou come why may i not see the redempt ion god so i prayed the glassy water was sparkling with stars one of them seemed to leave its place and rise to the surface where it became brilliancy burning to the eyes then it moved towards and stood over my head apparently in hand s reach i fell down and hid my face voice not of the earth said thy good works have conquered blessed art thou son of mizraim the redemption cometh with two others from the remotenesses of the world thou shalt see the saviour and testify him in the morning arise and go meet them and when ye have all come to the holy city of jerusalem ask of the people where is he that is born king of the jews we have seen his star in the east and are sent to worship him put all thy trust in the spirit which will guide and the light became an inward illumination not to be doubted and has stayed with governor and guide it led down the river to memphis where i made ready the desert i bought my camel and came hither without rest by way of suez and kuﬁleh and up through the lands of moab and ammon god is with us my brethren he paused and thereupon with prompting not their own they all arose and looked at each other i said there was purpose in the particularity with which we described our people and their histories so the egyptian proceeded he we go to ﬁnd was called king of the jews by that name we are bidden to ask him but now that we have met and heard from each other we may know him to be the redeemer not of the jews alone but of all the nations of the earth the patriarch who survived the flood had with him three sons and their families by whom the world was repeopled from the old aejo the region of delight in the project gutenberg https asia they parted india and the far east received the children of the ﬁrst the descendant of the youngest through the north streamed into europe those of the second overﬂowed the deserts about the red sea passing into africa and though most of the latter are yet dwellers in shifting tents some of them became builders along the by simultaneous impulse the three joined hands could anything be more divinely ordered balthasar continued when we have found the lord the brothers and all the generations that have succeeded them will kneel to him in homage with us and when we part to go our separate ways the world will have learned new heaven may be won not by the sword not by human wisdom but by faith love and good there was silence broken by sighs and sanctiﬁed with tears the joy that ﬁlled them might not be stayed it was the unspeakable joy of souls on the shores of the river of life resting with the redeemed in god s presence presently their hands fell apart and together they went out of the tent the desert was still the sky the sun was sinking fast the camels slept little while after the tent was struck and with the remains of the repast restored to the cot then the friends mounted and set out single ﬁle led by the egyptian their course was due west into the chilly night the camels swung forward in steady trot keeping the line and the intervals so exactly that those following seemed to tread in the tracks of the leader the riders spoke not once the moon came up and the three tall white ﬁgures sped with soundless tread through the opalescent light they appeared like specters ﬂying from hateful shadows suddenly in the air before them not farther up than low ﬂared lambent ﬂame they looked at it the apparition contracted into focus of dazzling lustre their hearts beat fast their souls thrilled and they shouted with one voice the star the star god is with us project gutenberg https vi in an aperture of the western wall of jerusalem hang the oaken valves called the bethlehem or joppa gate the area outside of them is one of the notable places of the city long before david coveted zion there was citadel there when at last the son of jesse ousted the jebusite and began to build the site of the citadel became the northwest corner of the new wall defended by tower much more imposing than the old one the location of the gate however was not disturbed the reasons most likely that the roads which met and merged in front of it could not well be transferred to any other point while the area outside had become recognized in solomon s day there was great trafﬁc at the locality shared in by traders from egypt and the rich dealers from tyre and sidon nearly three thousand years have passed and yet kind of commerce clings to the spot pilgrim wanting pin or pistol cucumber or camel house or horse loan or lentil date or dragoman melon or man dove or donkey has only to inquire the article at the joppa gate sometimes the scene is quite animated and then it suggests what place the old market must have been in the days of herod the builder and to that period and that market the reader is now to be transferred following the hebrew system the meeting of the wise men described in the preceding chapters took place in the afternoon of the day of the third month of the year that is to say on the day of december the year was the second of the 193d olympiad or the 747th of rome the of herod the great and the of his reign the fourth before the beginning of the christian the hours of the day by judean custom begin with the sun the ﬁrst hour being the ﬁrst after sunrise so to be precise the market at the joppa gate during the ﬁrst hour of the day stated was in full session and very lively the massive valves had been wide open since dawn business always aggressive had pushed through the arched entrance into narrow lane and court which passing by the walls of the great tower conducted on into the city jerusalem is in the hill country the morning air on this occasion was not little crisp the rays of the sun with their promise of warmth lingered provokingly far up on the battlements and turrets of the great piles about down from which fell the crooning of pigeons and the whir of the ﬂocks coming and going passing acquaintance with the people of the holy city strangers well residents will be necessary to an understanding of some of the pages which follow it will be well to stop at the gate and pass the scene in review better opportunity will not offer to get sight of the populace who will afterwhile go forward in mood very different from that which now possesses them the scene is at ﬁrst one of utter of action sounds colors and things it is especially so in the lane and court the ground there is paved with broad unshaped ﬂags from which each cry and jar and arises to swell the medley project gutenberg https and roars up between the solid impending walls little mixing with the throng however little familiarity with the business going on will make analysis possible here stands donkey dozing under panniers full of lentils beans onions and cucumbers brought fresh from the gardens and terraces of galilee when not engaged in serving customers the master in voice which only the initiated can understand cries his stock nothing can be simpler than his and an unbleached undyed blanket crossed over one shoulder and girt round the waist near and far more imposing and grotesque though scarcely patient the donkey kneels camel boned rough and gray with long shaggy tufts

at the corner where the lane opens out into the court some women sit with their backs against the gray stones of the wall their dress is that common to the humbler classes of the linen frock extending the full length of the person loosely gathered at the waist and veil or wimple broad enough after covering the head to wrap the shoulders their merchandise is contained in number of earthen jars such

awkward camels animals of every kind except the outlawed swine all these are there not singly described but many times repeated not in one place but everywhere in the market turning from this scene in the lane and court this glance at the sellers and their commodities the reader has need to give attention in the next place to visitors and buyers which the best studies will be found outside the gates where the spectacle is quite varied and animated indeed it may be more so there are superadded the effects of tent booth and sook greater space larger crowd more unqualiﬁed freedom and the glory

laugh if they not worse he is nazarite one of despised sect which rejects the books of moses devotes itself to abhorred vows and goes unshorn while the vows endure we watch his retiring ﬁgure suddenly there is commotion in the crowd parting quickly to the right and left with exclamations sharp and decisive then the cause man hebrew in feature and dress the mantle of linen held to his head by cords of yellow silk ﬂows free over his shoulders his robe is richly embroidered red sash with fringes of gold wraps his waist several times his demeanor is calm he even smiles upon those who with such rude haste make room him leper he is only samaritan the shrinking crowd if asked would say he is touch of the robe is pollution from whom consequently an israelite though dying might not accept life in fact the feud is not of blood when david set his throne here on mount zion with only judah to support him the ten tribes betook themselves to shechem city much older and at that date inﬁnitely richer in holy memories the ﬁnal union of the tribes did not settle the dispute thus begun the samaritans clung to their tabernacle on gerizim and while maintaining its superior sanctity laughed at the irate doctors in jerusalem time brought assuagement of the hate under herod conversion to the faith was open to all the world except the samaritans they alone were absolutely and forever shut out from

round rest squarely upon necks columnar the trunks of trees woollen tunics open at the breast sleeveless and loosely girt drape their bodies leaving bare arms and legs of such development that they at once suggest the arena and when thereto we add their careless conﬁdent insolent manner we cease to wonder that the people give them way and stop after they have passed to look at them again they are runners boxers swordsmen professionals unknown in judea before the coming of the roman fellows who what time they are not in training may be seen strolling through the king s gardens or sitting with the guards at the palace gates or possibly they are visitors from cæsarea sebaste or jericho in which herod more greek than jew and with all roman s love of games and bloody spectacles has built vast theaters and now keeps schools of drawn is the custom from the gallic provinces or the slavic tribes on the danube by bacchus says one of them drawing his clenched hand to his shoulder their skulls are not thicker than the brutal look which goes with the gesture disgusts us and we turn happily to something more pleasant opposite us is the proprietor has bald head long face and nose like the beak of hawk he sits upon carpet spread upon the dust the wall is at his back overhead hangs scant curtain around him within hand s reach and arranged upon little stools lie osier boxes full of almonds grapes ﬁgs and pomegranates to him now comes one at whom we can not help looking though another reason than that which ﬁxed our eyes upon the gladiators he is really beautiful greek around his temples holding the waving hair is crown of myrtle to which still cling the pale ﬂowers and half ripe berries his tunic scarlet in color is of the softest woollen fabric below the girdle of buff leather which

throat and falls trailing at his back his arms and legs where exposed are white ivory and of the polish impossible except by perfec t treatment with bath oil brushes and pincers the dealer keeping his

than at the cypriote i am hungry what hast thou breakfast fruits from the uch the singers of antioch take of mornings to restore the waste of their voices the dealer answers in querulous nasal tone ﬁg

intense holiness pervading the whole know him to be pharisee one of an organization in religion sect in politics party whose bigotry and power will shortly bring the world to grief the densest of the throng outside the gate covers the road leading off to joppa turning from the pharisee we are attracted by some parties who subjects of study opportunely separate themselves from the motley crowd first among them man of very noble healthfu l complexion bright black eyes beard long and ﬂowing and rich with unguents apparel costly and suitable the season he carries staff and wears suspended by cord from his neck large golden seal several servants attend him some of them with short swords stuck through their sashes when they address him it is with the utmost deference the rest of the party consists of two arabs of the pure desert stock thin wiry men deeply bronzed and with hollow cheeks and eyes of almost evil brightness on their heads red tarbooshes over their abas and wrapping the left shoulder and the body so to leave the right arm free brown woollen haicks or blankets there is loud chaffering the arabs are leading horses and trying to sell them and in their eagerness they speak in high shrill voices the courtly person leaves the talking mostly to his servants occasionally he answers with much dignity directly seeing the cypriote he stops and buys some ﬁgs and when the whole party has passed the portal close after the pharisee if we betake ourselves to the dealer in fruits he will tell with wonderful salaam that the stranger is jew one of the princes of the city who has travelled and learned the difference between the common grapes of syria and those of cyprus so surpassingly rich with the dews of the sea and so till towards noon sometimes later the steady

market at the joppa gate it was the third hour of the day and many of the people had gone away yet the press continued without apparent abatement of the there was group over by the south wall consisting of man woman and donkey which requires extended notice the man stood by the animal s head holding and leaning upon stick which seemed to have been chosen the double purpose of goad and staff his dress was like that of the ordinary jews around him except that it had an appearance of newness the mantle dropping from his head and the robe or frock which clothed his person from neck to heel were probably the garments he was accustomed to wear to the synagogue on sabbath days his features were exposed and they told of ﬁfty years of life surmise conﬁrmed by the gray that streaked his otherwise black beard he looked around him with the stare of stranger and provincial the donkey ate leisurely from an armful of green grass of which there was an abundance in the market in its sleepy content the brute did not admit of disturbance from the bustle and clamor about more was it mindful of the woman sitting upon its back in cushioned pillion an outer robe of dull woollen stuff completely covered her person while white wimple veiled her head and neck once in while impelled by curiosity to see or hear something passing she drew the wimple aside but so slightly that the face remained invisible at length the man was accosted are you not joseph of nazareth the speaker was standing close by i am so called answered joseph turning gravely around and peace be unto you my friend rabbi samuel the same give i back to the rabbi paused looking at the woman then added to you and unto your house and all your helpers be with the last word he placed one hand upon his breast and inclined his head to the woman who to see him had by this time withdrawn the wimple enough to show the face of one but short time out of girlhood thereupon the acquaintances grasped right hands if to carry them to their lips at the last moment however the clasp was let go and each kissed his own hand then put its palm upon his forehead there is so little dust upon your garments the rabbi said familiarly that i infer you passed the night in this city of our joseph replied we could only make bethany before the night came we stayed in the khan there and took the road again at the journey before you is long to joppa i project gutenberg https only to the countenance of the rabbi theretofore open and friendly became lowering and sinister and he cleared his throat with growl instead of cough yes see he said you were born in bethlehem and wend thither now with your daughter to be counted taxation ordered by cæsar the children of jacob are the tribes in egypt they have neither moses nor joshua how are the mighty fallen joseph answered without change of posture or countenance the woman is not my daughter but the rabbi clung to the political idea and he went on without noticing the explanation what are the zealots doing down in galilee i am carpenter and nazareth is village said joseph cautiously the street on which my bench stands is not road leading to any city hewing wood and sawing plank leave time to take part in the disputes of but you are jew said the rabbi earnestly you are jew and of the line of david it is not possible you can ﬁnd pleasure in the payment of any tax except the shekel given by ancient custom to joseph held his peace i not complain his friend continued of the amount of the denarius is triﬂe oh the imposition of the tax is the offense and besides what is paying it but submission to tyranny tell is it true that judas claims to be the messiah you live in the midst of his i have heard his followers say he was the messiah joseph replied at this point the wimple was drawn aside and an instant the whole face of the woman was exposed the eyes of the rabbi wandered that way and he had time to see countenance of rare beauty kindled by look of intense interest then blush overspread her cheeks and brow and the veil was returned to its place the politician got his subject your daughter is comely he said speaking lower she is not my daughter joseph repeated the curiosity of the rabbi was aroused seeing which the nazarene hastened to say further she is the child of joachim and anna of bethlehem of whom you have at least heard they were of great yes remarked the rabbi deferentially i know them they were lineally descended from david i knew them well they are dead now the nazarene proceeded they died in nazareth joachim was not rich yet he left house and garden to be divided between his daughters marian and mary this is one of them and to save her portion of the property the law required her to marry her next of kin she is now my and you her project gutenberg https yes yes and you were both born in bethlehem the roman compels you to take her there with you to be also the rabbi clasped his hands and looked indignantly to heaven exclaiming the god of israel still lives the vengeance is his with that he turned and abruptly departed stranger near by observing joseph s amazement said quietly rabbi samuel is zealot judas himself is not more joseph not wishing to talk with the man appeared not to hear and busied himself gathering in little heap the grass which the donkey had tossed abroad after which he leaned upon his staff again and waited in another hour the party passed out the gate and turning to the left took the road into bethlehem the descent into the valley of hinnom was quite broken garnished here and there with straggling wild carefully tenderly the nazarene walked by the woman s side in hand on their left reaching to the south and east round mount zion rose the city wall and on their right the steep

keeping parallel with the aqueduct from the pools of solomon until near the site of the on what is now called the hill of evil counsel there they began to ascend to the plain of rephaim the sun streamed garishly over the stony face of the famous locality and under its inﬂuence mary the daughter of joachim dropped the wimple entirely and bared her head joseph told the story of the philistines surprised in their camp there by david he was tedious in the narrative speaking with the solemn countenance and lifele ss manner of dull man she did not always hear him wherever on the land men go and on the sea ships the face and ﬁgure of the jew are familiar the physical type of the race has always been the same yet there have been some individual variations now he was ruddy and withal of beautiful countenance and goodly to look such was the son of jesse when brought before samuel the fancies of men have been ever since ruled by the description poetic license has extended the peculiarities of the ancestor to his notable descendants so all our ideal solomons have fair faces and hair and beard chestnut in the shade and of the tint of gold in the sun such we are also made believe were the locks of absalom the beloved and in the absence of authentic history tradition has dealt less lovingly by her whom we are now following down to the native city of the ruddy king she was not more than ﬁfteen her form voice and manner belonged to the period of transition from girlhood her face was perfectly oval her complexion more pale than fair the nose was faultless the lips

such think much of things impalpable often with trembling lips she raised her eyes to heaven itself not more deep ly blue often she crossed her hands upon her breast in adora tion and prayer often she raised her head like one listening eagerly calling voice now and then midst his slow utterances joseph turned to look at her and catching the expression kindling her face with light forgot his theme and with bowed head wondering plodded on so they skirted the great plain and at length reached the elevation mar elias from which across valley they beheld bethlehem the old old house of bread its white walls crowning ridge and shining above the brown scumbling of leaﬂess orchards they paused there and rested while joseph pointed out the places of sacred renown then they went down into the valley to the well which was the scene of one of the marvellous exploits of david s strong men the narrow space was crowded with people and animals fear came upon fear lest if the town were so thronged there might not be the gentle mary without delay he hurried on past the pillar of stone marking the tomb of rachel up the gardened slope saluting none of the many persons he met on the way until he stopped before the portal of the khan that then stood outside the village gates near junction of project gutenberg https ix to understand thoroughly what happened to the nazarene at the khan the reader must be reminded that eastern inns were different from the inns of the western world they were called khans from the persian and in simplest form were fenced enclosures without house or shed often without gate or entrance their sites were chosen with reference to shade defence or water such were the inns that sheltered jacob when he went to seek wife in aram their like may been seen at this day in the of the desert on the other hand some of them especially those on the roads between great cities like jerusalem and alexandria were princely establishments monuments to the piety of the kings who built them in ordinary however they were more than the house or possession of sheik in which in headquarters he swayed his tribe lodging the traveller was the least of their uses they were markets factories forts places of assemblage and residence merchants and artisans quite much places of shelter belated and wandering wayfarers within their walls all the year round occurred the multiplied daily transactions of town the singular management of these hostelries was the feature likely to strike western mind with most force there was host or hostess clerk cook or kitchen steward at the gate was all the assertion of government or proprietorship anywhere visible strangers arriving stayed at will without rendering account consequence of the system was that whoever came had to bring his food and culinary outﬁt with him or buy them of dealers in the khan the same rule held good to his bed and bedding and forage his beasts water rest shelter and protection were all he looked from the proprietor and they were gratuities the peace of synagogues was sometimes broken by brawling disputants but that of the khans never the houses and all their appurtenances were sacred well was not more so the khan at bethlehem before which joseph and his wife stopped was good specimen of its class being neither very primitive nor very princely the buildin g was purely oriental that is to say quadrangular block of rough stones one story high roofed externally unbroken by window and with but one principal doorway which was also gateway on the eastern side or front the road ran by the door so near that the chalk dust half covered the lintel fence of ﬂat rocks beginning at the northeastern corner of the pile extended many yards down the slope to point from whence it swept westwardly to limestone bluff making what was in the highest degree essential to respectable safe enclosure animals in village like bethlehem there was but one sheik there could not well be more than one khan and though born in the place the nazarene from long residenc elsewhere had claim to hospitality in the town moreover the enumeration which he was coming might be the work of weeks or months roman deputies in the provinces were proverbially slow and to impose himself and wife period so uncertain upon acquaintances project gutenberg https was out of the question so before he drew nigh the great house while he was yet climbing the slope in the steep places toiling to hasten the donkey the fear that he might not ﬁnd accommodations in the khan became painful anxiety he found the road thronged with men and boys who with great ado were taking their cattle horses and camels to and from the valley some to water some to the neighboring caves and when he was come close by his alarm was not allayed by the discovery of crowd investing the door of the establishment while the enclosure adjoining broad it was seemed already full we can not reach the door joseph said in his slow way let us stop here and learn if we can what has the wife without answering quietly drew the wimple aside the look of fatigue at ﬁrst upon her face changed to one of interest she found herself at the edge of an assemblage that could not be other than matter of curiosity to her although it was common enough at the khans on any of the highways which the great caravans were accustomed to traverse there were men on foot running hither and thither talking shrilly and in all the tongues of syria men on horseback screaming to men on camels men struggling doubtfully with fractious cows and frightened sheep men peddling bread and wine and among the mass herd of boys apparently in chase of herd of dogs everybody and everything seemed to be in motion at the same time possibly the fair spectator was too weary to be long attracted by the scene in little while she sighed and settled down on the pillion and if in search of peace and rest or in expectation of some one looked off to the south and up to the tall cliffs of the mount of paradise then faintly reddening under the setting sun while she was thus looking man pushed his way out of the press and stopping close by the donkey faced about with an angry brow the nazarene spoke to him i am what i take you to be good son of may i ask the cause of this multitude the stranger turned ﬁercely but seeing the solemn countenance of joseph so in keeping with his deep slow voice and speech he raised his hand in and replied peace be to you rabbi i am son of judah and will answer you i dwell in which you know is in what used to be the land of the tribe of on the road to joppa from modin said joseph ah you have been in the man said his face softening yet more what wanderers we of judah are i have been away from the ephrath our father jacob called many years when the proclamation went abroad requiring all hebrews to be numbered at the cities of their that is my business here joseph s face remained stolid mask while he remarked i have come that and my the stranger glanced at mary and kept silence she was looking up at the bald top of gedor the sun touched her upturned face and ﬁlled the violet depths of her eyes and upon her parted lips trembled an aspiration which could not have been to mortal the moment all the humanity of her beauty seemed reﬁned away she was we fancy they are who sit close by the gate in the transﬁguring light of heaven the saw the project gutenberg https what centuries after came vision of genius to sanzio the divine and left him immortal of what was i speaking ah i remember i was about to say that when i heard of the order to come here i was angry then i thought of the old hill and the town and the valley falling away into the depths of cedron of the vines and orchards and ﬁelds of grain unfailing since the days of boaz and ruth of the familiar here gibeah yonde r mar elias when i was boy were the walls of the world to and i forgave the tyrants and and rachel my wife and deborah and michal our roses of the man paused again looking abruptly at mary who was now looking at him and listening then he said rabbi will not your wife go to mine you may see her yonder with the children under the leaning at the bend of the road i tell you turned to joseph and spoke i tell you the khan is full it is useless to ask at the joseph s will was slow like his mind he hesitated but at length replied the offer is kind whether there be room us or not in the house we will go see your people let speak to the keeper myself i will return quickly and putting the in the stranger s hand he pushed into the stirring crowd the keeper sat on great cedar block outside the gate against the wall behind him leaned javelin dog squatted on the block by his side the peace of jehovah be with you said joseph at last confronting the keeper what you give may you ﬁnd again and when found be it many times multiplied to you and yours returned the watchman gravely though without moving i am bethlehemite said joseph in his most deliberate way is there not room there is you may have heard of of nazareth this is the house of my fathers i am of the line of these words held the nazarene s hope if they failed him further appeal was idle even that of the offer of many shekels to be son of judah was one the tribal opinion great thing to be of the house of david was yet another on the tongue of hebrew there could be higher boast thousand years and more had passed since the boyish shepherd became the successor of saul and founded royal family wars calamities other kings and the countless obscuring processes of time had respects fortune lowered his descendants to the common jewish level the bread they ate came to them of toil never more humble yet they had the beneﬁt of history sacredly kept of which genealogy was the ﬁrst chapter and the last they could not become unknown while wherever they went in israel acquaintance drew after it respect amounting to reverence if this were so in jerusalem and elsewhere certainly one of the sacred line might reasonably rely upon it at the door of the khan of bethlehem to say joseph said this is the house of my fathers was to say the truth most simply and literally it was the very house ruth ruled the wife of boaz the very house project gutenberg https jesse and his ten sons david the youngest were born the very house in which samuel came seeking king and found him the very house which david gave to the son of barzillai the friendly gileadite the very house in which jeremiah by prayer rescued the remnant of his race ﬂying before the babylonians the appeal was not without effect the keeper of the gate slid down from the cedar block and laying his hand upon his beard said respectfully rabbi i can not tell you when this door ﬁrst opened in welcome to the traveller but it was more than thousand years ago and in all that time there is known instance of good man turned away save when there was room to rest him in if it has been so with the stranger just cause must the steward have who says to one of the line of david wherefore i salute you again and if you care to go with i will show you that there is not left in the house neither in the chambers nor in the lewens nor in the even on the roof may i ask when you came but now the keeper smiled the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be one born among you and thou shalt love him is not that the law rabbi joseph was silent if it be the law can i say to one long time come go thy way another is here to take thy place yet joseph held his peace and if i said so to whom would the place belong see the many that have been waiting some of them since who are all these people asked joseph turning to the crowd and why are they here at this time that which doubtless brought you decree of the cæsar keeper threw an interrogative glance at the nazarene then brought most of those who have lodging in the house and yesterday the caravan passing from damascus to arabia and lower egypt arrived these you see here belong to men and still joseph persisted the court is lar ge he said yes but it is heaped with bales of silk and pockets of spices and goods of every then moment the face of the applicant lost its stolidity the lustreless staring eyes dropped with some warmth he next said i not care myself but i have with my wife and the night is on these heights than in nazareth she can not live in the open air is there not room in the town these people keeper waved his hand to the throng before the have all besought the town and they report its accommodations all again joseph studied the ground saying half to himself she is so young if i make her bed on the hill the frosts will kill her then he spoke to the keeper again it may be you knew her parents joachim and anna once of bethlehem and like myself of the line of project gutenberg https yes i knew them they were good people that was in my this time the keeper s eyes sought the ground in thought suddenly he raised his head if i can not make room you he said i can not turn you away rabbi i will the best i can you how many are of your party joseph reﬂected then replied my wife and friend with his family from little town over by joppa in all six of very well you shall not lie out on the ridge bring your people and hasten when the sun goes down behind the mountain you know the night comes quickly and it is nearly there now i give you the blessing of the houseless traveller that of the sojourner will follow so saying the nazarene went back joyfully to mary and the in little while the latter brought up his family the women mounted on donkeys the wife was matronly the daughters were images of what she must have been in youth and they drew nigh the door the keeper knew them to be of the humble class this is she of whom i spoke said the nazarene and these are our mary s veil was raised blue eyes and hair of gold muttered the steward to himself seeing but her so looked the young king when he went to sing before then he took the from joseph and said to mary peace to you daughter of david then to the others peace to you all then to joseph rabbi follow the party were conducted into wide passage paved with stone from which they entered the court of the khan to stranger the scene would have been curious but they noticed the lewens that yawned darkly upon them from all sides and the court itself only to remark how crowded they were by lane reserved in the stowage of the cargoes and thence by passage similar to the one at the entrance they emer ged into the enclosure adjoining the house and came upon camels horses and donkeys tethered and dozing in close groups among them were the keepers men of many lands and they too slept or kept silent watch they went down the slope of the crowded yard slowly the dull carriers of the women had wills of their own at length they turned into path running towards the gray limestone bluff overlooking the khan on the west we are going to the cave said joseph laconically the guide lingered till mary came to his side the cave to which we are going he said to her must have been resort of your ancestor david from the ﬁeld below us and from the well down in the valley he used to drive his ﬂocks to it safety and afterwards when he was king he came back to the old house here rest and health bringing great trains of animals the mangers yet remain they were in his day better bed on the ﬂoor where he has slept than one in the or out by the roadside ah here is the house before the cave project gutenberg https speech must not be taken an apology the lodging offered there was need of apology the place was the best then at disposal the guests were simple folks by habits of life easily satisﬁed to the jew of that period moreover abode in caverns was familiar idea made so by occurrences and by what he heard of sabbaths in the synagogues how much of jewish history how many of the many exciting incidents in that history had transpired in caves yet further these people were jews of bethlehem with whom the idea was especially commonplace their locality abounded with caves great and small some of which had been from the time of the emim and horites more was there offence to them in the fact that the cavern to which they were being taken had been or was stable they were the descendants of race of herdsmen whose ﬂocks habitually shared both their habitations and wanderings in keeping with custom derived from abraham the tent of the bedawin yet shelters his horses and children alike so they obeyed the keeper cheerfully and gazed at the house feeling only natural curiosity everything associated with the history of david was interesting to them the building was low and narrow projecting but little from the rock to which it was joined at the rear and wholly without window in its blank front there was door swung on enormous hinges and thickly daubed with ochreous clay while the wooden bolt of the lock was being pushed back the women were assisted from their pillions upon the opening of the door the keeper called out come in the guests entered and stared about them it became apparent immediately that the house was but mask or covering the mouth of natural cave or grotto probably forty feet long nine or ten high and twelve or ﬁfteen in width the light streamed through the doorway over an uneven ﬂoor falling upon piles of grain and fodder and earthenware and household property occupying the centre of the chamber along the sides were mangers low enough sheep and built of stones laid in cement there were stalls or partitions of any kind dust and chaff yellowed the ﬂoor ﬁlled all the crevices and hollows and thickened the spider which dropped from the ceiling like bits of dirty linen otherwise the place was cleanly and to appearance comfortable any of the arched lewens of the khan proper in fact cave was the model and ﬁrst suggestion of the lewen come in said the guide these piles upon the ﬂoor are travellers like yourselves take what of them you then he spoke to mary can you rest here the place is sanctiﬁed she answered i leave you then peace be with you all when he was gone they busied themselves making the cave project gutenberg https at certain hour in the evening the shouting and stir of the people in and about the khan ceased at the same time every israelite if not already upon his feet arose solemnized his face looked towards jerusalem crossed his hands upon his breast and prayed it was the sacred ninth hour when sacriﬁces were offered in the temple on moriah and god was supposed to be there when the hands of the worshippers fell down the commotion broke forth again everybody hastened to bread or to make his pallet little later the lights were put out and there was silence and then sleep about midnight some one on the roof cried out what light is that in the sky awake brethren awake and see the people half asleep sat up and looked then they became though wonder and the stir spread to the court below and into the lewens soon the entire tenantry of the house and court and enclosure were out gazing at the sky and this was what they saw ray of light beginning at height immeasurably beyond the nearest stars and dropping obliquely to the earth at its top diminishing point at its base many furlongs in width its sides blending softly with the darkness of the night its core roseate electrical splendor the apparition seemed to rest on the nearest mountain southeast of the town making pale corona along the line of the summit the khan was touched luminously so that those upon the roof saw each other s faces all ﬁlled with wonder steadily through minutes the ray linger ed and then the wonder changed to awe and fear the timid trembled the boldest spoke in whispers saw you ever the like asked one it seems just over the mountain there i can not tell what it is nor did i ever see anything like it was the answer can it be that star has burst and fallen asked another his tongue faltering when star falls its light goes i have it cried one conﬁdently the shepherds have seen lion and made ﬁres to keep him from the the men next the speaker drew breath of relief and said yes that is it the ﬂocks were grazing in the valley over there bystander dispelled the comfort though all the wood in all the valleys of judah was brought together in one pile and ﬁred the blaze would not throw light so strong and after that there was silence on the broken but once again while the mystery project gutenberg https brethren exclaimed jew of venerab le mien what we see is the ladder our father jacob saw in his dream blessed be the lord god of our fathers project gutenberg https xi mile and half it may be two miles southeast of bethlehem there is plain separated from the town by an intervening swell of the mountain besides being well sheltered from the north winds the vale was covered with growth of sycamore and pine trees while in the glens and ravines adjoining there were thickets of olive and mulberry all at this season of the year invaluable the support of sheep goats and cattle of which the wandering ﬂocks consisted at the side farthest from the town close under bluff there was an extensive marah or sheepcot ages old in some gotten foray the building had been unroofed and almost demolished the enclosure attached to it remained intact however and that was of more importance to the shepherds who drove their charges thither than the house itself the stone wall around the lot was high man s head yet not so high but that sometimes panther or lion hungering from the wilderness leaped boldly in on the inner side of the wall and an additional security against the constant danger hedge of the rhamnus had been planted an invention so successful that now sparrow could hardly penetrate the overtopping branches armed they were with great clusters of thorns hard spikes the day of the occurrences which occupy the preceding chapters number of shepherds seeking fresh walks their ﬂocks led them up to this plain and from early morning the groves had been made ring with calls and the blows of axes the bleating of sheep and goats the tinkling of bells the lowing of cattle and the barking of dogs when the sun went down they led the way to the marah and by nightfall had everything safe in the ﬁeld then they kindled ﬁre down by the gate partook of their humble supper and sat down to rest and talk leaving one on watch there were six of these men omitting the watchman and afterwhile they assembled in group near the ﬁre some sitting some lying prone they went bareheaded habitually their hair stood out in thick coarse sunburnt shocks their beard covered their throats and fell in mats down the breast mantles of the skin of kids and lambs with the ﬂeece on wrapped them from neck to knee leaving the arms exposed broad belts girthed the rude garments to their waists their sandals were of the coarsest quality from their right shoulders hung scrips containing food and selected stones slings with which they were armed on the ground near each one lay his crook symbol of his calling and weapon of offence such were the shepherds of judea in appearance rough and savage the gaunt dogs sitting with them around the blaze in fact tender effects due in part to the primitive life they led but chieﬂy to their constant care of things lovable and helpless they rested and talked and their talk was all about their ﬂocks dull theme to the world yet theme which was all the world project gutenberg https if in narrative they dwelt long upon affairs of triﬂing moment if one of them omitted nothing of detail in recounting the loss of lamb the relation between him and the unfortunate should be remembered at birth it became his charge his to keep all its days to help over the ﬂoods to carry down the hollows to name and train it was to be his companion his object of thought and interest the subject of his will it was to enliven and share his wanderings in its defense he might be called on to face the lion or die the great events such blotted out nations and changed the mastery of the world were triﬂes to them if perchance they came to their knowledge of what herod was doing in this city or that building palaces and gymnasia and indulging forbidden practises they occasionally heard was her habit in those days rome did not wait people slow to inquire about her she came to them over the hills along which he was leading his lagging herd or in the fastnesses in which he was hiding them not unfrequently the shepherd was startled by the blare of trumpets and peering out beheld cohort sometimes legion in march and when the glittering crests were gone and the excitement incident to the intrusion over he bent himself to evolve the meaning of the eagles and gilded globes of the soldiery and the charm of life so the opposite of his own yet these men rude and simple they were had knowledge and wisdom of their own on sabbath s they were accustomed to purify themselves and go up into the synagogues and sit on the benches farthest from the ark when the chazzan bore the torah round none kissed it with greater zest when the sheliach read the text none listened to the interpreter with more absolute faith and none took away with them more of the elder s sermon or gave it more thought afterwards in verse of the shema they found all the learning and all the law of their simple their lord was one god and that they must love him with all their souls and they loved him and such was their wisdom surpassing that of kings while they talked and before the ﬁrst watch was over one by one the shepherds went to sleep each lying where he had sat the night like most nights of the winter season in the hill country was clear crisp and sparkling with stars there was wind the atmosphere seemed never so pure and the stillness was more than silence it was holy hush warning that heaven was stooping low to whisper some good thing to the listening earth by the gate hugging his mantle close the watchman walked at times he stopped attracted by stir among the sleeping herds or by jackal s cry off on the the midnight was slow coming to him but at last it came his task was done now the dreamless sleep with which labor blesses its wearied children he moved towards the ﬁre but paused light was breaking around him soft and white like the moon he waited breathlessly the light deepened things before invisible came to view he saw the whole ﬁeld and all it sheltered chill sharper than that of the frosty chill of him he looked up the stars were gone the light was dropping from window in the sky he looked it became splendor then in terror he cried awake awake up sprang the dogs and howling ran away project gutenberg https herds rushed together bewildered the men clambered to their feet weapons in hand what is it they asked in one voice see cried the watchman the sky is on ﬁre suddenly the light became intolerably bright and they covered their eyes and dropped upon their knees then their souls shrank with fear they fell upon their faces blind and fainting and would have died had not voice said to them fear not and they listened fear not behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the voice in sweetness and soothing more than human and low and clear penetrated all their being and ﬁlled them with assurance they rose upon their knees and looking worshipfully beheld in the centre of great glory the appearance of man clad in robe intensely white above its shoulders towered the tops of wings shining and folded star over its forehead glowed with steady lustre brilliant hesperus its hands were stretched towards them in blessing its face was serene and divinely beautiful they had often heard and in their simple way talked of angels and they doubted not now but said in their hearts the glory of god is about us and this is he who of old came to the prophet by the river of ulai directly the angel continued unto you is born this day in the city of david savior which is christ the lord again there was rest while the words sank into their minds and this shall be sign unto you the annunciator said next ye shall ﬁnd the babe wrapped in lying in manger the herald spoke not again his good tidings were told yet he stayed awhile suddenly the light of which he seemed the centre turned roseate and began to tremble then up far the men could see there was ﬂashing of white wings and coming and going of radiant forms and voices of multitude chanting in unison glory to god in the highest and on earth peace towards men not once the praise but many times then the herald raised his eyes seeking approval of one far off his wings stirred and spread slowly and majestically on their upper side white snow in the shadow like mother when they were expanded many cubits beyond his stature he arose lightly and without effort ﬂoated out of view taking the light up with him long after he was gone down from the sky fell the refrain in measure mellowed by distance glory to god in the highest and on earth peace towards when the shepherds came fully to their senses they stared at each other stupidly until one of them said it was gabriel the lord s messenger unto none answered christ the lord is born said he not so project gutenberg https another recovered his voice and replied that is what he and did he not also say in the city of david which is our bethlehem yonder and that we should ﬁnd him babe in and lying in manger the ﬁrst speaker gazed into the ﬁre thoughtfully but at length said like one possessed of sudden resolve there is but one place in bethlehem where there are mangers but one and that is in the cave near the old khan brethren let us go see this thing which has come to pass the priests and doctors have been long time looking the christ now he is born and the lord has given us sign by which to know him let us go up and worship but the ﬂocks the lord will take care of them let us make then they all arose and left the marah around the mountain and through the town they passed and came to the gate of the khan where there was man on watch what would you have he asked we have seen and heard great things they replied well we too have seen great things but heard nothing what did you hear let us go down to the cave in the enclosure that we may be sure then we will tell you all come with us and see it is fool s the christ is the christ how you know let us go and see the man laughed scornfully the christ indeed how are you to know him he was born this night and is now lying in manger so we were told and there is but one place in bethlehem with the cave yes come with they went through the without notice although there were some up even then talking about the wonderful light the door of the cavern was open lantern was burning within and they entered unceremoniously i give you peace the watchman said to joseph and the beth dagonite here are people looking child born this night whom they are to know by ﬁnding him in and lying in manger moment the face of the stolid nazarene was moved turning away he said the child is they were led to one of the mangers and there the child was the lantern was brought and the shepherds stood by mute the little one made sign it was others just born where is the mother asked the project gutenberg https of the women took the baby and went to mary lying near and put it in her arms then the bystanders collected about the two it is the christ said shepherd at last the christ they all repeated fallin g upon their knees in worship one of them repeated several times over it is the lord and his glory is above the earth and and the simple men never doubting kissed the hem of the mother s robe and with joyful faces departed in the khan to all the people aroused and pressing about them they told their story and through the town and all the way back to the marah they chanted the refrain of the angels glory to god in the highest and on earth peace towards men the story went abroad conﬁrmed by the light so generally seen and the next day and days thereafter the cave was visited by curious crowds of whom some believed though the greater part laughed and project gutenberg https xii the eleventh day after the birth of the child in the cave about the three wise men approached jerusalem by the road from shechem after crossing brook cedron they met many people of whom none failed to stop and look after them curiously judea was of necessity an international thoroughfare narrow ridge raised apparently by the pressur of the desert on the east and the sea on the west was all she could claim to be over the ridge however nature had stretched the line of trade between the east and the south and that was her wealth in other words the riches of jerusalem were the tolls she levied on passing commerce nowhere else consequently unless in rome was there such constant assemblage of so many people of so many different nations in other city was stranger less strange to the residents than within her walls and purlieus and yet these three men excited the wonder of all whom they met on the way to the gates child belonging to some women sitting by the roadside opposite the tombs of the kings saw the party coming immediately it clapped its hands and cried look look what pretty bells what big camels the bells were silver the camels we have seen were of unusual size and whiteness and moved with singular stateliness the trappings told of the desert and of long journeys thereon and also of ample means in possession of the owners who sat under the little canopies exactly they appeared at the rendezvous beyond the jebel yet it was not the bells or the camels or their furniture or the demeanor of the riders that were so wonderful it was the question put by the man who rode foremost of the three the approach to jerusalem from the north is across plain which dips southward leaving the damascus gate in vale or hollow the road is narrow but deeply cut by long use and in places difﬁcult on account of the cobbles left loose and dry by the washing of the rains on either side however there stretched in the old time rich ﬁelds and handsome which must in luxurious growth have been beautiful especially to travellers fresh from the wastes of the desert in this road the three stopped before the party in front of the tombs good people said balthasar stroking his plaited beard and bending from his cot is not jerusalem close by yes answered the woman into whose arms the child had shrunk if the trees on yon swell were little lower you could see the towers on the balthasar gave the greek and the hindoo look then asked where is he that is born king of the jews the women gazed at each other without reply you have not heard of him well tell everybody that we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship project gutenberg https the friends rode on of others they asked the same question with like result large company whom they met going to the grotto of jeremiah were so astoni shed by the inquiry and the appearance of the travellers that they turned about and followed them into the city so much were the three occupied with the idea of their mission that they did not care the view which presently rose before them in the utmost magniﬁcence the village ﬁrst to receive them on bezetha mizpah and olivet over on their left the wall behind the village with its forty tall and solid towers superadded partly strength partly to gratify the critical taste of the kingly builder the same towered wall bending off to the right with many an angle and here and there an embattled gate up to the three great white piles phasaelus mariamne and hippicus zion tallest of the hills crowned with marble palaces and never so beautiful the glittering terraces of the temple on moriah admittedly one of the wonders of the earth the regal mountains rimming the sacred city round about until it seemed in the hollow of mighty bowl they came at length to tower of great height and strength overlooking the gate which at that time answered to the present damascus gate and marked the meetin of the three roads from shechem jericho and gibeon roman guard kept the by this time the people following the camels formed train sufﬁcient to draw the idlers hangi ng about the portal so that when balthasar stopped to speak to the sentinel the three became instantly the centre of close circle eager to hear all that passed i give you peace the egyptian said in clear voice the sentinel made reply we have come great distances in search of one who is born king of the jews can you tell us where he is the soldier raised the visor of his helmet and called loudly from an apartment at the right of the passage an ofﬁcer appeared give way he cried to the crowd whic h now pressed closer in and they seemed slow to obey he advanced twirling his javelin vigorously now right now left and so he gained room what would you he asked of balthasar speaking in the idiom of the city and balthasar answered in the same where is he that is born king of the jews herod asked the ofﬁcer confounded herod s kingship is from cæsar not there is other king of the but we have seen the star of him we seek and come to worship the roman was perplexed go farther he said at last go farthe i am not jew carry the question to the doctors in the temple or to hannas the priest or better still to herod himself if there be another king of the jews he will ﬁnd thereupon he made way the strangers and they passed the gate but before entering the narrow street balthasar lingered to say to his friends we are sufﬁciently proclaimed by project gutenberg https whole city will have heard of us and of our mission let us to the khan now project gutenberg https xiii that evening before sunset some women were washing clothes on the upper step of the ﬂight that led down into the basin of the pool of siloam they knelt each before broad bowl of earthenware girl at the foot of the steps kept them supplied with water and sang while she ﬁlled the jar the song was cheerful and doubt lightened their labor occasionally they would sit upon their heels and look up the slope of ophel and round to the summit of what is now the mount of offence then faintly gloriﬁed by the dying sun while they plied their hands rubbing and wringing the clothes in the bowls two other women came to them each with an empty jar upon her shoulder peace to you one of the said the laborers paused sat up wrung the water from their hands and returned the salutation it is nearly to there is end to work was the reply but there is time to rest to hear what may be passing interposed another what news have you then you have not heard they say the christ is born said the newsmonger plunging into her story it was curious to see the faces of the laborers brighten with interest on the other side down came the jars which in moment were turned into seats their owners the christ the listeners cried so they say who everybody it is common does anybody believe it this afternoon three men came acros s brook cedron on the road from shechem the speaker replied circumstantially intending to smother doubt each one of them rode camel spotless white and lar ger than any ever before seen in the eyes and mouths of the auditors opened wide to prove how great and rich the men were the narrator continued they sat under awnings of silk the buckles of their saddles were of gold was the fringe of their bridles the bells were of silver and made real music nobody knew them they looked if they had come from the ends of the world only one of them spoke and of everybody on the road even the women and children he asked this where is he that is born king of the jews one gave them one understood what they meant so they passed on leaving behind them this project gutenberg https we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship they put the question to the rom an at the gate and he wiser than the simple people on the road sent them up to where are they now at the khan hundreds have been to look at them already and hundreds more are who are they nobody knows they are said to be men who talk with the it may be like elijah and what they mean by king of the jews the christ and that he is just one of the women laughed and resumed her work saying well when i see him i will another followed her example and when i see him raise the dead i will third said quietly he has been long time promised it will be enough to see him heal one leper and the party sat talking until the night came and with the help of the frosty air drove them home later in the evening about the beginning of the ﬁrst watch there was an assemblage in the palace on mount zion of probably ﬁfty persons who never came together except by order of herod and then only when he had demanded to know some one or more of the deeper mysteries of the jewish law and history it was in short meeting of the teachers of the colleges of the chief priests and of the doctors most noted in the city leaders of opinion expounders of the different creeds princes of the sadducees pharisaic debaters calm stoical philosophers of the essene socialists the chamber in which the session was held belonged to one of the interior of the palace and was quite large and romanesque the ﬂoor was tessellated with marble blocks the walls unbroken by window were frescoed in panels of saffron yellow divan occupied the centre of the apartment covered with cushions of cloth and fashioned in form of the letter u the opening towards the doorway in the arch of the divan or it were in the bend of the letter there was an immense bronze tripod curiously inlaid with gold and silver over which chandelier dropped from the ceiling having seven arms each holding lighted lamp the divan and the lamp were purely jewish the company sat upon the divan after the style of orientals in costume singularly uniform except to color they were mostly men advanced in years immense beards covered their faces to their large noses were added the effects of large black eyes deeply shaded by bold brows their demeanor was grave digniﬁed even patriarchal in brief their session was that of the sanhedrim he who sat before the tripod however in the place which may be called the head of the divan having all the rest of his associates on his right and left and at the same time before him evidently president of the meeting would have instantly absorbed project gutenberg https of spectator he had been cast in large mould but was now shrunken and stooped to ghastline ss his white robe dropped from his shoulders in folds that gave hint of muscle or anything but an angular skeleton his hands half concealed by sleeves of silk white and crimson striped were clasped upon his knees when he spoke sometimes the ﬁrst ﬁnger of the right hand extended tremulously he seemed incapable of other gesture but his head was splendid dome few hairs whiter than silver fringed the base over broad skull the skin was drawn close and shone in the light with positive brilliance the temples were deep hollows from which the forehead beetled like wrinkled crag the eyes were wan and dim the nose was pinched and all the lower face was muffed in beard ﬂowing and venerable aaron such was hillel the babylonian the line of prophets long extinct in israel was now succeeded by line of scholars of whom he was ﬁrst in prophet in all but the divine inspiration at the age of one hundred and six he was still rector of the great college on the table before him lay outspread roll or volume of parchment inscribed with hebrew characters behind him in waiting stood page richly habited there had been discussion but at this moment of introduction the company had reached conclusion each one was in an attitude of rest and the venerable hillel without moving called the page hist the youth advanced respectfully go tell the king we are ready to give him answer the boy hurried away after time two ofﬁcers entered and stopped one on each side the door after them slowly followed most striking an old man clad in purple robe bordered with scarlet and girt to his waist by band of gold linked so ﬁne that it was pliable leather the latchets of his shoes sparkled with precious stones narrow crown wrought in ﬁligree shone outside tarbooshe of softest crimson plush which encasing his head fell down the neck and shoulders leaving the throat and neck exposed instead of seal dagger dangled from his belt he walked with halting step leaning heavily upon staff not until he reached the opening of the divan did he pause or look up from the ﬂoor then the ﬁrst time conscious of the company and roused by their presence he raised himself and looked haughtily round like one startled and searching an dark suspicious and threatening was the glance such was herod the body broken by diseases conscience seared with crimes mind magniﬁcently capable soul ﬁt brotherhood with the cæsars now years old but guarding his throne with jealousy never so vigilant power never so despotic and cruelty never so inexorable there was general movement on the part of the bending forward in salaam by the more aged by the more courtierly followed by low genuﬂections hands upon the beard or breast his observations taken herod moved on until at the tripod opposite the venerable hillel who met his cold glance with an inclination of the head and slight lifting of the hands the answer said the king with imperious simplicity addressing hillel and planting his staff before him with project gutenberg https the answer the eyes of the patriarch glowed mildly and raising his head and looking the inquisitor full in the face he answered his associates giving him closest attention with thee king be the peace of god of abraham isaac and jacob his manner was that of invocation changing it he resumed thou hast demanded of us where the christ should be the king bowed though the evil eyes remained ﬁxed upon the sage s face that is the then king speaking myself and all my brethren here not one dissenting i say in bethlehem of hillel glanced at the parchment on the tripod and pointing with his tremulous ﬁnger continued in bethlehem of judea thus it is written by the prophet and thou bethlehem in the land of judea art not the least among the princes of judah out of thee shall come governor that shall rule my people herod s face was troubled and his eyes fell upon the parchment while he thought those beholding him scarcely breathed they spoke not nor did he at length he turned about and left the chamber brethren said hillel we are the company then arose and in groups departed simeon said hillel again man quite ﬁfty years old but in the hearty prime of life answered and came to him take up the sacred parchment my son roll it tenderly the order was obeyed now lend thy arm i will to the litter the strong man stooped with his withered hands the old one took the of fered support and rising moved feebly to the door so departed the famous rector and simeon his son who was to be his successor in wisdom learning and ofﬁce yet later in the evening the wise men were lying in lewen of the khan awake the stones which served them pillows raised their heads so they could look out of the open arch into the depths of the sky and they watched the twinkling of the stars they thought of the next manifestation how would it come what would it be they were in jerusalem at last they had asked at the gate him they sought they had borne witness of his birth it remained only to ﬁnd him and to that they placed all trust in the spirit men listening the voice of god or waiting sign from heaven can not sleep while they were in this condition man stepped in under the arch darkening the lewen awake he said to them i bring you message which will not be put of they all sat project gutenberg https from whom asked the egyptian herod the each one felt his spirit thrill are you not the steward of the khan balthasar asked next i what would the king with us his messenger is without let him answer tell him then to abide our you were right my brother said the greek when the steward was gone the question put to the people on the road and to the guard at the gate has given us quick notoriety i am impatient let us up quickly they arose put on their sandals girt their mantles about them and went out i salute you and give you peace and pray your pardon but my master the king has sent to invite you to the palace where he would have speech with you privately thus the messenger dischar ged his duty lamp hung in the entrance and by its light they looked at each other and knew the spirit was upon them then the egyptian stepped to the steward and said so not to be heard by the others you know where our goods are stored in the court and where our camels are resting while we are gone make all things ready our departure if it should be go your way assured trust the steward replied the king s will is our will said balthasar to the messenger we will follow the streets of the holy city were narrow then now but not so rough and foul the great builder not content with beauty enforced cleanliness and convenience also following their guide the brethren proceeded without word through the dim starlight made dimmer by the walls on both sides sometimes almost lost under bridges connecting the out of low ground they ascended hill at last they came to portal reared across the way in the light of ﬁres blazing before it in two great braziers they caught glimpse of the structure and also of some guards leaning motionlessly upon their arms they passed into building unchallenged then by passages and arched halls through courts and under colonnades not always lighted up long ﬂights of stairs past innumerable cloisters and chambers they were conducted into tower of great height suddenly the guide halted and pointing through an open door said to them enter the king is the air of the chamber was heavy with the perfume of wood and all the appointments within were effeminately rich upon the ﬂoor covering the central space tufted rug was spread and upon that throne was set the visitors had but time however to catch confused idea of the f carved and gilt ottomans and couches of fans and jars and musical instruments of golden candlesticks glittering in their own lights of walls painted in the style of the voluptuous grecian school one look at which had made pharisee hide his head with holy horror herod sitting upon the throne to receive them clad when at the conference with the doctors and lawyers claimed all their project gutenberg https the edge of the rug to which they advanced uninvited they prostrated themselves the king touched bell an attendant came in and placed three stools before the throne seat yourselves said the monarch graciously from the north gate he continued when they were at rest i had this afternoon report of the arrival of three strangers curiously mounted and appearing if from far countries are you the men the egyptian took the sign from the greek and the hindoo and answered with the profoundest salaam were we other than we are the mighty herod whose fame is incense to the whole world would not have sent us we may not doubt that we are the herod acknowledged the speech with wave of the hand who are you whence you come he asked adding signiﬁcantly let each speak in turn they gave him account referring simply to the cities and lands of their birth and the routes by which they came to jerusalem somewhat disappointed herod plied them more directly what was the question you put to the ofﬁcer at the gate we asked him where is he that is born king of the i see now why the people were so curious you excite less is there another king of the jews the egyptian did not blanch there is one newly an expression of pain knit the dark face of the monarch if his mind were swept by harrowing recollection not to not to he exclaimed possibly the accusing images of his murdered children ﬂitted before him recovering from the emotion whatever it was he asked steadily where is the new king that king is what we would you bring riddle surpassing any of solomon s the inquisitor said next you see i am in the time of life when curiosity is ungovernable it was in childhood when to triﬂe with it is cruelty tell further and i will honor you kings honor each other give all you know about the newly born and i will join you in the search him and when we have found him i will what you wish i will bring him to jerusalem and train him in kingcraft i will use my grace with cæsar his promotion and glory jealousy shall not come between us so i swear but tell ﬁrst how so widely separated by seas and deserts you all came to hear of i will tell you truly speak on said herod balthasar raised himself erect and said solemnly there is an almighty herod was visibly startled he bade us come hither promising that we should ﬁnd the redeemer of the world that we should see and worship him and bear witness that he was come and sign we were each project gutenberg https see star his spirit stayed with us king his spirit is with us now an overpowering feeling seized the three the greek with difﬁculty restrained an outcry herod s gaze darted quickly from one to the other he was more suspicious and dissatisﬁed than before you are mocking he said if not tell more what is to follow the coming of the new king the salvation of from what their how by the divine love and good then paused and from his look man could have said with what feeling he you are the heralds of the christ is that all balthasar bowed low we are your servants the monarch touched bell and the attendant appeared bring the gifts the master said the attendant went out but in little while returned and kneeling before the guests gave to each one an outer robe or mantle of scarlet and blue and girdle of gold they acknowledged the honors with eastern prostrations word further said herod when the ceremony was ended to the ofﬁcer of the gate and but now to you spoke of seeing star in the yes said balthasar his star the star of the newly what time did it appear when we were bidden come hither herod arose signifying the audience was over stepping from the throne towards them he said with all graciousness if i believe illustrious men you are indeed the heralds of the christ just born know that i have this night consulted those wisest in things jewish and they say with one voice he should be born in bethlehem of judea i say to you go thither go and search diligently the young child and when you have found him bring word again that i may come and worship him to your going there shall be let or hindrance peace be with you and folding his robe about him he left the chamber directly the guide came and led them back to the street and thence to the khan at the portal of which the greek said impulsively let us to bethlehem brethren the king has yes cried the hindoo the spirit burns within be it so said balthasar with equal warmth the camels are ready they gave gifts to the steward mounted into their saddles received directions to the joppa gate and departed at their approach the great valves were unbarred and they passed out into the open country taking the road so lately travelled by joseph and mary they came up out of hinnom on the plain of rephaim project gutenberg https appeared at ﬁrst and faint their pulses ﬂuttered fast the light intensiﬁed rapidly they closed their eyes against its burning brilliance when they dared look again lo the star perfect any in the heavens but low down and moving slowly before them and they folded their hands and shouted and rejoiced with exceeding great joy god is with us god is with us they repeated in frequent cheer all the way until the star rising out of the valley beyond mar elias stood still over house up on the slope of the hill near the project gutenberg https xiv it was now the beginning of the third watch and at bethlehem the morning was breaking over the mountains in the east but so feebly that it was yet night in the valley the watchman on the roof of the old khan shivering in the chilly air was listening the ﬁrst distinguishable sounds with which life awakening greets the dawn when light came moving up the hill towards the house he thought it torch in some one s hand next moment he thought it meteor the brilliance grew however until it became star sore afraid he cried out and brought everybody within the walls to the roof the phenomenon in eccentric motion continued to approach the rocks trees and roadway under it shone in glare of lightning directly its brightness became blinding the more timid of the beholders fell upon their knees and prayed with their faces hidden the boldest covering their eyes crouched and now and then snatched glances fearfully afterwhile the khan and everything thereabout lay under the intolerable radiance such dared look beheld the star standing still directly over the house in front of the cave where the child had been born in the height of this scene the wise men came up and at the gate dismounted from their camels and shouted admission when the steward so far mastered his terror to give them heed he drew the bars and opened to them the camels looked spectral in the unnatural light and besides their outlandishness there were in the faces and manner of the three visitors an eagerness and exaltation which still further excited the keeper s fears and fancy he fell back and time could not answer the question they put to him is not this bethlehem of judea but others came and by their presence gave him assurance this is but the khan the town lies farther is there not here child newly born the bystanders turned to each other marvelling though some of them answered y es show us to him said the greek impatiently show us to him cried balthasar breaking through his gravity we have seen his star even that which ye behold over the house and are come to worship the hindoo clasped his hands exclaiming god indeed lives make haste make haste the savior is found blessed blessed are we above men the people from the roof came down and followed the strangers they were taken through the court and out into the enclosure at sight of the star yet above the cave though less candescent than before some turned back afraid the greater part went on the strangers neared the house the orb arose when they were at the door it was high up overhead vanishing when they entered it went out lost to sight and to the witnesses of what then took place came conviction that there was divine relation between the star and the strangers which extended also to at least some of project gutenberg https of the cave when the door was opened they crowded in the apartment was lighted by lantern enough to enable the strangers to ﬁnd the mother and the child awake in her lap is the child thine asked balthasar of mary and she who had kept all the things in the least affecting the little one and pondered them in her heart held it up in the light saying he is my son and they fell down and worshipped him they saw the child was other child ren about its head was neither nimbus nor material crown its lips opened not in speech if it heard their expressions of joy their invocations their prayers it made sign whatever but looked longer at the ﬂame in the lantern than at them in little while they arose and returnin g to the camels brought gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh and laid them before the child abating nothing of their worship ful speeches of which part is given the thoughtful know that the pure worship of the pure heart was then what it is now and has always been an inspired song and this was the savior they had come so far to ﬁnd yet they worshipped without doubt why their faith rested upon the signs sent them by him whom we have since come to know the father and they were of the kind to whom his promises were so that they asked nothing about his ways few there were who had seen the signs and heard the mother and joseph the shepherds and the they all believed alike that is to say in this period of the plan of salvation god was all and the child nothing but look forward reader time will come when the signs will all proceed from the son happy they who then believe in him let us wait that project gutenberg https second there is ﬁre and motion of the soul which will not dwell in its own narrow being but aspire beyond the ﬁtting medium of desire and but once kindled quenchless evermore preys upon high adventure nor can tire of aught but childe project gutenberg https i it is necessary now to carry the reader forward years to the beginning of the administration of valerius gratus the fourth imperial governor of period which will be remembered rent by political agitations in jerusalem if indeed it be not the precise time of the opening of the ﬁnal quarrel between the jew and the roman in the interval judea had been subjected to changes affecting her in many ways but in nothing so much her political status herod the great died within one year after the birth of the so miserably that the christian world had reason to believe him overtaken by the divine wrath like all great rulers who spend their lives in perfecting the power they create he dreamed of transmitting his throne and being the founder of dynasty with that intent he left will dividing his territories between his three sons antipas philip and archelaus of whom the last was appointed to succeed to the title the testament was necessarily referred to augustus the emperor who ratiﬁed all its provisions with one exception he withheld from archelaus the title of king until he proved his capacity and loyalty in lieu thereof he created him ethnarch and such permitted him to govern nine years when miscondu ct and inability to stay the turbulent elements that grew and streng thened around him he was sent into gaul an exile cæsar was not content with deposing archelaus he struck the people of jerusalem in manner that touched their pride and keenly wounded the sensibilities of the haughty habitues of the temple he reduced judea to roman province and annexed it to the prefecture of syria so instead of king ruling royally from the palace left by herod on mount zion the city fell into the hands of an ofﬁcer of the second grade an appointee called procurator who communicated with the court in rome through the legate of syria residing in antioch to make the hurt more painful the procurator was not permitted to establish himself in jerusalem cæsarea was his seat of government most humiliating however most exasperating most studied samaria of all the world the most was joined to judea part of the same province what ineffable misery the bigoted separatists or pharisees endured at ﬁnding themselves elbowed and laughed at in the procurator s presence in cæsarea by the devotees of gerizim in this rain of sorrows one consolation and one only remained to the fallen people the occupied the herodian palace in the and kept the semblance of court there what his authority really was is matter of easy estimate judgment of life and death was retained by the procurator justice was administered in the name and according to the decretals of rome yet more signiﬁcant the royal house was jointly occupied by the imperial exciseman and all his corps of assistants registrars collectors publicans informers and spies still to the dreamers of liberty to come there was certain satisfaction in the fact that the chief ruler in the palace was jew his mere presence there project gutenberg https day kept them reminded of the covenants and promises of the prophets and the ages when jehovah governed the tribes through the sons of aaron it was to them certain sign that he had not abandoned them so their hopes lived and served their patience and helped them wait grimly the son of judah who was to rule israel judea had been roman province eighty years and ample time the cæsars to study the idiosyncrasies of the people enough at least to learn that the jew with all his pride could be quietly governed if his religion were respected proceeding upon that policy the predecessors of gratus had carefully abstained from interfering with any of the sacred observances of their subjects but he chose different course almost his ﬁrst ofﬁcial act was to expel hannas from the priesthood and give the place to ishmael son of fabus whether the act was directed by augustus or proceeded from gratus himself its impolicy became speedily apparent the reader shall be spared chapter on jewish politics few words upon the subject however are essential to such may follow the succeeding narration critically at this time leaving origin out of view there were in judea the party of the nobles and the separatist or popular party upon herod s death the two united against archelaus from temple to palace from jerusalem to rome they fought him sometimes with intrigue sometimes with the actual weapons of war more than once the holy cloisters on moriah resounded with the cries of finally they drove him into exile meantime throughout this struggle the allies had their diverse objects in view the nobles hated joazar the the separatists on the other hand were his zealous adherents when herod s settlement went down with archelaus joazar shared the fall hannas the son of seth was selected by the nobles to ﬁll the great ofﬁce thereupon the allies divided the induction of the sethian brought them face to face in ﬁerce hostility in the course of the struggle with the unfortunate ethnarch the nobles had found it expedient to attach themselves to rome discerning that when the existing settlement was broken up some form of government must needs follow they suggested the conversion of judea into province the fact furnished the separatists an additional cause attack and when samaria was made part of the province the nobles sank into minority with nothing to support them but the imperial court and the prestige of their rank and wealth yet ﬁfteen indeed to the coming of valerius managed to maintain themselves in both palace and temple hannas the idol of his party had used his power faithfully in the interest of his imperial patron roman garrison held the tower of antonia roman guard kept the gates of the palace roman judge dispensed justice civil and criminal roman system of taxation mercilessly executed crushe d both city and country daily hourly and in thousand ways the people were bruised and galled and taught the difference betwe en life of independence and life of subjection yet hannas kept them in comparative quiet rome had truer friend and he made his loss instantly felt delivering his vestments to ishmael the new appointee he walked from the courts of the temple into the councils of the separatists and became the head of new combination bethusian and project gutenberg https the procurator left thus withou t party saw the ﬁres which in the ﬁfteen years had sunk into sodden smoke begin to glow with returning life month after ishmael took the ofﬁce the roman found it necessary to visit him in jerusalem when from the walls hooting and hissing him the jews beheld his guard enter the north gate of the city and march to the tower of antonia they understood the real purpose of the full cohort of legionaries was added to the former garrison and the keys of their yoke could now be tightened with impunity if the procurator deemed it important to make an example alas the ﬁrst offender project gutenberg https ii with the foregoing explanation in mind the reader is invited to look into one of the gardens of the palace on mount zion the time was noonday in the middle of july when the heat of summer was at its highest the garden was bounded on every side by buildings which in places arose two stories with verandas shading the doors and windows of the lower story while retreating galleries guarded by strong balustrades adorned and protected the upper here and there moreover the structures fell into what appeared low colonnades permitting the passage of such winds chanced to blow and allowing other parts of the house to be seen the better to realize its magnitude and beauty the arrangement of the ground was equally pleasant to the eye there were walks and patches of grass and shrubbery and few large trees rare specimens of the palm grouped with the carob apricot and walnut in all directions the grade sloped gently from the centre where there was reservoir or deep marble basin broken at intervals by little gates which when raised emptied the water into sluices bordering the cunning device the rescue of the place from the aridity too prevalent elsewhere in the region not far from the fountain there was small pool of clear water nourishing clump of cane and oleander such grow on the jordan and down by the dead sea between the clump and the pool unmindful of the sun shining full upon them in the breathless air two boys one about nineteen the other seventeen sat engaged in earnest conversation they were both handsome and at ﬁrst glance would have been pronounced brothers both had hair and eyes black their faces were deeply browned and sitting they seemed of size proper the dif ference in their ages the elder was bareheaded loose tunic dropping to the knees was his attire complete except sandal s and mantle spread under him on the seat the costume left his arms and legs exposed and they were brown the face nevertheless certain grace of manner reﬁnement of featu res and culture of voice decided his rank the tunic of softest woollen at the neck sleeves and edge of the skirt bordered with red and bound to the waist by tasselled silken cord certiﬁed him the roman he was and if in speech he now and then gazed haughtily at his companion and addressed him an inferior he might almost be excused he was of family noble even in circumstance which in that age justiﬁed any assumption in the terrible wars between the ﬁrst cæsar and his great enemies messala had been the friend of brutus after philippi without sacriﬁce of his honor he and the conque ror became reconciled yet later when octavius disputed the empire messala supported him octavius the emperor augustus remembered the service and showered the family with honors among other things judea being reduced to province he sent the son of his old client or retainer to jerusalem charged with the receipt and management project gutenberg https taxes levied in that region and in that service the son had since remained sharing the palace with the the youth just described was his son whose habit it was to carry about with him all too faithfully remembrance of the relation between his grandfather and the great romans of his day the associate of the messala was slighter in form and his garments were of ﬁne white linen and of the prevalent style in jerusalem cloth covered his head held by yellow cord and arranged so to fall away from the forehead down low over the back of the neck an observer skilled in the distinctions of race and studying his features more than his costume would have soon discovered him to be of jewish descent the forehead of the roman was high and narrow his nose sharp and aquiline while his lips were thin and straight and his eyes cold and close under the brows the front of the israelite on the other hand was low and broad his nose long with expanded nostrils his upper lip slightly shading the lower one short and curving to the dimpled corners like cupid s bow points which in connection with the round chin full eyes and oval cheeks reddened with glow gave his face the softness strength and beauty peculiar to his race the comeliness of the roman was severe and chaste that of the jew rich and voluptuous did you not say the new procurator is to arrive the question proceeded from the younger of the friends and was couched in greek at the time singu larly enough the language everywhere prevalent in the politer circles of judea having passed from the palace into the camp and college thence nobody knew exactly when or how into the temple itself and that matter into precincts of the temple far beyond the gates and precincts of sanctity intolerable gentile yes messala answered who told you i heard ishmael the new governor in the call him high my father so last night the news had been more credible i grant you coming from an egyptian who is of race that has forgotten what truth is or even from an idumaean whose people never knew what truth was but to make quite certain i saw centurion from the tower this morning and he told preparations were going on the reception that the armorers were furbishing the helmets and shields and regilding the eagles and globes and that apartments long unused were being cleansed and aired if an addition to the probably of the great perfect idea of the manner in which the answer was given can not be conveyed its ﬁne points continually escape the power behind the pen the reader s fancy must come to his aid and that he must be reminded that reverence quality of the roman mind was fast breaking down or rather it was becoming unfashionable the old religion had nearly ceased to be faith at most it was mere habit of thought and expression cherished principally by the priests who found service in the temple proﬁtable and the poets who in the turn of their verses could not dispense with the familiar deities there are singers of this age who are similarly given philosophy was taking the place of religion satire was fast substituting reverence insomuch that in latin opinion it was to every speech even to the little diatribes project gutenberg https salt to viands and aroma to wine the young messala educated in rome but lately returned had caught the habit and manner the scarce perceptible movement of the outer corner of the lower eyelid the decided curl of the corresponding nostril and languid utterance affected the best vehicle to convey the idea of general indifference but more particularly because of the opportunities it afforded certain rhetorical pauses thought to be of prime importance to enable the listener to take the happy conceit or receive the virus of the stinging epigram such stop occurred in the answer just given at the end of the allusion to the egyptian and idumaean the color in the jewish lad s cheeks deepened and he may not have heard the rest of the speech he remained silent looking absently into the depths of the pool our farewell took place in this garden the peace of the lord go with you last words the gods keep you i said you remember how many years have passed since then five answered the jew gazing into the water well you have reason to be thankful shall i say the gods matter you have grown handsome the greeks would call you achievement of the years if jupiter would stay content with one ganymede what you would make the emperor tell my judah how the coming of the procurator is of such interest to judah bent his large eyes upon the questioner the gaze was grave and thoughtful and caught the roman s and held it while he replied yes ﬁve years i remember the parting you went to rome i saw you start and cried i love you the years are gone and you have come back to accomplished and i not jest and wish you were the messala you went away the ﬁne nostril of the satirist stirred and he put on longer drawl he said not oracle my judah few lessons from my teacher of rhetoric hard by the will give you letter to him when you become wise enough to accept suggestion which i am reminded to make little practise of the art of mystery and delphi will receive you apollo himself at the sound of your solemn voice the pythia will come down to you with her crown serio usly my friend in what am i not the messala i went away i once heard the greatest logician in the world his subject was disputation one saying i understand your antagonist before you answer let understand the lad reddened under the cynical look to which he was subjected yet he replied ﬁrmly you have availed yourself i see of your opportunities from your teachers you have brought away much knowledge and many graces you talk with the ease of master yet your speech carries sting my messala when he went away had poison in his nature not the world would he have hurt the feelings of the roman smiled if complimented and raised his patrician head toss higher my solemn judah we are not at dodona or pytho drop the oracular and be plain wherein have i hurt you the other drew long breath and said pulling at the cord about his waist in the ﬁve years i too have learned somewhat project gutenberg https not be the equal of the logician you heard and simeon and shammai are doubt inferior to your master hard by the forum their learning goes not out into forbidden paths those who sit at their feet arise enriched simply with knowledge of god the law and israel and the effect is love and reverence everything that pertains to them attendance at the great college and study of what i heard there have taught that judea is not she used to be i know the space that lies between an independent kingdom and the petty province judea is i were meaner viler than samaritan not to resent the degradation of my country ishmael is not lawfully and he can not be while the noble hannas lives yet he is levite one of the devoted who thousands of years have acceptably served the lord god of our faith and worship messala broke in upon him with biting laugh oh i understand you now ishmael you say is usurper yet to believe an idumaean sooner than ishma el is to sting like an adder by the drunken son of semele what it is to be jew all men and things even heaven and earth change but jew never to him there is backward forward he is what his ancestor was in the beginning in this sand i draw you now tell what more jew s life is round and round abraham here isaac and jacob yonder god in the middle and the the master of all thunders the circle is too large i draw it he stopped put his thumb upon the ground and swept the ﬁngers about it see the thumb spot is the temple the ﬁnger judea outside the little space is there nothing of value the arts herod was builder therefore he is accursed painting sculpture to look upon them is sin

public resorts of rome almost monopolizing the business of teaching her patrician youth might have approved these sayings of messala they were all in the popular vein to the young jew however they were new and unlike the solemn style of discourse and conversation to which he was accustomed he belon ged moreover to race whose laws modes and habits of thought forbade satire and humor very naturally therefore he listened to his friend with varying feelings one moment indignant then uncertain how to take him the superior airs assumed had been offensive to him in the beginning soon they became irritating and at last an acute smart anger lies close by this point in all of us and that the satirist evoked in another way to the jew of the herodian period patriotism was savage passion scarcely hidden under his common humor and so related to his history religion and god that it responded instantly to derision of them wherefore it is not speaking too strongly to say that messala s progress down to the last pause was exquisite torture to his hearer at that point the latter said with forced smile there are few i have heard who can afford to make jest of their future you convince my messala that i am not one of the roman studied him then replied why not the truth in jest well parable the great fulvia went ﬁshing the other day she caught more than all the company besides they

hand used to walk when we were children let us keep it far the apparently messala was trying to be serious and kind though he could not rid his countenance of the habitual satirical expression judah permitted the familiarity you are boy i am man let talk like the complacency of the roman was superb mentor lecturing the young telemachus could not have been more at ease you believe in the parcae ah i forgot you are sadducee the essenes are your sensible people they believe in the sisters so how everlastingly the three are in the way of our doing what we please i sit down scheming i run paths

spoke of succeeding old cyrenius you thought i meant to enrich myself plundering your judea suppose so it is what some roman will why not i judah shortened his step there have been strangers in mastery of judea before the roman he said with lifted hand where are they messala she has outlived them all what has been will be messala put on his drawl the parcae have believers outside the essenes welcome judah welcome to the faith messala count not with them my faith rests on the rock which was the foundation of the faith of my fathers back further than abraham on the covenants of the lord god

hand gently from his shoulder and confronted messala tears trembling in his eyes i understand you because you are roman you can not understand am an israelite you have given suffering day by

the edge of which all around the square was deﬁned by sculptured cornice and parapet of tiling sexangular and bright red in this quarter moreover there was everywhere observable scrupulous neatness

had he been stranger he might have bestowed glance upon the structure he drew nigh it and seen all the dimness darkened mass low latticed pillared and domed he entered passing under curtain the interior was all darkness except that on four sides there were arched openings like doorways through which the sky lighted with stars was visible in one of the openings reclining against cushion from divan he saw the ﬁgure of woman indistinct even in white ﬂoating drapery at the sound of his steps upon the ﬂoor the fan in her hand stopped glistening where the starlight struck the jewels with which it was sprinkled and she sat up and called his name judah my son it is i mother he answered quickening his approach going to her he knelt and she put her arms around him and with kisses pressed him to

to be my she spoke in the language almost lost in the land but which they were always rich in blood in cherished in its purity that they might be more certainly distinguished from gentile language in which the loved rebekah and rachel sang to benjamin the words appeared to set him thinking anew after while however he caught the hand with which she fanned him and said today my mother i have been made to think of many things that never had place in my mind before tell ﬁrst what am i to be have i not told you you are to be my he could not see her face yet he knew she was in play he became more serious you are very good very kind my mother one will ever love you he kissed the hand over and over again i think i understand why you would have put off the question he continued thus far my life has belonged to you how gentle how sweet your control has been i wish it could last forever but that may not be it is the lord s will that i shall one day become owner of day of separation and therefore dreadful day to you let us be brave and serious i will be your hero but you must put in the way you know the son of israel must have some occupation i am not exempt and ask now shall i tend the herds or till the soil or drive the saw or be clerk or lawyer what shall i be dear good mother help to an answer gamaliel has been lecturing today she said thoughtfully if so i did not hear then you have been walking with simeon who they tell inherits the genius of his family i have not seen him i have been up on the not to the temple i visited the young certain change in his voice attracted the mother s attention presentiment quickened the beating of her heart the fan became motionless again the messala she said what could he say to so trouble you project gutenberg https he is very much you mean he has come back roman she continued half to hersel to all the world the word means master how long has he been away five she raised her head and looked of f into the night the airs of the via sacra are well enough in the streets of the egyptian and in babylon but in covenant and full of the thought she settled back into her easy place he was ﬁrst to speak what messala said my mother was sharp enough in itself but taken with the manner some of the sayings were i think i understand you rome her poets orators senators courtiers are mad with af fectation of what they call i suppose all great peoples are proud he went on scarcely noticing the interruption but the pride of that people is unlike all others in these latter days it is so grown the gods barely escape the gods escape said the mother quickly more than one roman has accepted worship his divine well messala always had his share of the disagreeable quality when he was child i have seen him mock strangers whom even herod condescended to receive with honors yet he always spared judea the ﬁrst time in conversation with he triﬂed with our customs and god you would have had i parted with him ﬁnally and now my dear mother i would know with more certainty if there be just ground the roman s contempt in what am i his inferior is ours lower order of people why should i even in cæsar s presence feel the shrinking of slave tell especially why if i have the soul and so choose i may not hunt the honors of the world in all its ﬁelds why may not i take sword and indulge the passion of war poet why may not i sing of all themes i can be worker in metals keeper of ﬂocks merchant why not an artist like the greek tell my this is the sum of my may not son of israel all roman may the reader will refer these questions back to the conversation in the the mother listening with all her faculties awake from something which would have been lost upon one less interested in the connections of the subject the pointing of the questions possibly his accent and not less swift in making the same reference she sat up and in voice quick and sharp his own replied i see i see from association messala in boyhood was almost jew had he remained here he might have become proselyte so much we all borrow from the inﬂuences that ripen our lives but the years in rome have been too much him i not wonder at the change yet voice he might have dealt tenderly at least with you it is hard cruel nature which in youth can get its ﬁrst her hand dropped lightly upon his forehead and the ﬁngers caught in his hair and lingered there lovingly while her eyes sought the highest stars in view her pride responded to his not merely in echo but in the unison of perfect sympathy she would answer him at the same time not the world would she project gutenberg https the answer unsatisfactory an admission of inferiority might weaken his spirit life she faltered with misgivings of her own powers what you propose my judah is not subject treatment by woman let put its consideration off till and i will have the wise not send to the rector he said abruptly i will have him come to i seek more than information while he might give that better than you my mother you can better by giving what he can not resolution which is the soul of man s she swept the heavens with rapid glance trying to compass all the meaning of his questions while craving justice ourselves it is never wise to be unjust to others to deny valor in the enemy we have conquered is to underrate our victory and if the enemy be strong enough to hold us at bay much more to conquer us bids us seek some other explanation of our misfortunes than accusing him of qualities inferior to our thus speaking to herself rather than to him she began take heart my son the messala is nobly descended his family has been illustrious through many generations in the days of republican far back i can not were famous some soldiers some civilians i can recall but one consul of the name their rank was senatorial and their patronage always sought because they were alwa ys rich yet if your friend boasted of his ancestry you might have shamed him by recounting yours if he referred to the ages through which the line is traceable or to deeds rank or weal allusions except when great occasion demands them are tokens of small he mentioned them in proof of his superiority then without dread and standing on each particular you might have challenged him to comparison of taking moment s thought the mother proceeded one of the ideas of fast hold now is that time has much to with the nobility of races and families roman boasting his superiority on that account over son of israel will always fail when put to the proof the founding of rome was his beginning the very best of them can not trace their descent beyond that period few of them pretend to so and of such i say not one could make good his claim except by resort to tradition messala certainly could not let us look now to ourselves could we better little more light would have enabled him to see the pride that diffused itself over her face let us imagine the roman putting us to the challenge i would answer him neither doubting nor her voice faltered tender thought changed the form of the argument your father my judah is at rest with his fathers yet i remember though it were this evening the day he and i with many rejoicing friends went up into the temple to present you to the lord we sacriﬁced the doves and to the priest i gave your name which he wrote in my judah son of ithamar project gutenberg https house of the name was then carried away and written in book of the division of records devoted to the saintly family i can not tell you when the custom of registration in this mode began we know it prevailed before the ﬂight from egypt i have heard hillel say abraham caused the record to be ﬁrst opened with his own name and the names of his sons moved by the promises of the lord which separated him and them from all other races and made them the highest and noblest the very chosen of the earth the covenant with jacob was of like effect in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed said the angel to abraham in the place and the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed the lord himself said to jacob asleep at bethel on the way to haran afterwards the wise men looked forward to just division of the land of promise and that it might be known in the day of partition who were entitled to portions the book of generations was begun but not that alone the promise of blessing to all the earth through the patriarch reached far into the future one name was mentioned in connection with the benefactor might be the humblest of the chosen family the lord our god knows distinctions of rank or riches so to make the performance clear to men of the generation who were to witness it and that they might give the glory to whom it belonged the record was required to be kept with absolute certainty has it been so kept the fan played to and fro until becoming impatient he repeated the question is the record absolutely true hillel said it was and of all who have lived one was so upon the subject our people have at times been heedless of some parts of the law but never of this part the good rector himself has followed the books of generations through three the promises to the opening of the temple thence to the captivity thence again to the present once only were the records disturbed and that was at the end of the second period but when the nation returned from the long exile ﬁrst duty to god zerubbabel restored the books enabling us once more to carry the lines of jewish descent back unbroken fully two thousand years and she paused if to allow the hearer to measure the time comprehended in the statement and now she continued what becomes of the roman boast of blood enriched by ages by that test the sons of israel watching the herds on old rephaim yonder are nobler than the noblest of the and i the books who am i what i have said thus far my son had reference to your question i will answer you if messala were here he might say others have said that the exact trace of your lineage stopped when the assyrian took jerusalem and razed the temple with all its precious stores but you might plead the pious action of zerubbabel and retort that all verity in roman genealogy ended when the barbarians from the west took rome and camped six months upon her desolated site did the government keep family histories if so what became of them in those dreadful days there is verity in our books of generations and following them back to the captivity back to the foundation of the ﬁrst temple back to the march from egypt we have project gutenberg https that you are lineally sprung from hur the associate of joshua in the matter of descent sanctiﬁed by time is not the honor perfect you care to pursue further if so take the torah and search the book of numbers and of the generations after adam you can ﬁnd the very progenitor of your there was silence time in the chamber on the roof i thank you my mother judah next said clasping both her hands in his i thank you with all my heart i was right in not having the good rector called in he could not have satisﬁed more than you have yet to make family truly noble is time alone sufﬁcient ah you forget you forget our claim rests not merely upon time the lord s preference is our especial glory you are speaking of the race and i mother of the family in the years since father abraham what have they achieved what have they done wha t great things to lift them above the level of their fellows she hesitated thinking she might all this time have mistaken his object the information he sought migh t have been more than satisfaction of wounded vanity youth is but the painted shell within which continually growing lives that wondrous thing the spirit of man biding its moment of appa rition earlier in some than in others she trembled under perception that this might be the supreme moment come to him that children at birth reach out their untried hands grasping shadow s and crying the while so his spirit might in temporary blindness be struggling to take hold of its impalpable future they to whom boy comes asking who am i and what am i to be have need of ever so much care each word in answer may prove to the what each ﬁnger of the artist is to the clay he is modelling i have feeling my judah she said patting his cheek with the hand he had been i have the feeling that all i have said has been in strife with an antagonis t more real than imaginary if messala is the enemy not leave to ﬁght him in the dark tell all he project gutenberg https v the young israelite proceeded then and rehearsed his conversation with messala dwelling with particularity upon the latter s speeches in contempt of the jews their customs and much pent round of life afraid to speak the while the mother listened discerning the matter plainly judah had gone to the palace on the allured by love of playmate whom he thought to ﬁnd exactly he had been at the parting years before man met him and in place of laughter and references to the sports of the past the man had been full of the future and talked of glory to be won and of riches and power unconscious of the effect the visitor had come away hurt in pride yet touched with natural ambition but she the jealous mother saw it and not knowing the turn the aspiration might take became at once jewish in her fear what if it lured him away from the patriarchal faith in her view that consequence was more dreadful than any or all others she could discover but one way to avert it and she set about the task her native power reinforced by love to such degree that her speech took masculine strength and at times poet s fervor there never has been people she began who did not think themselves at least equal to any other never great nation my son that did not believe itself the very superior when the roman looks down upon israel and laughs he merely repeats the folly of the egyptian the assyrian and the macedonian and the laugh is against god the result will be the her voice became ﬁrmer there is law by which to determine the superiority of nations hence the vanity of the claim and the idleness of disputes about it people risen run their race and die either of themselves or at the hands of another who succe eding to their power take possession of their place and upon their monuments write new names such is history if i were called upon to symbolize god and man in the simplest form i would draw straight line and circle and of the line i would say this is god he alone moves forever straightforward and of the circle this is is his i not mean that there is difference between the careers of nations two are alike the difference however is not some say in the extent of the circle they describe or the space of earth they cover but in the sphere of their movement the highest being nearest god to stop here my son would be to leave the subject where we began let us go on there are signs by which to measure the height of the circle each nation runs while in its course by them let us compare the hebrew and the roman the simplest of all the signs is the daily life of the people of this i will only say israel has at times forgotten god while the roman never knew him consequently comparison is not possible your your former ged if i understood you rightly that we have had poets artists or warriors project gutenberg https he meant i suppose to deny that we have had great men the next most certain of the signs just consideration of this charge requires deﬁnition at the commencement great man my boy is one whose life proves him to have been recognized if not called by god persian was used to punish our recreant fathers and he carried them into captivity another persian was selected to restore their children to the holy land greater than either of them however was the macedonian through whom the desolation of judea and the temple was avenged the special distinction of the men was that they were chosen by the lord each divine purpose and that they were gentiles does not lessen their glory not lose sight of this deﬁnition while i proceed there is an idea that war is the most noble occupation of men and that the most exalted greatness is the growth of because the world has adopted the idea be not you deceived that we must worship something is law which will continue long there is anything we can not unders tand the prayer of the barbarian is wail of fear addressed to strength the only divine quality he can clearly conceive hence his faith in heroes what is jove but roman hero the greeks have their great glory because they were the ﬁrst to set mind above strength in athens the orator and philosopher were more revered than the warrior the charioteer and the swiftest runner are still idols of the arena yet the immortelles are reserved the sweetest singer the birthplace of one poet was contested by seven cities but was the hellene the ﬁrst to deny the old barbaric faith my son that glory is ours against brutalism our fathers erected god in our worship the wail of fear gave place to the hosanna and the psalm so the hebrew and the greek would have carried all humanity forward and upward but alas the government of the world presumes war an eternal condition wherefore over mind and above god the roman has enthroned his cæsar the absorbent of all attainable power the prohibition of any other greatness the sway of the greek was ﬂower ing time genius in return the liberty it then enjoyed what company of thinkers the mind led forth there was glory every excellence and perfection so absolute that in everything but war even the roman has stooped to imitation greek is now the model of the orators in the forum listen and in every rom an song you will hear the rhythm of the greek if roman opens his mouth speaking wisely of moralities or abstractions or of the mysteries of nature he is either plagiarist or the disciple of some school which had greek its founder in nothing but war i say again has rome claim to originality her games and spectacles are greek inventions dashed with blood to gratify the ferocity of her rabble her religion if such it may be called is made up of contributions from the faiths of all other peoples her most venerated gods are from even her mars and that matter the jove she much magniﬁes so it happens my son that of the whole world our israel alone can dispute the superiority of the greek and with him contest the palm of original genius to the excellences of other peoples the egotism of roman is blindfold impenetrable his breastplate oh the ruthless robbers under their trampling the earth trembles like ﬂoor beaten with ﬂails along with the rest we are alas that i should say it to you my son they have our highest places and the holiest and the end man can tell but this i may reduce judea project gutenberg https broken with hammers and devo ur jerusalem which is the oil and sweetness thereof yet the glory of the men of israel will remain light in the heavens overhead out of reach their history is the history of god who wrote with their hands spake with their tongues and was himself in all the good they did even the least who dwelt with them lawgiver on sinai guide in the wilderness in war captain in government king who once and again pushed back the curtains of the pavilion which is his intolerably bright and man speaking to men showed them the right and the way to happiness and how they should live and made them promises binding the strength of his almightiness with covenants sworn to everlastingly my son could it be that they with whom jehovah thus dwelt an awful familiar derived nothing from him in their lives and deeds the common human qualities should not in some degree have been mixed and colored with the divine that their genius should not have in it even after the lapse of ages some little of heaven time the rustling of the fan was all the sound heard in the chamber in the sense which limits art to sculp ture and painting it is true she next said israel has had the admission was made regretfully it must be remembered she was sadducee whose faith unlike that of the pharisees permitted love of the beautiful in every form and without reference to its origin still he who would justice she proceeded will not forget that the cunning of our hands was bound by the prohibition thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything which the sopherim wickedly extended beyond its purpose and time nor should it be forgotten that long before dædalus appeared in attica and with his wooden statues so transformed sculpture to make possible the schools of corinth and ægina and their ultimate triumphs the poecile and

springing from the divan and running out in moment more he was leaning over the parapet of tiles which guarded the roof at the extreme northeast corner so absorbed project gutenberg https did not notice tirzah by his side resting one hand upon his shoulder their roof being the highest one in the commanded the eastward far the huge irregular tower of antonia which has been already mentioned citadel the garrison and military headquarters the governor the street not more than ten feet wide was spanned here and there by bridges open and covered which like the roofs along the way were beginning to be occupied by men women and children called out by the music the word is used though it is hardly ﬁtting what the people heard when they came forth was rather an uproar of trumpets and the shriller litui so delightful to the soldiers the array after while came into view of the two upon the house of the hurs first vanguard of the slingers and with wide intervals between their ranks and ﬁles next body of med infantry bearing large shields and hastoe longoe or spears identical with those used in the duels before ilium then the musicians and then an ofﬁcer riding alone but followed closely by guard of cavalry after them again column of infantry also which moving in close order crowded the streets from wall to wall and appeared to be without end the brawny limbs of the men the cadenced motion from right to left of the shields the sparkle of scales buckles and breastplates and helms all perfectly burnished the plumes nodding above the tall crests the sway of ensigns and spears the bold conﬁdent step exactly timed and measured the demeanor so grave yet so watchful the unity of the whole moving an impression upon judah but something felt rather than seen two objects ﬁxed his the eagle of the legion gilded efﬁgy perched on tall shaft with wings outspread until they met above its head he knew that when brought from its chamber in the tower it had been received with divine honors the ofﬁcer riding alone in the midst of the column was the other attraction his head was bare otherwis he was in full armor at his left hip he wore short sword in his hand however he carried truncheon which looked like roll of white paper he sat upon purple cloth instead of saddle and that and bridle with forestall of gold and reins of yellow silk broadly fringed at the lower edge completed the housings of the horse while the man was yet in the distance judah observed that his presence was sufﬁcient to throw the people looking at him into angry excitement they would lean over the parapets or stand boldly out and shake their ﬁsts at him they followed him with loud cries and spit at him he passed under the bridges the women even ﬂung their sandals someti mes with such good effect to hit him when he was nearer the yells became robber tyrant dog of roman away with ishmael give us back our hannas when quite near judah could see that was but natural the man did not share the indifference so superbly shown by the soldiers his face was dark and sullen and the glances he occasionally cast at his persecutors were full of menace the very timid shrank from project gutenberg https the lad had heard of the custom borrowed from habit of the ﬁrst cæsar by which chief commanders to indicate their rank appeared in public with only laurel vine upon their heads by that sign he knew this alerius gra tus the new procura tor of judea to say truth now the roman under the unprovoked storm had the young jew s sympathy so that when he reached the corner of the house the latter leaned yet farther over the parapet to see him go by and in the act rested hand upon tile which had been long time cracked and allowed to go unnoticed the pressure was strong enough to displace the outer piece which started to fall thrill of horror shot through the youth he reached out to catch the missile in appearance the motion was exactly that of one pitching something from him the effort it served to push the descending fragment farther out over the wall he shouted with all his might the soldiers of the guard looked up so did the great man and that moment the missile struck him and he fell from his seat dead the cohort halted the guards leaped from their horses and hastened to cover the chief with their shields on the other hand the people who witnessed the affair never doubting that the blow had been purposely dealt cheered the lad he yet stooped in full view over the parapet transﬁxed by what he beheld and by anticipation of the consequences ﬂashed all too plainly upon him mischievous spirit ﬂew with incredible speed from roof to roof along the line of march seizing the people and urging them all alike they laid hands upon the parapets and tore up the tiling and the sunburnt mud of which the were the most part made and with blind fury began to ﬂing them upon the legionaries halted below battle then ensued discipline of course prevailed the struggle the slaughter the skill of one side the desperation of the other are alike unnecessary to our story let us look rather to the wretched author of it all he arose from the parapet his face very pale tirzah tirzah what will become of us she had not seen the occurrence below but was listening to the shouting and watching the mad activity of the people in view on the houses something terrible was going on she knew but what it was or the cause or that she or any of those dear to her were in danger she did not know what has happened what does it all mean she asked in sudden alarm i have killed the roman governor the tile fell upon an unseen hand appeared to sprinkle her face with the dust of grew white so instantly she put her arm around him and looked wistfully but without word into his eyes his fears had passed to her and the sight of them gave him strength i did not it purposely was an accident he said more calmly what will they she asked he looked off over the tumult momentarily deepening in the street and on the roofs and thought of the sullen countenance of gratus if he were not dead where would his vengeance stop and if he were dead to what height of fury would not the violence of the people lash the legionaries to evade an answer he project gutenberg https the parapet again just the guard were assisting the roman to remount his horse he lives he lives tirzah blessed be the

his services and not hurt he was leading her to the summer when the roof jarred under their feet and crash of strong timbers being burst away followed by cry of surprise and agony arose apparently from the below he stopped and listened the cry was repeated then came rush of many feet and voices lifted in rage blent with voices in prayer and then the screams of women in mortal terror the soldiers had beaten in the north gate and were in possession of the house the terrible sense of being hunted smote him his ﬁrst impulse was to ﬂy but where noth ing but wings would serve him tirzah her eyes wild with fear caught his arm judah what does it mean the servants were being his mother was not one of the voices he heard hers with all the will left him he said stay here and wait tirzah i

let us the terrace or gallery at the foot of the steps was crowded with soldiers other soldiers with drawn swords ran in and out of the chambers at one place number of women on their knees clung to each other or prayed mercy apart from them one with torn garments and long hair streaming over her face struggled to tear loose from man all whose strength was tasked to keep his hold her cries were shrillest of all cutting through the clamor they had risen distinguishably to the roof to her judah steps were long and swift almost winged mother mother he shouted she stretched her hands towards him but when almost touching them he was seized and forced aside then he heard some one say speaking loudly that is he judah looked and what the said tall man in legionary armor of beautiful ﬁnish why he

use to you he said to the ofﬁcer there is richer entertainment in the street down eros up mars project gutenberg https the last words he disappeared judah understood him and in the bitterness of his soul prayed to heaven in the hour of thy vengeance lord he said be mine the hand to put it upon him by great exertion he drew nearer the ofﬁcer sir the woman you hear is my mother spare her spare my

cords and bind his hands and take him to the street his punishment is the mother was carried away the little tirzah in her home attire stupeﬁed with fear went passive ly with her keepers judah gave each of them last look and covered his face with his hands if to possess himself of the scene fadelessly he may have shed tears though one saw them there took place in him then what may be justly called the wonder of life the thoughtful reader of these pages has ere this discerned enough to know that the young jew in disposition was gentle even to result that seldom fails the habit of loving and being loved the circumstances through which he had come had made call upon the harshe r elements of his nature if such he had at times he had felt the stir and impulses of ambition but they had been like the formless dreams of child walking by the sea and gazing at the coming and going of stately ships but now if we can imagine an idol sensible of the worship it was accustomed to dashed suddenly from its altar and lying amidst the wreck of its little world of love an idea may be had of what had befallen the young and of its effect upon his being yet there was sign nothing to indicate

entire house hold were led out of the north gate the ruins of which choked the passageway the cries of the domestics some of whom had been born in the house were most pitiable when ﬁnally the horses and all the dumb tenantry of the place were driven past him judah began to comprehend the scope of the procurator s vengeance the very structure was devoted far the order was possible of execution nothing living was to be left within its walls if in judea there were others desperate enough to think of assassinati ng roman governor the story of what befell the princely family of hur would be warning to them while the ruin of the habitation would keep the story alive the ofﬁcer waited outside while detail of men temporarily restored the gate in the street the ﬁghting had almost ceased upon the houses here and there clouds of dust told where the struggle was project gutenberg https the cohort was the most part standing at rest its splendor like its ranks in nowise diminished borne past the point of care himself judah had heart nothing in view but the prisoners among whom he looked in vain his mother and tirzah suddenly from the earth where she had been lying woman arose and started swiftly back to the gate some of the guards reached out to seize her and great shout followed their failure she ran to judah and dropping down clasped his knees the coarse black hair powdered with dust veiling her eyes amrah good amrah he said to her god help you i can not she could not speak he bent down and whispered live amrah tirzah and my mother they will come back soldier drew her away

pasturage groves of orientalized the landscape the houses in irregular assemblage were of the humbler square and covered with vines the drought that had burned the hills of judea to crisp brown and lifeless stopped at the of galilee trumpet sounded when the cavalcad drew near the village had magical effect upon the inhabitants the gates and front doors cast forth groups eager to be the ﬁrst to catch the meaning of visitation so unusual nazareth it must be remembered was not only aside from any great highway but within the sway of judas of gamala wherefore it should not be hard to imagine the feelings with which the legionaries were received but when they were up and traversing the street the duty that occupied them became apparent and then fear and hatred were lost in curiosity under the impulse of which the people knowing there must be halt at the well in the northeastern part of the town quit their gates and doors and closed in after the procession prisoner whom the horsemen were guarding was the object of curiosity he was afoot bareheaded half naked his hands bound behind him thong ﬁxed to his wrists was looped over the neck of horse the dust went with the party when in movement wrapping him in yellow fog sometimes in dense cloud he drooped forward footsore and faint the villagers could see he was young at the well the decurion halted and with most of the men dismounted the prisoner sank down in the dust of the road stupeﬁed and asking nothing apparently he was in the last stage of exhaustion seeing when they came near that he was but boy the villagers would have helped him had they dared in the midst of their perplexity and while the pitchers were passing among the soldiers man was descried coming down project gutenberg https from sepphoris at

rest he stopped close by to survey the assemblage rabbi good rabbi joseph cried woman running to him here is prisoner come ask the soldiers about him that we may know who he is and what he has done and what they are going to with the rabbi s face remained stolid he glanced at the prisoner however and presently went to the ofﬁcer the peace of the lord be with you he said with unbending gravity and that of the gods with you the decurion replied are you from jerusalem your prisoner is in years may i ask what he has done he is an the people repeated the word in astonishment but rabbi joseph pursued his inquest is he son of israel he is jew said the roman dryly the wavering pity of the bystanders came back i know nothing of your tribes but can speak of his family the speaker continued you may have heard of prince of jerusalem named they called him he lived in herod s day i have seen him joseph said well this is his exclamations became general and the decurion hastened to stop them in the streets of jerusalem day before yesterday he nearly killed the noble gratus by ﬂinging tile upon his head from the roof of father s i there was pause in the conversation during which the nazarenes gazed at the young at wild beast did he kill him asked the rabbi he is under galleys the lord help him said joseph once moved out of his stolidity thereupon youth who came up with joseph but had stood behind him unobserved laid down an axe he had been carrying and going to the great stone standing by the well took from it pitcher of water the action was so quiet that before the project gutenberg

never face of boy about his own age shaded by locks of yellowish bright chestnut hair face lighted by eyes at the time so soft so appealing so full of love and holy purpose that they had all the power of command and will the spirit of the jew hardened though it was by days and nights of suffering and so embittered by wrong that its dreams of revenge took in all the world melted under the stranger s look and became child he put his lips to the pitcher and drank long and deep not word was said to him nor did he say word when the draught was ﬁnished the hand that had been resting upon the sufferer s shoulder was placed upon his head and stayed there in the dusty locks time enough to say blessing the stranger then returned the pitcher to its place on the stone and taking his axe again went back to rabbi joseph all eyes went with him the decurion s well those of the villagers this was the end of the scene at the well when the men had drunk and the horses the march was resumed but the temper of the decurion was not it had been he himself raised the prisoner from the dust and helped him on horse behind soldier the nazarenes went to their them rabbi joseph and his apprentice and so the ﬁrst

third she is not blind or ﬁckle at antium where our arrius questions her she answers him with nods and at sea she abides with him holding the rudder she takes him from us but does she not always give him back with new victory the greeks are taking him away another broke in let us abuse them not the gods in learning to trade they forgot how to with these words the party passed the gateway and came upon the mole with the bay before them beautiful in the morning light to the veteran sailor the plash of the waves was like greeting he drew long breath if the perfume of the water were sweeter than that of the nard and held his hand aloft my gifts were at praeneste not see wind from the west thanks fortune my mother he said earnestly the friends all repeated the exclamatio n and the slaves waved their torches she he continued pointing to galley outside the mole what need has sailor other mistress is your lucrece more graceful my caius he gazed at the coming ship and justiﬁe d his pride white sail was bent to the low mast and the oars dipped arose poised moment then dipped again with action and in perfect time yes spare the gods he said soberly his eyes ﬁxed upon the vessel they send us opportunities ours the fault if we fail and the greeks you forget my lentulus the pirates i am going to punish are greeks one victory over them is of more account than hundred over the then thy way is to the aegean the sailor s eyes were full of his ship what grace what freedom bird hath not less care the fretting of the waves see he said but almost immediately added thy pardon my lentulus i am going to the aegean and my departure is so near i will tell the keep it under the rose i would not that you abuse the duumvir when next you meet him he is my friend the trade between greece and alexandria ye may have heard is hardly inferior to that between alexandria and rome the people in that part of the world forgot to celebrate the cerealia and triptolemus paid them with harvest not worth the gathering at all events the trade is so grown that it will not brook interruption day ye may also have heard of the chersonesan pirates nested up in the euxine none bolder by the bacchae yesterday word came to rome that with ﬂeet they had rowed down the bosphorus sunk the galleys off byzantium and chalcedon swept the propontis and still unsated burst through into the aegean the who have ships in the east mediterranean are frightened they had audience with the emperor himself and from ravenna there go hundred galleys and from misenum paused if to pique the curiosity of his friends and ended with an happy quintus we congratulate thee project gutenberg https the preferment forerunneth promo tion we salute thee duumvir nothing quintus arrius the duumvir hath better sound than quintus arrius the in such manner they showered him with congratulations i am glad with the rest said the bibulous friend very glad but i must be practical my duumvir and not until i know if promotion will help thee to knowledge of the tesserae will i have an opinion to whether the gods mean thee ill or good in this thanks many thanks arrius replied speaking to them collectively had ye but lanterns i would say ye were augurs perpol i will go further and show what master diviners ye are from the folds of his toga he drew roll of paper and passed it to them saying received while at table last night the name was already great one in the roman world great and not so infamous it afterwards became sejanus they exclaimed with one voice closing in to read what the minister had written sejanus to caecilius rufus duumvir rome xix kal cæsar hath good report of quintus arrius the tribune in particular he hath heard of his valor manifested in the western seas insomuch that it is his will that the said quintus be transferred instantly to the east it is our cæsar s will further that you cause hundred triremes of the ﬁrst class and full appointment to be despatched without delay against the pirates who have appeared in the aegean and that quintus be sent to command the ﬂeet so despatched details are thine my caecilius the necessity is urgent thou will be advised by the reports enclosed thy perusal and the information of the said quintus arrius gave little heed to the reading the ship drew more plainly out of the perspective she became more and more an attraction to him the look with which he watched her was that of an enthusiast at length he tossed the loosened folds of his toga in the air in reply to the signal over the aplustre or ﬁxture at the stern of the vessel scarlet ﬂag was displayed while several sailors appeared upon the bulwarks and swung themselves hand over hand up the ropes to the antenna or yard and furled the sail the bow was put round and the time of the oars increased one half so that at racing speed she bore down directly towards him and his friends he observed the manoeuvring with perceptible brightening of the eyes her instant answer to the rudder and the steadiness with which she kept her course were especially noticeable virtues to be relied upon in action by the nymphae said one of the frien ds giving back the roll we may not longer say our friend will be great he is already great our love will now have famous things to feed upon what more hast thou us project gutenberg https nothing more arrius replied what ye have of the affair is by this time old news in rome especia lly between the palace and the forum the duumvir is discreet what i am to where go to ﬁnd my ﬂeet he will tell on the ship where sealed package is waiting if however ye have offerings any of the altars day pray the gods friend plying oar and sail somewhere in the direction of sicily but she is here and will come to he said reverting to the vessel i have interest in her masters they will sail and ﬁght with it is not an easy thing to lay ship side on shore like this so let us judge their training and what is she new to thee i never saw her before and yet i know not if she will bring one is that well it matters but little we of the sea come to know each other quickly our loves like our hates are born of sudden the vessel was of the class called naves narrow low in the water and modelled speed and quick manoeuvre the bow was beautiful jet of water spun from its foot she came on sprinkling all the prow which rose in graceful curvature twice man s stature above the plane of the deck upon the bending of the sides were ﬁgures of triton blowing shells below the bow ﬁxed to the keel and projecting forward under the water was the rostrum or beak device of solid wood reinforced and armed with iron in action used ram stout molding extended from the bow the full length of the ship s sides deﬁning the bulwarks which were tastefully crenelated below the molding in three rows each covered with cap or shield of hide were the holes in which the oars were on the right sixty on the left in further ornamentation caducei leaned against the lofty prow two immense ropes passing across the bow marked the number of anchors stowed on the foredeck the simplicity of the upper works declared the oars the chief dependence of the crew mast set little forward of midship was held by fore and back stays and shrouds ﬁxed to rings on the inner side of the bulwarks the tackle was that required the management of one great square sail and the yard to which it was hung above the bulwarks the deck was visible save the sailors who had reefed the sail and yet lingered on the yard but one man was to be seen by the party on the mole and he stood by the prow helmeted and with shield the hundred and twenty oaken blades kept white and shining by pumice and the constant wash of the waves rose and fell if operated by the same hand and drove the galley forward with speed rivalling that of modern steamer so rapidly and apparently so rashly did she come that the landsmen of the tribune s party were alarmed suddenly the man by the prow raised his hand with peculiar gesture whereupon all the oars ﬂew up poised moment in air then fell straight down the water boiled and bubbled about them the galley shook in every timber and stopped if scared another gesture of the hand and again the oars arose feathered and fell but this time those on the right dropping towards the stern pushed forward while those on the left dropping towards the bow pulled backwards three times the oars thus pushed and pulled against each other round project gutenberg https right the ship swung upon pivot then caught by the wind she settled gently broadside to the mole the movement brought the stern to view with all its tritons like those at the bow name in large raised letters the rudder at the side the elevated platform upon which the helmsman sat stately ﬁgure in full armor his hand upon the rudder and the aplustre high gilt carved and bent over the helmsman like great runcinate leaf in the midst of the trum pet was blown brief and shrill and from the hatchways out poured the marines all in superb equipment brazen helms burnished shields and javelins while the thus went to quarters action the sailors proper climbed the shrouds and perched themselves along the yard the ofﬁcers and musicians took their posts there was shouting or needless noise when the oars touched the mole bridge was sent out from the helmsman s deck then the tribune turned to his party and said with gravity he had not before shown duty now my he took the chaplet from his head and gave it to the take thou the myrtle favorite of the tesserae he said if i return i will seek my sestertii again if i am not victor i will not return hang the crown in thy to the company he opened his arms and they came one by one and received his parting embrace the gods go with thee quintus they said farewell he replied to the slaves waving their torches he waved his hand then he turned to the waiting ship beautiful with ordered ranks and crested helms and shields and javelins he stepped upon the bridge the trumpets sounded and over the aplustre rose the vexillum purpureum or pennant of commander of project gutenberg https ii the tribune standing upon the helmsman s deck with the order of the duumvir open in his hand spoke to the chief of the rowers 1 1 called hortator what force hast thou of oarsmen two hundred and ten supernumeraries making reliefs and thy habit it has been to take of f and put on every two the tribune mused moment the division is hard and i will reform it but not now the oars may not rest day or then to the he said the wind is fair let the sail help the when the two thus addressed were gone he turned to the chief pilot 2 2 called rector what service hast thou had in what seas chieﬂy between our rome and the thou art the man i would have the tribune looked at his orders again past the camponellan cape the course will be to messina beyond that follow the bend of the calabrian shore till melito is on thy left knowest thou the stars that govern in the ionian sea i know them then from melito course eastward cythera the gods willing i will not anchor until in the bay of antemona the duty is urgent i rely upon prudent man was and of the class which while enriching the altars at praeneste and antium was of opinion nevertheless that the favor of the blind goddess depended more upon the votary s care and judgment than upon his gifts and vows all night master of the feast he had sat at table drinking and playing yet the odor of the sea returned him to the mood of the sailor and he would not rest until he knew his ship knowledge leaves room chances having begun with the chief of the rowers the and the pilot in company with the other commander of the marines the keeper of the stores the master of the machines the overseer of the kitchen or passed through the several quarters nothing escaped project gutenberg https when he was through of the community crowded within the narrow walls he alone knew perfectly all there was of material preparation the voyage and its possible incidents and ﬁnding the preparation complete there was left him but one thing knowledge of the personnel of his command this was the most delicate and difﬁcult part of his task requiring much time he set about it his own way at noon that day the galley was skimming the sea off paestum the wind was yet from the west ﬁlling the sail to the master s content the watches had been established on the foredeck the altar had been set and sprinkled with salt and barley and before it the tribune had offered solemn prayers to jove and to neptune and all the oceanidæ and with vows poured the wine and burned the incense and now the better to study his men he was seated in the great cabin very martial ﬁgure the cabin it should be stated was the central compartment of the galley in extent quite by thirty feet and lighted by three broad hatchways row of stanchions ran from end to end supporting the roof and near the centre the mast was visible all bristling with axes and spears and javelins to each hatchway there were double stairs descending right and left with pivotal arrangement at the top to allow the lowe r ends to be hitched to the ceiling and these were now raised the compartment had the appearance of skylighted hall the reader will understand readily that this was the heart of the ship the home of all m ﬁeld of exercise off made possible by the laws which reduced life there to minute details and routine relentless death at the of the cabin there was platform reached by several steps upon it the chief of the rowers sat in front of him upon which with gavel he beat time the oarsmen at his right clepsydra or to measure the reliefs and watches above him on higher platform well guarded by gilded railing the tribune had his quarters overlooking everything and furnished with couch table and cathedra or chair cushioned and with arms and high which the imperial dispensation permitted of the utmost elegance thus at ease lounging in the great chair swaying with the motion of the vessel the military cloak half draping his tunic sword in belt arrius kept watchful eye over his command and was closely watched by them he saw critically everything in view but dwelt longest upon the rowers the reader would doubtless have done the same only he would have looked with much sympathy while is the habit with masters the tribune s mind ran forward of what he saw inquiring results the spectacle was simple enough of itself along the sides of the cabin ﬁxed to the ship s timbers were what at ﬁrst appeared to be three rows of benches closer view however showed them succession of rising banks in each of which the second bench was behind and above the ﬁrst one and the third above and behind the second to accommodate the sixty rowers on side the space devoted to them permitted nineteen banks separated by intervals of one yard with twentieth bank divided so that what would have been its upper seat or bench was directly above the lower seat of the ﬁrst bank the arrangement gave each rower when at project gutenberg https room if he timed his movements with those of his associates the principle being that of soldiers marching with cadenced step in close order the arrangement also allowed multiplication of banks limited only by the length of the galley to the rowers those upon the ﬁrst and second benches sat while those upon the third having longer oars to work were suffered to stand the oars were loaded with lead in the handles and near the point of balance hung to pliable thongs making possible the delicate touch called feathe ring but at the same time increasing the need of skill since an eccentric wave might at any moment catch heedless fellow and hurl him from his seat each was vent through which the laborer opposite it had his plenty of sweet air light streamed down upon him from the grating which formed the ﬂoor of the passage between the deck and the bulwark over his head in some respects therefore the condition of the men might have been much worse still it must not be imagined that there was any pleasantness in their lives communication between them was not allowed day after day they ﬁlled their places without speech in hours of labor they could not see each other s faces their short respites were given to sleep and the snatching of food they never laughed one ever heard one of them sing what is the use of tongues when sigh or groan will tell all men feel while perforce they think in silence existence with the poor wretches was like stream under ground sweeping slowly laboriously on to its outlet wherever that might chance to be son of mary the sword has now thine the glory so now but in the days of which we are writing captivity there was drudgery on walls and in the streets and mines and the galleys both of war and commerce were insatiable when druilius won the ﬁrst his country romans plied the oars and the glory was to the rower not less than the marine these benches which now we are trying to see they were testiﬁed to the change come with conquest and illustrated both the policy and the prowess of rome nearly all the nations had sons there mostly prisoners of war chosen their brawn and endurance in one place briton before him libyan behind him crimean elsewhere scythian gaul and thebasite roman convicts cast down to consort with goths and longobardi jews ethiopians and barbarians from the shores of maeotis here an athenian there savage from hibernia yonder eyed giants of the cimbri in the labor of the rowers there was not enough art to give occupation to their minds rude and simple they were the reach forward the pull the feathering the blade the dip were all there was of it motions most perfect when most automatic even the care forced upon them by the sea outside grew in time to be thing instinctive rather than of thought so the result of long service the poor wretches became spiritless obedient of vast muscle and exhausted intellects who lived upon recollections generally few but dear and at last lowered into the alchemic state wherein misery turns to habit and the soul takes on incredible endurance from right to left hour after hour the tribune swaying in his turned with thought of everything rather than the wretchedness of the slaves upon the benches their motions precise and exactly the same on both sides of the vessel after project gutenberg https became monotonous and then he amused himself singling out individuals with his stylus he made note of objections thinking if all went well he would ﬁnd among the pirates of whom he was in search better men the places there was need of keeping the proper names of the slaves brought to the galleys to their graves so convenience they were usually identiﬁed by the numerals painted upon the benches to which they were assigned the sharp eyes of the great man moved from seat to seat on either hand they came at last to number sixty which has been said belonged properly to the last bank on the side but wanting room aft had been ﬁxed above the ﬁrst bench of the ﬁrst bank there they rested the bench of number sixty was slightly above the level of the platform and but few feet away the light glinting through the grating over his head gave the rower fairly to the tribune s erect and like all his fellows naked except cincture about the loins there were however some points in his favor he was very young not more than twenty furtherm ore arrius was not merely given to dice he was connoisseur of men physically and when ashore indulged habit of visiting the gymnasia to see and admire the most famous athletae from some professor doubtless he had caught the idea that strength was much of the quality the quantity of the muscle while superiority in performance required certain mind well strength having adopted the doctrine like most men with hobby he was always looking illustrations to support it the reader may well believe that while the tribune in the search the perfect was often called upon to stop and study he was seldom perfectly fact very seldom held long on this occasion in the beginning of each movement of the oar the rower s body and face were brought into proﬁle view from the platform the movement ended with the body reversed and in pushing posture the grace and ease of the action at ﬁrst suggested doubt of the honesty of the effort put forth but it was speedily dismissed the ﬁrmness with which the oar was held while in the reach forward its bending under the push were proofs of the force applied not that only they certainly proved the rower s art and put the critic in the great in search of the combination of strength and cleverness which was the central idea of his theory in course of the study arrius observed the subject s youth wholly unconscious of tenderness on that account he also observed that he seemed of good height and that his limbs upper and nether were singularly perfect the arms perhaps were too long but the objection was well hidden under mass of muscle which in some movements swelled and knotted like kinking cords every rib in the round body was discernible yet the leanness was the healthful reduction so strained after in the palaestrae and altogether there was in the rower s action certain harmony which besides addressing itself to the tribune s theory stimulated both his curiosity and general interest very soon he found himself waiting to catch view of the man s face in full the head was shapely and balanced upon neck broad at the base but of exceeding pliancy and grace the features in proﬁle were of oriental outline and of that delicacy of expression which has always been thought sign of blood and sensitive project gutenberg https these observations the tribune s interest in the subject deepened by the gods he said to himself the fellow impresses he promises well i will know more of directly the tribune caught the view he rower turned and looked at him jew and boy under the gaze then ﬁxed steadily upon him the large eyes of the slave grew blood surged to his very blade lingered in his hands but instantly with an angry crash down fell the gavel of the hortator the rower started withdrew his face from the inquisitor and if personally chidden dropped the oar half feathered when he glanced again at the tribune he was vastly more was met with kindly smile meantime the galley entered the straits of messina and skimming past the city of that name was after while turned eastward leaving the cloud over ætna in the sky astern often arrius resumed to his platform in the cabin he returned to study the rower and he kept saying to himself the fellow hath spirit jew is not barbarian i will know more of project gutenberg https iii the fourth day out and the the galley was named through the ionian sea the sky was clear and the wind blew if bearing the of all the gods it was possible to overtake the ﬂeet before reaching the bay east of the island of cythera designated assemblage arrius somewhat impatient spent much time on deck he took note diligently of matters pertaining to his ship and rule was well pleased in the cabin swinging in the great chair his thought continually reverted to the rower on number sixty knowest thou the man just come from yon bench he at length asked of the hortator relief was going on at the moment from number sixty returned the chief the chief looked sharply at the rower then going forward thou knowest he replied the ship is but month from the maker s hand and the men are new to the he is jew arrius remarked thoughtfully the noble quintus is he is very young arrius continued but our best rower said the other i have seen his oar bend almost to of what disposition is he he is obedient further i know not once he made request of what he wished to change him alternately from the right to the did he give reason he had observed that the men who are conﬁned to one side become misshapen he also said that some day of storm or battle there might be sudden need to change him and he might then be perpol the idea is new what else hast thou observed of him he is cleanly above his in that he is roman said arrius approvingly have you nothing of his history not the tribune reﬂected awhile and turned to go to his own seat if i should be on deck when his time is up he paused to say send him to let him come about two hours later arrius stood under the aplustre of the galley in the mood of one who seeing himself carried swiftly towards an event of mighty import has nothing to but the mood in which philosophy vests an man with the utmost calm and is ever so serviceable the pilot sat with project gutenberg https the rope by which the rudder paddles one on each side of the vessel were managed in the shade of the sail some sailors lay asleep and up on the yard there was lookout lifting his eyes from the solarium set under the aplustre reference in keeping the course arrius beheld the rower approaching the chief called thee the noble arrius and said it was thy will that i should seek thee here i have arrius surveyed the ﬁgure tall sinewy glistening in the sun and tinted by the rich red blood within it admiringly and with thought of the arena yet the manner was not without effect upon him there was in the voice suggestion of life at least partly spent under reﬁning inﬂuences the eyes were clear and open and more curious than deﬁant to the shrewd demanding masterful glance bent upon it the face gave back nothing to mar its youthful of accusation or sullenness or menace only the signs which great sorrow long borne imprints time mellows the surface of pictures in tacit acknowledgment of the effect the roman spoke an older man to younger not master to slave the hortator tells thou art his best rower the hortator is very kind the rower answered hast thou seen much service about three at the oars i can not recall day of rest from the labor is hard few men bear it year without breaking and art but boy the noble arrius forgets that the spirit hath much to with endurance by its help the weak sometimes thrive when the strong from thy speech thou art jew my ancestors further back than the ﬁrst roman were the stubborn pride of thy race is not lost in thee said arrius observing ﬂush upon the rower s face pride is never so loud when in what cause hast thou pride that i am jew arrius smiled i have not been to jerusalem he said but i have heard of its princes i knew one of them he was merchant and sailed the seas he was ﬁt to have been king of what degree art thou i must answer thee from the bench of galley i am of the degree of slaves my father was prince of jerusalem and merchant he sailed the seas he was known and honored in the of the great his name ithamar of the house of hur the tribune raised his hand in astonishment son of after silence he asked what brought thee here project gutenberg https lowered his head and his breast labored hard when his feelings were sufﬁciently mastered he looked the tribune in the face and answered i was accused of attempting to assassinate valerius gratus the procurator thou cried arrius yet more amazed and retreating step thou that assassin all rome rang with the story it came to my ship in the river by the two regarded each other silently i thought the family of hur blotted from the earth said arrius speaking ﬁrst ﬂood of tender recollections carried the young man s pride away tears shone upon his cheeks and my little tirzah where are they tribune noble tribune if thou knowest anything of them clasped his hands in tell all thou knowest tell if they are living where are they and in what condition oh i pray thee tell he drew nearer arrius so near that his hands touched the cloak where it dropped from the latter s folded arms the horrible day is three years gone he three years tribune and every hour whole lifetime of lifetime in bottomless pit with death and relief but in and in all that time not word from any one not whisper oh if in being forgotten we could only forget if only i could hide from that sister torn from my mother s last look i have felt the plague s breath and the shock of ships in battle i have heard the tempest lashing the sea and laughed though others prayed death would have been riddance bend the in the strain of mighty effort trying to escape the haunting of what that day occurred think what little will help tell they are dead if more happy they can not be while i am lost i have heard them call in the night i have seen them on the water walking oh never anything so true my mother s love and breath was the breath of white lilies she was the youngest branch of the fresh so tender so graceful so beautiful she made my day all morning she came and went in music and mine was the hand that laid them low dost thou admit thy guilt asked arrius sternly the change that came upon was wonderful to see it was so instant and extreme the voice sharpened the hands arose every ﬁbre thrilled his eyes inﬂamed thou hast heard of the god of my fathers he said of the inﬁnite jehovah by his truth and almightiness and by the love with which he hath followed israel from the beginning i swear i am innocent the tribune was much moved noble roman continued give little faith and into my darkness deeper darkening every day send light arrius turned away and walked the deck didst thou not have trial he asked stopping suddenly the roman raised his head surprised witnesses who passed judgment upon thee project gutenberg https it should be remembered were at time such lovers of the law and its forms in the ages of their decay they bound with cords and dragged to vault in the tower i saw one one spoke to next day soldiers took to the seaside i have been ever what couldst thou have proven i was boy too young to be conspirator gratus was stranger to if i had meant to kill him that was not the time or the place he was riding in the midst of legion and it was broad day i could not have escaped i was of class most friendly to rome my father had been distinguished his services to the emperor we had great estate to lose ruin was certain to myself my mother my sister i had cause malice while every family life conscience the son of israel the breath of his have stayed my hand though the foul intent had been ever so strong i was not mad death was preferable to shame and believe i pray it is so who was with thee when the blow was struck i was on the father s house tirzah was with my soul of gentleness together we leaned over the parapet to see the legion pass tile gave way under my hand and fell upon gratus i thought i had killed him ah what horror i felt where was thy mother in her chamber below what became of her clenched his hands and drew breath like gasp i not know i saw them drag her is all i know out of the house they drove every living thing even the dumb cattle and they sealed the gates the purpose was that she should not return i too ask her oh one word she at least was innocent i can i pray thy pardon noble tribune slave like should not talk of forgiveness or of revenge i am bound to an oar arrius listened intently he brought all his experience with slaves to his aid if the feeling shown in this instance were assumed the acting was perfect on the other hand if it were real the jew s innocence might not be doubted and if he were innocent with what blind fury the power had been exercised whole family blotted out to atone an accident the thought shocked him there is wiser providence than that our occupations however rude or bloody can not wear us out morally that such qualities justice and mercy if they really possess us continue to live on under them like ﬂowers under the snow the tribune could be inexorable else he had not been ﬁt the usages of his calling he could also be just and to excite his sense of wrong was to put him in the way to right the wrong the crews of the ships in which he served came after time to speak of him the good tribune shrewd readers will not want better deﬁnition of his character in this instance there were many circumstances certainly in the young man s favor and some to be supposed possibly arrius knew valerius gratus without loving him possibly he had known the elder hur in the course of his appeal judah had asked him of that and will be noticed he had made reply project gutenberg https once the tribune was at loss and hesitated his power was ample he was monarch of the ship his prepossessions all moved him to mercy his faith was won yet he said to himself there was rather there was haste to cythera the best rower could not then be spared he would wait he would learn more he would at least be sure this was the prince and that he was of right disposition ordinarily slaves were liars it is enough he said aloud go back to thy bowed looked once more into the master s face but saw nothing hope he turned away slowly looked back and said if thou dost think of again tribune let it not be lost in thy mind that i prayed thee only word of my sister he moved on arrius followed him with admiring eyes perpol he thought with teaching what man the arena what runner ye gods what an arm the sword or the cestus he said aloud stopped and the tribune went to him if thou wert free what wouldst thou the noble arrius mocks judah said with trembling lips by the gods then i will answer gladly i would give myself to duty the ﬁrst of life i would know other i would know rest until my mother and tirzah were restored to home i would give every day and hour to their happiness i would wait upon them never slave more faithful they have lost much but by the god of my fathers i would ﬁnd them more the answer was unexpected by the roman moment he lost his purpose i spoke to thy ambition he said recovering if thy mother and sister were dead or not to be found what wouldst thou distinct pallor overspread s face and he looked over the sea there was struggle with some strong feeling when it was conquered he turned to the tribune what pursuit would i follow he asked tribune i will tell thee truly only the night before the dreadful day of which i have spoken i obtained permission to be soldier i am of the same mind yet and in all the earth there is but one school of war thither i would the palaestra exclaimed arrius roman but thou must ﬁrst acquaint thyself with the use of now master may never safely advise slave arrius saw his indiscretion and in breath chilled his voice and manner go now he said and not build upon what has passed between us perhaps i but play with thee or looked away or if thou dost think of it with any hope choose between the renown of gladiator and the service of soldier the former may come of the favor of the emperor there is reward thee in the latter thou art not roman go project gutenberg https short while after was upon his bench again man s task is always light if his heart is light handling the oar did not seem so toilsome to judah hope had come to him like singing bird he could hardly see the visitor or hear its song that it was there though he knew his feelings told him so the caution of the perhaps i but play with thee dismissed often it recurred to his mind that he had been called by the great man and asked his story was the bread upon which he fed his hungry spirit surely something good would come of it the light about his bench was clear and bright with promises and he prayed god i am true son of the israel thou hast so loved help i pray thee project gutenberg https iv in the bay of antemona east of cythera the island the hundred galleys assembled there the tribune gave one day to inspection he sailed then to naxos the largest of the cyclades midway the coasts of greece and asia like great stone planted in the centre of highway from which he could challenge everything that passed at the same time he would be in position to go after the pirates instantly whether they were in the ægean or out on the mediterranean the ﬂeet in order rowed in towards the mountain shores of the island galley was descried coming from the north arrius went to meet it she proved to be transport just from byzantium and from her commander he learned the particulars of which he stood in most need the pirates were from all the farther shores of the euxine even tanais at the mouth of the river which was supposed to feed palus maeotis was represented among them their preparations had been with the greatest secrecy the ﬁrst known of them was their appearance off the entrance to the thracian bosphorus followed by the destruction of the ﬂeet in station there thence to the outlet of the hellespont everything aﬂoat had fallen their prey there were quite sixty galleys in the squadron all well manned and supplied few were biremes the rest stout triremes greek was in command and the pilots said to be familiar with all the eastern seas were greek the plunder had been incalculable the panic consequently was not on the sea alone cities with closed gates sent their people nightly to the walls trafﬁc had almost ceased where were the pirates now to this question of most interest to arrius he received answer after sacking hephaestia on the island of lemnos the enemy had coursed across to the thessalian group and by last account disappeared in the gulfs between euboea and hellas such were the tidings then the people of the island drawn to the by the rare spectacle of hundred ships careering in united squadron beheld the advance division suddenly turn to the north and the others follow wheeling upon the same point like cavalry in column news of the piratical descent had reached them and now watching the white sails until they faded from sight up between rhene and syros the thoughtful among them took comfort and were grateful what rome seized with strong hand she always defended in return their taxes she gave them safety the tribune was more than pleased with the enemy s movements he was doubly thankful to fortune she had brought swift and sure intelligence and had lured his foes into the waters where of all others destruction was most assured he knew the havoc one galley could play in broad sea like the mediterranean and the difﬁculty of ﬁnding and overhauling her he knew also how those very circumstances would enhance the service and glory if at one blow he could put ﬁnish to the whole piratical array project gutenberg https the reader will take map of greece and the ægean he will notice the island of euboea lying along the classic coast like rampart against asia leaving channel between it and the continent quite hundred and twenty miles in length and scarcely an average of eight in width the inlet on the north had admitted the ﬂeet of xerxes and now it received the bold raiders from the euxine the towns along the pelasgic and meliac gulfs were rich and their plunder seductive all things considered therefore arrius judged that the robbers might be found somewhere below thermopylae welcoming the chance he resolved to enclose them north and south to which not an hour could be lost even the fruits and wines and women of naxos must be left behind so he sailed away without stop or tack until little before nightfall mount ocha was seen upreared again st the sky and the pilot reported the euboean coast at signal the ﬂeet rested upon its oars when the movement was resumed arrius led division of ﬁfty of the galleys intending to take them up the channel while anoth er division equally strong turned their prows to the outer or seawa rd side of the island with orders to make all haste to the upper inlet and descend sweeping the waters to be sure neither division was equal in number to the pirates but each had advantages in compensa tion among them by means least discipline impossible to lawless horde however brave besides it was shrewd count on the tribune s side if peradventure one should be defeated the other would ﬁnd the enemy shattered by his victory and in condition to be easily overwhelmed meantime kept his bench relieved every six hours the rest in the bay of antemona had freshened him so that the oar was not troublesome and the chief on the platform found fault people generally are not aware of the ease of mind there is in knowing where they are and where they are going the sensation of being lost is keen distress still worse is the feeling one has in driving blindly into unknown places custom had dulled the feeling with but only measurably pulling away hour after hour sometimes days and nights together sensible all the time that the galley was gliding swiftly along some of the many tracks of the broad sea the longing to know where he was and whither going was always present with him but now it seemed quickened by the hope which had come to new life in his breast since the interview with the tribune the narrower the place happens to be the more intense is the longing and so he found he seemed to hear every sound of the ship in labor and listened to each one if it were voice come to tell him something he looked to the grating overhead and through it into the light of which so small portion was his expecting he knew not what and many times he caught himself on the point of yielding to the impulse to speak to the chief on the platform than which circumstance of battle would have astonished that dignitary more in his long service by watching the shifting of the meager sunbeams upon the cabin ﬂoor when the ship was under way he had come to know generally the quarter into which she was sailing this of course was only of clear days like those fortune was sending the tribune the experience had not failed him in the period succeeding the departure from cythera project gutenberg https were tending towards the old judean country he was sensitive to every variation from the course with pang he had observed the sudden change northward which has been noticed took place near naxos the cause however he could not even conjecture it must be remembered that in common with his he knew nothing of the situation and had interest in the voyage his place was at the oar and he was held there inexorably whether at anchor or under sail once only in three years had he been permitted an outlook from the deck the occasion we have seen he had idea that following the vessel he was helping drive there was great squadron close at hand and in beautiful order more did he know the object of which it was in pursuit when the sun going down withdrew his last ray from the cabin the galley still held northward night fell yet could discern change about that time the smell of incense ﬂoated down the gangways from the deck the tribune is at the altar he thought can it be we are going into battle he became observant now he had been in many battles without having seen one from his bench he had heard them above and about him until he was familiar with all their notes almost singer with song so too he had become acquainted with many of the preliminaries of an engagement of which with rom an well greek the most invariable was the sacriﬁce to the gods the rites were the same those performed at the beginning of voyage and to him when noticed they were always an admonition battle it should be observed possessed him and his of the oar an interest unlike that of the sailor and marine it came not of the danger encountered but of the fact that defeat if survived might bring an alteration of possibly least change of masters which might be the better in good time the lanterns were lighted and hung by the stairs and the tribune came down from the deck at his word the marines put on their armor at his word again the machines were looked to and spears javelins and arrows in great sheaves brought and laid upon the ﬂoor together with jars of inﬂammable oil and baskets of cotton balls wound loose like the wicking of candles and when ﬁnally saw the tribune mount his platform and don his armor and get his helmet and shield out the meaning of the preparations might not be any longer doubted and he made ready the last ignominy of his service to every bench ﬁxture there was chain with heavy anklets these the hortator proceeded to lock upon the oarsmen going from number to number leaving choice but to obey and in event of disaster possibility of escape in the cabin then silence fell broken at ﬁrst only by the sough of the oars turning in the leathern cases every man upon the benches felt the shame more keenly than his companions he would have put it away at any price soon the clanking of the fetters notiﬁed him of the progress the chief was making in his round he would come to him in turn but would not the tribune interpose him project gutenberg https thought may be set down to vanity or selﬁshness the reader pleases it certainly at that moment took possession of he believed the roman would interpose anyhow the circumstance would test the man s feelings if intent upon the battle he would but think of him it would be proof of his opinion that he had been tacitly promoted above his associates in proof would justify hope waited anxiously the interval seemed like an age at every turn of the oar he looked towa rds the tribune who his simple preparations made lay down upon the couch and composed himself to rest whereupon number sixty chid himself and laughed grimly and resolved not to look that way again the hortator approached now he was at number rattle of the iron links sounded horribly at last number sixty calm from despair held his oar at poise and gave his foot to the ofﬁcer then the tribune to the chief strong revulsion seized the jew from the hortator the great man glanced at him and when he dropped his oar all the section of the ship on his side seemed aglow he heard nothing of what was said enough that the chain hung idly from its staple in the bench and that the chief going to his seat began to beat the board the notes of the gavel were never so like music with his breast against the leaded handle he pushed with all his pushed until the shaft bent if about to break the chief went to the tribune and smiling pointed to number sixty what strength he said and what spirit the tribune answered perpol he is better without the irons put them on him so saying he stretched himself upon the couch again the ship sailed on hour after hour under the oars in water scarcely rippled by the wind and the people not on duty slept arrius in his place the marines on the ﬂoor was relieved but he could not sleep three years of night and through the darkness sunbeam at last at sea adrift and lost and now land dead so long and lo the thrill and stir of resurrection sleep was not such an hour hope deals with the future now and the past are but servants that wait on her with impulse and suggestive circumstance starting from the favor of the tribune she carried him forward indeﬁnitely the wonder is not that things so purely imaginative the results she points us to can make us so happy but that we can receive them so real they must be gorgeous popp ies under the inﬂuence of which under the crimson and purple and gold reason lies down the while and is not sorrows assuaged home and the fortunes of his house restored mother and sister in his arms once were the central ideas which made him happier that moment than he had ever been that he was rushing on wings into horrible battle had the time nothing to with his thoughts the things thus in hope were unmixed with were hence his joy so full so perfect there was room in his heart revenge messala gratus rome and all the bitter passionate memories connected with them were dead of the earth above which he ﬂoated far and safe listening to singing stars the deeper darkness before the dawn was upon the waters and all things going well with the astroea when man project gutenberg https the deck walked swiftly to the platform where the tribune slept and awoke him arrius arose put on his helmet sword and shield and went to the commander of the marines the pirates are close by up and ready he said and passed to the stairs calm conﬁdent insomuch that one might have thought happy fellow apicius has set feast project gutenberg https v every soul aboard even the ship awoke ofﬁcers went to their quarters the marines took arms and were led out looking in all respects like legionaries sheaves of arrows and armfuls of javelins were carried on deck by the central stairs the and balls were set ready use additional lanterns were lighted buckets were ﬁlled with water the rowers in relief assembled under guard in front of the chief providence would have it was one of the latter overhead he heard the mufﬂed noises of the ﬁnal the sailors furling sail spreading the nettings unslinging the machines and hanging the armor of over the side presently quiet settled about the galley again quiet full of vague dread and expectation which interpreted means ready at signal passed down from the deck and communicated to the hortator by petty ofﬁcer stationed on the stairs all at once the oars stopped what did it mean of the hundred and twenty slaves chained to the benches not one but asked himself the question they were without incentive patriotism love of honor sense of duty brought them inspiration they felt the thrill common to men rushed helpless and blind into danger it may be supposed the dullest of them poising his oar thought of all that might happen yet could promise himself nothing victory would but rivet his chains the ﬁrmer while the chances of the ship were his sinking or on ﬁre he was doomed to her fate of the situation without they might not ask and who were the enemy and what if they were friends brethren countrymen the reader carrying the suggestion forward will see the necessity which governed the roman when in such emer gencies he locked the hapless wretches to their seats there was little time however such thought with them sound like the rowing of galleys astern attracted and the astroea rocked if in the midst of countering waves the idea of ﬂeet at hand broke upon ﬂeet in probably attack his blood started with the fancy another signal came down from the deck the oars dipped and the galley started imperceptibly sound from without none from within yet each man in the cabin instinctively poised himself shock the very ship seemed to catch the sense and hold its breath and go crouched tiger in such situation time is inappreciable so that could form judgment of distance gone at last there was sound of trumpets on deck full clear long blown the chief beat the until it rang the rowers reached forward full length and deepening the dip of their oars pulled suddenly with all their united force the galley quivering in every timber answered with leap other trumpets joined in the from the rear none the latter quarter only project gutenberg https of voices in tumult heard brieﬂy there was mighty blow the rowers in front of the chief s platform reeled some of them fell the ship bounded back recovered and rushed on more irresistibly than before shrill and high arose the shrieks of men in terror over the blare of trumpets and the grind and crash of the collision they arose then under his feet under the keel pounding rumbling breaking to pieces drowning felt something overridden the men about him looked at each other afraid shout of triumph from the beak of the roman had won but who were they whom the sea had drunk of what tongue from what land were they pause stay forward rushed the astroea and it went some sailors ran down and plunging the cotton balls into the tanks tossed them dripping to comrades at the head of the stairs ﬁre was to be added to other horrors of the combat directly the galley heeled over so far that the oarsmen on the uppermost side with difﬁculty kept their benches again the hearty roman cheer and with it despairing shrieks an opposing vessel caught by the of the great crane swinging from the prow was being lifted into the air that it might be dropped and sunk the shouting increased on the right hand and on the left before behind swelled an indescribable clamor occasionally there was crash followed by sudden peals of fright telling of other ships ridden down and their crews drowned in the vortexes nor was the ﬁght all on one side now and then roman in armor was borne down the hatchway and laid bleeding sometimes dying on the ﬂoor sometimes also puffs of smoke blend ed with steam and foul with the scent of roasting human ﬂesh poured into the cabin turning the dimming light into yellow murk gasping breath the while knew they were passin g through the cloud of ship on ﬁre and burning up with the rowers chained to the benches the astroea all this time was in motion suddenly she stopped the oars forward were dashed from the hands of the rowers and the rowers from their benches on deck then furious trampling and on the sides grinding of ships afoul of each other the ﬁrst time the beating of the gavel was lost in the uproar men sank on the ﬂoor in fear or looked about seeking in the midst of the panic body plunged or was pitched headlong down the hatchway falling near he beheld the carcass mass of hair blackening the face and under it shield of and wicker barbarian from the nations of the north whom death had robbed of plunder and revenge how came he there an iron hand had snatched him from the opposing the astroea had been boarded the romans were ﬁghting on their own deck chill smote the young jew arrius was hard might be defending his own life if he should be slain god of abraham forefend the hopes and dreams so lately come were they only hopes and dreams mother and he not to see them after all the tumult thundered above him he looked around in the cabin all was rowers on the benches paralyzed men running blindly hither and thither only the chief on his seat imperturbable vainly beating the and waiting project gutenberg https of the the red murk illustrating the matchless discipline which had won the world the example had good effect upon he controlled himself enough to think honor and duty bound the roman to the platform but what had he to with such motives then the bench was thing to run from while if he were to die slave who would be the better of the sacriﬁce with him living was duty if not honor his life belonged to his people they arose before him never more real he saw them their arms outstretched he heard them imploring him and he would go to them he stopped alas roman judgment held him in doom while it endured escape would be proﬁtless in the wide wide earth there was place in which he would be safe from the imperial demand upon the land none nor upon the sea whereas he required freedom according to the forms of law so only could he abide in judea and execute the ﬁlial purpose to which he would devote himself in other land he would not live dear god how he had waited and watched and prayed such release and how it had been delayed but at last he had seen it in the promise of the tribune what else the great man s meaning and if the benefactor so belated should now be slain the dead come not back to redeem the pledges of the living it should not should not die at least better perish with him than survive once more looked around upon the roof of the cabin the battle yet beat against the sides the hostile vessels yet crushed and grided on the benches the slaves struggled to tear loose from their chains and ﬁnding their efforts vain howled like madmen the guards had gone upstairs discipline was out panic in the chief kept his chair unchanged calm the gavel weaponless vainly with his clangor he ﬁlled the lulls in the din gave him last look then broke in ﬂight but to seek the tribune very short space lay between him and the stairs of the hatchway aft he took it with leap and was up the steps far enough to catch glimpse of the sky with ﬁre of the ships alongside of the sea covered with ships and wrecks of the ﬁght closed in about the pilot s quart er the assailants many the defenders suddenly his foothold was knocked away and he pitched backward the ﬂoor when he reached it seemed to be lifting itself and breaking to pieces then in twinkling the whole of the hull broke asunder and if it had all the time been lying in wait the sea hissin g and foaming leaped in and all became darkness and sur ging water to it can not be said that the young jew helped himself in this stress besides his usual strength he had the indeﬁnite extra force which nature keeps in reserve just such perils to life yet the darkness and the whirl and roar of water stupeﬁed him even the holding his breath was involuntary the inﬂux of the ﬂood tossed him like log forward into the cabin where he would have drowned but the reﬂuence of the sinking motion it was fathoms under the surface the hollow mass vomited him forth and he arose along with the loosed debris in the act of rising he clutched something and held to it the time he was under seemed an age longer than it really was at last he gained the top with great gasp he ﬁlled his lungs afresh and tossing the water from his hair and eyes climbed higher upon the plank he held and looked about project gutenberg https had pursued him closely under the waves he found it waiting him when he was multiform smoke lay upon the sea like semitransparent fog through which here and there shone cores of intense brilliance quick intelligence told him that they were ships on ﬁre the battle was yet on nor could he say who was victor within the radius of his vision now and then ships passed shooting shadows athwart lights out of the dun clouds farther on he caught the crash of other ships colliding the danger however was closer at hand when the astroea went down her deck it will be recollected held her own crew and the crews of the two galleys which had attacked her at the same time all of whom were ingulf ed many of them came to the surface together and on the same plank or support of whatever kind continued the combat begun possibly in the vortex fathoms down writhing and twisting in deadly embrace sometimes striking with sword or javelin they kept the sea around them in agitation at one place at another aﬂame with ﬁery reﬂections with their struggles he had nothing to they were all his enemies not one of them but would kill him the plank upon which he ﬂoated he made haste to get away about that time he heard oars in quickes t movement and beheld galley coming down upon him the tall prow seemed doubly tall and the red light playing upon its gilt and carving gave it an appearance of snaky life under its foot the water churned to ﬂying foam he struck out pushing the plank which was very broad and unmanageable seconds were second might save or lose him in the crisis of the effort up from the sea within arm s reach helmet shot like gleam of gold next came two hands with ﬁngers ge hands were they and hold once ﬁxed might not be loosed swerved from them appalled up rose the helmet and the head it two arms which began to beat the water head turned back and gave the face to the light the mouth gaping wide the eyes open but sightless and the bloodless pallor of drowning never anything more ghastly yet he gave cry of joy at the sight and the face was going under again he caught the sufferer by the chain which passed from the helmet beneath the chin and drew him to the plank the man was arrius the tribune while the water foamed and eddied violently about hur taxing all his strength to hold to the support and at the same time keep the roman s head above the surface the galley had passed leaving the two barely outside the stroke of its oars right through the ﬂoating men over heads helmeted well heads bare she drove in her wake nothing but the sea sparkling with ﬁre mufﬂed crash succeeded by great outcry made the rescuer look again from his charge certain savage pleasure touched his astroea was avenged after that the battle moved on resistance turned to ﬂight but who were the victors was sensible how much his freedom and the life of the tribune depended upon that event he pushed the plank under the latter until it ﬂoated him after which all his care was to keep him there the dawn came slowly he watched its growing hopefully yet sometimes afraid would it bring the romans or the pirates if the pirates his char ge was project gutenberg https last morning broke in full the air without breath off to the left he saw the land too far to think of attempting to make it here and there men were adrift like himself in spots the sea was blackened by charred and sometimes smoking fragments galley up long way was lying to with torn sail hanging from the tilted yard and the oars all idle still farther away he could discern moving specks which he thought might be ships in ﬂight or pursuit or they might be white birds an hour passed thus his anxiety increased if relief came not speedily arrius would die sometimes he seemed already dead he lay so still he took the helmet off and then with greater difﬁculty the cuirass the heart he found ﬂuttering he took hope at the sign and held on there was nothing to but wait and after the manner of his people pray project gutenberg https vi the throes of recovery from drowning are more painful than the drowning these arrius passed through and at length to hur s delight reached the point of speech gradually from incoherent questions to where he was and by whom and how he had been saved he reverted to the battle the doubt of the victory stimulated his faculties to full return result aided not little by long could be had on their frail support after while he became talkative our rescue i see depends upon the result of the ﬁght i see also what thou hast done to speak fairly thou hast saved my life at the risk of thy own i make the acknowledgment broadly and whatever cometh thou hast my thanks more than that if fortune doth but serve kindly and we get well out of this peril i will thee such favor becometh roman who hath power and opportunity to prove his gratitude yet yet it is to be seen if with thy good intent thou hast really done kindness or rather speaking to thy i would exact of thee promise to in certain event the greatest favor one man can of that let have thy pledge if the thing be not forbidden i will it replied arrius rested again art thou indeed son of hur the jew he next asked it is i have i knew thy judah drew himself nearer the tribune s voice was drew nearer and listened last he thought to hear of home i knew him and loved him arrius continued there was another pause during which something diverted the speaker s thought it can not be he proceeded that thou son of his hast not heard of cato and brutus they were very great men and never great in death in their dying they left this roman may not survive his art thou listening i hear it is custom of gentlemen in rome to wear ring there is one on my hand take it now he held the hand to judah who did he asked now put it on thine own did so the trinket hath its uses said arrius next i have property and money i am accounted rich even in rome i have family show the ring to my freedman who hath control in my absence you will ﬁnd him in villa near misenum tell him how it came to thee and ask anything or all he may have he will not refuse the demand if i live i will better by thee i will make thee free project gutenberg https thee to thy home and people or thou mayst give thyself to the pursuit that pleaseth thee most dost thou hear i could not choose but hear then pledge by the nay good tribune i am jew by thy god then or in the form most sacred to those of thy to what i tell thee now and i tell thee i am waiting let have thy noble arrius i am warned by thy manner to expect something of gravest concern tell thy wish wilt thou promise then that were to give the pledge blessed be the god of my fathers yonder cometh ship in what direction from the canst thou tell her nationality by outward signs my service hath been at the hath she ﬂag i can not see arrius remained quiet some time apparently in deep reﬂection does the ship hold this way yet he at length asked still this way look the ﬂag now she hath nor any other sign she hath sail set and is of three banks and cometh that is all i can say of her roman in triumph would have out many ﬂags she must be an enemy hear now said arrius becoming grave again hear while yet i may speak if the galley be pirate thy life is safe they may not give thee freedom they may put thee to the oar again but they will not kill thee on the other hand the tribune faltered perpol he continued resolutely i am too old to submit to dishonor in rome let them tell how quintus arrius became roman tribune went down with his ship in the midst of the foe this is what i would have thee if the galley prove pirate push from the plank and drown dost thou hear swear thou wilt i will not swear said ﬁrmly neither will i the deed the law which is to most binding tribune would make answerable thy life take back the ring took the seal from his take it back and all thy promises of favor in the event of delivery from this peril the judgment which sent to the oar life made slave yet i am not slave more am i thy freedman i am son of israel and this moment at least my own master take back the arrius remained passive thou wilt not judah continued not in anger then nor in any despite but to free myself from hateful obligation i will give thy gift to the sea see tribune project gutenberg https tossed the ring away arrius heard the splash where it struck and sank though he did not look thou hast done foolish thing he said foolish one placed thou art i am not dependent upon thee death life is thread i can break without thy help and if i what will become of thee men determined on death prefer it at the hands of others the reason that the soul which plato giveth us is rebellious at the thought of that is all if the ship be pirate i will escape from the world my mind is ﬁxed i am roman success and honor are all in all yet i would have served thee thou wouldst not the ring was the only witness of my will available in this situation we are both lost i will die regretting the victory and glory wrested from thou wilt live to die little later mourning the pious duties undone because of this folly i pity saw the consequences of his act more distinctly than before yet he did not falter in the three years of my servitude tribune thou wert the ﬁrst to look upon kindly there was another the voice dropped the eyes became humid and he saw plainly if it were then before him the face of the boy who helped him to drink by the old well at nazareth at least he proceeded thou wert the ﬁrst to ask who i was and if when i reached out and caught thee blind and sinking the last time i too had thought of the many ways in which thou couldst be useful to in my wretchedness still the act was not all selﬁsh this i pray you to believe moreover seeing god giveth to know the ends i dream of are to be wrought by fair means alone thing of conscience i would rather die with thee than be thy slayer my mind is ﬁrmly set thine though thou wert to offer all rome tribune and it belonged to thee to make the gift good i would not kill thee thy cato and brutus were little children compared to the hebrew whose law jew must obey but my request thy command would be of more weight and that would not move i have both became silent waiting looked often at the coming ship arrius rested with closed eyes indif ferent art thou sure she is an enemy asked i think so was the reply she stops and puts boat over the dost thou see her ﬂag is there other sign by which she may be known if roman if roman she hath helmet over the mast s then be of cheer i see the still arrius was not assured the men in the small boat are takin g in the people aﬂoat pirates are not they may need rowers arrius replied recurring possibly to times when he had made rescues the purpose was very watchful of the actions of the strangers the ship moves of f he project gutenberg https whither over on our right there is galley which i take to be deserted the heads towards it now she is alongside now she is sending men then arrius opened his eyes and threw of f his calm thank thou thy god he said to after look at the galleys thank thou thy god i my many gods pirate would sink not save yon ship by the act and the helmet on the mast i know roman the victory is mine fortune hath not deserted we are saved wave thy to them quickly i shall be duumvir and thou i knew thy father and loved him he was prince indeed he taught jew was not barbarian i will take thee with i will make thee my son give thy god thanks and call the sailors haste the pursuit must

were speedily taken up arrius was received on the galley with all the honors due hero so the favorite of fortune upon couch on the deck he heard the particulars of the conclusion of the ﬁght when the survivors aﬂoat upon the water were all saved and the prize secured he spread his ﬂag of commandant anew and hurried northward to rejoin the ﬂeet and perfect the victory in due time the ﬁfty vessels coming down the channel closed in upon the fugitive pirates and crushed them utterly not one escaped to swell the tribune s glory twenty galleys of the enemy were captured upon his return from the cruise arrius had warm welcome on the mole at misenum the young man attending him very early attracted the attention of his friends there and to their questions to who he was the tribune proceeded in the most affectionate manner to tell the story of his rescue and introduce the stranger omitting carefully all that pertained to the latter s previous history at the end of the narrative he called to him and said with hand resting af fectionately upon his shoulder good friends this is my son and heir who he is to take my it be the will of the gods that i leave be known to you by my name i pray you all to love him you love speedily opportunity permitted the adoption was formally perfected and in such manner the brave roman kept his faith with giving him happy introduction into the imperial world

far the most conspicuous and most admired were twenty prows complemented by their corresponding aplustra cut bodily from many galleys and over them so to be legible to the eighty thousand spectators

age had their origin in rome and spread thence throughout the empire that the great cities but reﬂected the manners of their mistress on the tiber this may be doubted the reaction of the conquest would seem to have been upon the morals of the conqueror in greece she found spring of corruption so also in egypt and the student having exhauste d the subject will close the books assured that the ﬂow of the demoralizing river was from the east westwardly and that this very city of antioch one of the oldest seats of assyrian power and splendor was principal source of the deadly stream transport galley entered the mouth of the river orontes from the blue waters of the sea it was in the forenoon the heat was great yet all on board who could avail themselves of the privilege were on among others the ﬁve years had brought the young jew to perfect manhood though the robe of white linen in which he was attired somewhat masked his form his appearance was unusually attractive an hour and more he had occupied seat in the shade of the sail and in that time several of his own nationality had tried to engage him in conversation but without avail his replies to their questions had been brief though gravely courteous and in the latin tongue the purity of his speech his cultivated manners his reticence served to stimulate their curiosity the more such observed him closely were struck by an incongruity between his demeanor which had the ease and grace of patrician and certain points of his person thus his arms were disproportionately long and when to steady himself against the motion of the vessel he took hold of anything near by the size of his hands and their evident power compelled remark so the wonder who and what he was mixed continually with wish to know the particulars of his life in other words his air can not be better described than man has story to tell the galley in coming had stopped at one of the ports of cyprus and picked up hebrew of most respectable appearance quiet reserved paternal ventured to ask him some questions the replies won his conﬁdence and resulted ﬁnally in an extended conversation it chanced also that the galley from cyprus entered the receiving bay of the orontes two other vessels which had been sighted out in the sea met it and passed into the river at the same time and they did so both the strangers threw out small ﬂags of brightest yellow there was much conje cture to the meaning of the signals at length passenger addressed himself to the respectable hebrew information upon the subject yes i know the meaning of the ﬂags he replied they not signify are merely marks of project gutenberg https has the owner many ships he you know him i have dealt with the passengers looked at the speaker if requesting him to go on listened with interest he lives in antioch the hebrew continued in his quiet way that he is vastly rich has brought him into notice and the talk about him is not always kind there used to be in jerusalem prince of very ancient family named hur judah strove to be composed yet his heart beat quicker the prince was merchant with genius business he set on foot many enterprises some reaching far east others west in the great cities he had branch houses the one in antioch was in charge of man said by some to have been family servant called simonides greek in name yet an israelite the master was drowned at sea his business however went on and was scarcely less prosperous after while misfortune overtook the family the prince s only son nearly grown tried to kill the procurator gratus in one of the streets of jerusalem he failed by narrow chance and has not since been heard of in fact the roman s rage took in the whole one of the name was left alive their palace was sealed up and is now rookery pigeons the estate was conﬁscated everything that could be traced to the ownership of the hurs was conﬁscated the procurator cured his hurt with golden the passengers laughed you mean he kept the property said one of them they say so the hebrew replied i am only telling story i received it and to go on simonides who had been the prince s agent here in antioch opened trade in short time on his own account and in space incredibly brief became the master merchant of the city in imitation of his master he sent caravans to india and on the sea at present he has galleys enough to make royal ﬂeet they say nothing goes amiss with him his camels not die except of old age his ships never founder if he throw chip into the river it will come back to him how long has he been going on thus not ten he must have had good yes they say the procurator took only the prince s property ready at horses cattle houses land vessels goods the money could not be found though there must have been vast sums of it what became of it has been an unsolved mystery not to said passenger with sneer i understand you the hebrew answered others have had your idea that it furnished old simonides his start is common belief the procurator is of that he has twice in ﬁve years he has caught the merchant and put him to judah gripped the rope he was holding with crushing force it is said the narrator continued that there is not sound bone in the man s body the last time i saw him he sat in chair shapeless cripple propped against project gutenberg https so tortured

most they wrung from him now however he is past persecution he has license to trade signed by tiberius he paid roundly it i these ships are his the hebrew continued passing the remark it is custom among his sailors to salute each other upon meeting by throwing out yellow ﬂags sight of which is much to say we have had fortunate the story ended there when the transport was fairly in the channel of the river judah spoke to the hebrew what was the name of the merchant s master prince of what became of the prince s family the boy was sent to the galleys i may say he is dead one year is the ordinary limit of life under that sentence the widow and daughter have not been heard of those who know what became of them will not speak they died doubtless in the cells of one of the castles which spot the waysides of judah walked to the pilot s quarter so absorbed was he in thought that he scarcely noticed the shores of the river which from sea to city were surpassingly beautifu l with orchards of all the syrian fruits and vines clustered about villas rich those of neapolis more did he observe the vessels passing in an endless ﬂeet nor hear the singing and shouting of the sailors some in labor some in merriment the sky was full of sunlight lying in hazy warmth upon the land and the water nowhere except over his life was there shadow once only he awoke to momentary interest and that was when some one pointed out the grove of daphne discernible from bend in the river project gutenberg https ii when the city came into view the passengers were on deck eager that nothing of the scene might escape them the respectable jew already introduced to the reader was the principal spokesman the river here runs to the west he said in the way of general answer i remember when it washed the base of the walls but roman subjects we have lived in peace and always happens in such times trade has had its will now the whole river front is taken up with wharves and docks yonder speaker pointed is mount casius or these people love to call it the mountains of orontes looking across to its brother amnus in the north and between them lies the plain of antioch farther on are the black mountains whence the ducts of the kings bring the purest water to wash the thirsty streets and people yet they are forests in wilderness state dense and full of birds and where is the lake one asked over north there you can take horse if you wish to see better boat tributary connects it with the river the grove of daphne he said to third inquirer nobody can describe it only beware it was begun by apollo and completed by him he prefers it to olympus people go there one never come away they have saying which tells it better be worm and feed on the mulberries of daphne than king s then you advise to stay away from it not i go you will everybody goes cynic philosopher virile boy women and go so sure am i of what you will that i assume to advise you not take quarters in the will be loss of time but go at once to the village in the edge of the grove the way is through garden under the spray of fountains the lovers of the god and his penaean maid built the town and in its porticos and paths and thousand retreats you will ﬁnd characters and habits and sweets and kinds elsewhere impossible but the wall of the city there it is the masterpiece of xeraeus the master of mural all eyes followed his pointing ﬁnger this part was raised by order of the ﬁrst of the seleucidæ three hundred years have made it part of the rock it rests the defense justiﬁed the encomium high solid and with many bold angles it curved southwardly out of view on the top there are four hundred towers each reservoir of water the hebrew continued look now over the wall tall it is see in the distance two hills which you may know the rival crests of sulpius the structure on the farthest one is the citadel garrisoned all the year round by rom an legion opposite it this way rises the temple of jupiter and under that the front of the legate s palace full of ofﬁces and yet fortress against which mob would dash harmlessly south project gutenberg https this point the sailors began taking in sail whereupon the hebrew exclaimed heartily see you who hate the sea and you who have vows get ready your curses and your prayers the bridge yonder over which the road to seleucia is carried marks the limit of navigation what the ship unloads further transit the camel takes up there above the bridge begins the island upon which calinicus built his new city connecting it with ﬁve great viaducts so solid time has made impression upon them nor ﬂoods nor earthquakes of the main town my friends i have only to say you will be happier all your lives having seen he concluded the ship turned and made slowly her wharf under the wall bringing even more fairly to view the life with which the river at that point was posses sed finally the lines were thrown the oars shipped and the voyage was done then sought the respectable hebrew let trouble you moment before saying the man bowed assent your story of the merchant has made curious to see him you called him simonides yes he is jew with greek where is he to be found the acquaintance gave sharp look before he answered i may save you mortiﬁcation he is not nor am i said smiling at the other s shrewdness the man raised his head and considered an instant one would think he then replied that the richest merchant in antioch would have house business corresponding to his wealth but if you would ﬁnd him in the day follow the river to yon bridge under which he quarters in building that looks like buttress of the wall before the door there is an immense landing always covered with cargoes come and to go the ﬂeet that lies moored there is his you can not fail to ﬁnd i give you the peace of our fathers go with and with with that they separated two loaded with his bagg age received s orders upon the wharf to the citadel he said direction which implied an ofﬁcial military connection two great streets cutting each other at right angles divided the city into quarters curious and immense structure called the nymphaeum arose at the foot of the one running north and south when the porters turned south there the though fresh from rome was amazed at the magniﬁcence of the avenue on the right and left there were palaces and between them extended indeﬁnitely double colonnades of marble leaving separate ways footmen beasts and chariots the whole under shade and cooled by fountains of incessant ﬂow was not in mood to enjoy the spectacle the story of simonides haunted him arrived at the monument of four arches wide the streets superbly illustrated and erected project gutenberg https by epiphanes the eighth of the suddenly changed his mind i will not go to the citadel he said to the porters take to the khan nearest the bridge on the road to the party faced about and in good time he was deposited in public house of primitive but ample construction within stone throw of the bridge under which old simonides had his quarters he lay upon the through the night in his inner mind lived the thought i will hear of and the dear little tirzah if they are on earth i will ﬁnd project gutenberg https iii next day early to the neglect of the city sought the house of simonides through an embattled gateway he passed to continuity of wharves thence up the river midst busy press to the seleucian bridge under which he paused to take in the scene there directly under the bridge was the merchant s house mass of gray stone unhewn referable to style looking the voyager had described it like buttress of the wall against which it leaned two immense doors in front communicated with the wharf some holes near the top heavily barred served windows weeds waved from the crevices and in places black moss splotched the otherwise bald stones the doors were open through one of them business went in through the other it came out and there was hurry hurry in all its movements on the wharf there were piles of goods in every kind of package and groups of slaves stripped to the waist going about in the abandon of labor below the bridge lay ﬂeet of galleys some loading others unloading yellow ﬂag blew out from each masthead from ﬂeet and wharf and from ship to ship the bondmen of trafﬁc passed in clamorous counter above the bridge across the river wall rose from the water s edge over which towered the fanciful cornices and turrets of an imperial palace covering every foot of the island spoken of in the hebrew s description but with all its suggestions scarcely noticed it now at last he thought to hear of his this certainly if simonides had indeed been his father s slave but would the man acknowledge the relation that would be to give up his riches and the sovereignty of trade so royally witnessed on the wharf and river and what was of still greater consequence to the merchant it would be to forego his career in the midst of amazing success and yield himself voluntarily once more slave simple thought of the demand seemed monstrous audacity stripped of diplomatic address it was to say you are my slave give all you have yet derived strength the interview from faith in his rights and the hope uppermost in his heart if the story to which he was yielding were true simonides belonged to him with all he had the wealth be it said in justice he cared nothing when he started to the door determined in mind it was with promise to let him tell of mother and tirzah and i will give him his freedom without he passed boldly into the house the interior was that of vast depot where in ordered spaces and under careful arrangement goods of every kind were heaped and pent though the light was murky and the air stiﬂing men moved about briskly and in places he saw workmen with saws and hammers making packages shipments down path between the piles he walked slowly wondering if the man of whose project gutenberg https were here such abounding proofs could have been his father s slave if so to what class had he belonged if jew was he the son of servant or was he debtor or debtor s son or had he been sentenced and sold theft these thoughts they passed in nowise disturbed the growin g respect the merchant of which he was each instant more and more conscious peculiarity of our admiration another is that it is always looking circumstances to justify itself at length man approached and spoke to him what would you have i would see simonides the will you come this way by number of paths left in the stowage they ﬁnally came to ﬂight of steps ascending which he found himself on the roof of the depot and in front of structur which can not be better described than lesser stone house built upon another invisible from the landing below and out west of the bridge under the open sky the roof hemmed in by low wall seemed like terrace which to his astonishment was brilliant with ﬂowers in the rich surrounding the house sat squat plain square block unbroken except by doorway in front dustless path led to the door through bordering of shrubs of persian rose in perfect bloom breathing sweet attar he followed the guide at the end of darkened passage withi n they stopped before curtain half parted the man called out stranger to see the master clear voice replied in god s name let him enter roman might have called the apartment into which the visitor was ushered his atrium the walls were paneled each panel was comparted like modern and each compartment crowded with labelled folios all ﬁlemot with age and use between the panels and above and below them were borders of wood once white now tinted like cream and carved with marvellous intricacy of design above cornice of gilded balls the ceiling rose in pavilion style until it broke into shallow dome set with hundreds of panes of violet mica permitting ﬂood of light deliciously reposeful the ﬂoor was carpeted with gray rugs so thick that an invading foot fell half buried and soundless in the midlight of the room were two man resting in chair and lined with pliant cushions and at his left leaning against the back of the chair girl well forward into womanhood at sight of them felt the blood redden his forehead bowing much to recover himself in respect he lost the lifting of the hands and the shiver and shrink with which the sitter caught sight of emotion swift to go it had been to come when he raised his eyes the two were in the same position except the girl s hand had fallen and was resting lightly upon the elder s shoulder both of them were regarding him ﬁxedly if you are simonides the merchant and jew stopped an then the peace of the god of our father abraham upon you the last word was addressed to the girl i am the simonides of whom you speak by birthright jew the man made answer in voice singula rly clear i am project gutenberg https jew and i return you your salutation with prayer to know who calls upon looked he listened and where the ﬁgure of the man should have been in healthful roundness there was only formless heap sunk in the depths of the cushions and covered by quilted robe of sombre silk over the heap shone head royally ideal head of statesman and head broad of base and domelike in front such angelo would have modelled cæsar white hair dropped in thin locks over the white brows deepening the blackness of the eyes shining through them like sullen lights the face was bloodless and much puffed with folds especially under the chin in other words the head and face were those of man who might move the world more readily than the world could move man to be twice twelve times tortured into the shapeless cripple he was without groan much less confession man to yield his life but never purpose or point man born in armor and assaila ble only through his loves to him stretched his hands open and palm up he would of fer peace at the same time he asked it i am judah son of ithamar late head of the house of hur and prince of the merchant s right hand lay outside the long thin hand articulate to deformity with suffering it closed tightly otherwise there was not the slightest expression of feeling of any kind on his part nothing to warrant an inference of surprise or interest nothing but this calm answer the princes of jerusalem of the pure blood are always welcome in my house you are welcome give the young man seat esther the girl took an ottoman near by and carried it to she arose from placing the seat their eyes met the peace of our lord with you she said modestly be seated and at when she resumed her place by the chair she had not divined his purpose the powers of woman go not so far if the matter is of ﬁner feeling such pity mercy sympathy that she detects and therein is difference between her and man which will endure long she remains by nature alive to such feelings she was simply sure he brought some wound of life healing did not take the offered seat but said deferentially i pray the good master simonides that he will not hold an intruder coming up the river yesterd ay i heard he knew my father i knew the prince hur we were associated in some enterprises lawful to merchants who ﬁnd proﬁt in lands beyond the sea and the desert but sit i pray esther some wine the young man nehemiah speaks of son of hur who once ruled the half part of jerusalem an old house very old by the faith in the days of moses and joshua even some of them found favor in the sight of the lord and divided honors with those princes among men it can hardly be that their descendant lineally come to us will refuse cup of of the genuine vine of sorek grown on the south of by the time of the conclusion of this speech esther was before with silver cup ﬁlled from vase upon table little removed from the chair she offered the drink with downcast project gutenberg https touched her hand gently to put it away again their eyes met whereat he noticed that she was small not nearly to his shoulder in height but very graceful and fair and sweet of face with eyes black and inexpressibly soft she is kind and pretty he thought and looks tirzah would were she living poor tirzah then he said aloud thy he is thy father paused i am esther the daughter of simonides she said with dignity then fair esther thy father when he has heard my further speech will not think worse of if yet i am slow to take his wine of famous extract nor less i hope not to lose grace in thy sight stand thou here with moment both of them in common cause turned to the merchant simonides he said ﬁrmly my father at his death had trusted servant of thy name and it has been told that thou art the man there was sudden start of the wrenched limbs under the robe and the thin hand clenched esther esther the man called sternly here not there thou art thy mother s child and not there i say the girl looked once from father to visitor then she replaced the cup upon the table and went dutifully to the chair her countenance sufﬁciently expressed her wonder and alarm simonides lifted his left hand and gave it into hers lying lovingly upon his shoulder and said dispassionately i have grown old in dealing with before my time if he who told thee that whereof thou speakest was friend acquainted with my history and spoke of it not harshly he must have persuaded thee that i could not be else than man distrustful of my kind the god of israel help him who at the end of life is constrained to acknowledge so much my loves are few but they are one of them is soul which carried the hand holding his to his lips in manner soul which to this time has been unselﬁshly mine and such sweet comfort that were it taken from i would esther s head drooped until her cheek touched his the other love is but memory of which i will say further that like benison of the lord it hath compass to contain whole family if only voice lowered and if only i knew where they s face suffused and advancing step he cried impulsively my mother and sister oh it is of them you speak esther if spoken to raised her head but simonides returned to his calm and answered coldly hear to the end because i am that i am and because of the loves of which i have spoken before i make return to thy demand touching my relations to the prince hur and something which of right should come ﬁrst thou show proofs of who thou art is thy witness in writing or cometh it in person the demand was plain and the right of it indisputable blushed clasped his hands stammered and turned away at loss simonides pressed him the proofs the proofs i say set them before them in my hands project gutenberg https had answer he had not anticipated the requirement and now that it was made to him never before came the awful fact that the three years in the galley had carried away all the proofs of his identity mother and sister gone he did not live in the knowledge of any human being many there were acquainted with him but that was all had quintus arrius been present what could he have said more than where he found him and that he believed the pretender to be the son of hur but will presently appear in full the brave roman sailor was dead judah had felt the loneliness before to the core of life the sense struck him now he stood hands clasped face averted in stupefaction simonides respected his suffering and waited in silence master simonides he said at length i can only tell my story and i will not that unless you stay judgment so long and with deign to hear speak said simonides now indeed master of the situation speak and i will listen the more willingly that i have not denied you to be the very person you claim proceeded then and told his life hurriedly yet with the feeling which is the source of all eloquence but we are familiar with it down to his landing at misenum in company with arrius returned victorious from the ægean at that point we will take up the words my benefactor was loved and trusted by the emperor who heaped him with honorable rewards the merchants of the east contributed magniﬁcent presents and he became doubly rich among the rich of rome may jew forget his religion or his birthplace if it were the holy land of our fathers the good man adopted his son by formal rites of law and i strove to make him just return child was ever more dutiful to father than i to him he would have had scholar in art philosophy rhetoric oratory he would have furnished the most famous teacher i declined his insistence because i was jew and could not forget the lord god or the glory of the prophets or the city set on the hills by david and solomon oh ask you why i accepted any of the benefactions of the roman i loved him next place i thought with his help array inﬂuences which would enable one day to unseal the mystery the fate of my mother and sister and to these there was yet another motive of which i shall not speak except to say it controlled so far that i devoted myself to arms and the acquisition of everything deemed essential to thorough knowledge of the art of war in the palaestrae and circuses of the city i toiled and in the camps less and in all of them i have name but not that of my fathers the crowns i won on the walls of the villa by misenum there are many of them came to the son of arrius the duumvir in that relation only am i known among romans in steadfast pursuit of my secret aim i left rome antioch intending to accompany the consul maxentius in the campaign he is organizing against the parthians master of personal skill in all arms i seek now the higher knowledge pertaining to the conduct of bodies of men in the ﬁeld the consul has admitted one of his military family but yesterday our ship entered the orontes two other ships sailed in with us ﬂying yellow ﬂags and countryman from cyprus explained that the vessels belonged to simonides the master of antioch he told us also who the project gutenberg https his marvellous success in commerce of his ﬂeets and caravans and their coming and going and not knowing i had interest in the theme beyond my associate listeners he said simonides was jew once the servant of the prince hur nor did he conceal the cruelties of gratus or the purpose of their at this allusion simonides bowed his head and if to help him conceal his feelings and her own deep sympathy the daughter hid her face on his neck directly he raised his eyes and said in clear voice i am good simonides then said advancing step his whole soul seeking expression i see thou art not convinced and that yet i stand in the shadow of thy the merchant held his features ﬁxed marble and his tongue still and not less clearly i see the difﬁculties of my position hur continued all my roman conne ction i can prove i have only to call upon the consul now the guest of the governor of the city but i can not prove the particulars of thy demand upon i can not prove i am my father s son they who could serve in they are dead or he covered his face with his hands whereupon esther arose and taking the rejected cup to him said the wine is of the country we all so love drink i pray thee the voice was sweet that of rebekah offering drink at the well near nahor the city he saw there were tears in her eyes and he drank saying daughter of simonides thy heart is full of goodness and merciful art thou to let the stranger share it with thy father be thou blessed of our god i thank then he addressed himself to the merchant again i have proof that i am my father s son i will withdraw that i demanded of thee simonides and go hence to trouble you more only let say i did not seek thy return to servitude nor account of thy fortune in any event i would have said now i say that all which is product of thy labor and genius is thine keep it in welcome i have need of any part thereof when the good quintus my second father sailed on the voyage which was his last he left his heir princely rich if therefore thou dost think of again be it with remembrance of this question which i swear by the prophets and jehovah thy god and mine was the chief purpose of my coming here what dost thou canst thou tell my mother and tirzah my who should be in beauty and grace even this one thy sweetness of life if not thy very life oh what canst thou tell of them the tears ran down esther s cheeks but the man was wilful in clear voice he replied i have said i knew the prince i remember hearing of the misfortune which overtook his family i remember the bitterness with which i heard it he who wrought such misery to the widow of my friend is the same who in the same spirit hath since wrought upon i will go furth er and say to you i have made diligent quest concerning the family have nothing to tell you of them they are uttered great project gutenberg https it is another hope broken he said struggling with his feelings i am used to disappointments i pray you pardon my intrusion and if i have occasioned you annoyance forgive it because of my sorrow i have nothing now to live but vengeance at the curtain he turned and said simply i thank you peace go with you the merchant said esther could not speak sobbing and so he project gutenberg https iv scarcely was gone when simonides seemed to wake from sleep his countenance ﬂushed the sullen light of his eyes changed to brightness and he said cheerily esther she went to the table and rang one of the panels in the wall swung back exposing doorway which gave admittance to man who passed round to the merchant s front and saluted him with malluch the chair the master said imperiously i have mission which shall not fail though the sun should hearken young man is now descending to the comely and in the garb of israel follow him his shadow not more faithful and every night send report of where he is what he does and the company he keeps and if without discovery you overhear his conversations report them word word together with whatever will serve to expose him his habits motives life understand you go quickly stay malluch if he leave the city go after mark you malluch be friend if he bespeak you tell him what you will to the occasion most suited except that you are in my service of that not word haste the man saluted before and was gone then simonides rubbed his wan hands together and laughed what is the day daughter he said in the midst of the mood what is the day i wish to remember it happiness come see and look it laughing and laughing tell esther the merriment seemed unnatural to her and if to entreat him from it she answered sorrowfully woe s father that i should ever get this day his hands fell down the instant and his chin dropping upon his breast lost itself in the mufﬂing folds of ﬂesh composing his lower face true most true my daughter he said without looking up this is the twentieth day of the fourth month ﬁve years ago my rachel thy mother fell down and died they brought home broken thou seest and we found her dead of grief oh to she was cluster of camphire in the vineyards of i have gathered my myrrh with my spice i have eaten my honeycomb with my honey we laid her away in lonely tomb cut in the mountain one near her yet in the darkness she left little light which the years have increased to brightness of he raised his hand and rested it upon his daughter s head dear lord i thank thee that now in my esther my lost rachel liveth again directly he lifted his head and said with sudden thought is it not clear day outside it was when the young man came project gutenberg https then let abimelech come and take to the garden where i can see the river and the ships and i will tell thee dear esther why but now my mouth ﬁlled with laughter and my tongue with singing and my spirit was like to roe or to young hart upon the mountains of in answer to the bell servant came and at her bidding pushed the chair set on little wheels the purpose out of the room to the roof of the lower house called by him his garden out through the roses and by beds of lesser ﬂowers all triumphs of careful attendance but now unnoticed he was rolled to position from which he could view the over against him on the island the bridge in lessening perspective to the farther shore and the river below the bridge crowded with vessels all swimming amidst the dancing splendors of the early sun upon the rippling water there the servant left him with esther the much shouting of laborers and their beating and pounding did not disturb him any more than the tramping of people on the bridge ﬂoor almost overhead being familiar to his ear the view before him to his eye and therefore unnoticeable except suggestions of proﬁts in promise esther sat on the arm of the chair nursing his hand and waiting his speech which came at length in the calm way the mighty will having carried him back to himself when the young man was speaking esther i observed thee and thought thou wert won by her eyes fell she replied speak you of faith father i believed in thy eyes then he is the lost son of the prince hur if he is she hesitated and if he is not esther i have been thy handmaiden father since my mother answered the call of the lord god by thy side i have heard and seen thee deal in wise ways with all manner of men seeking proﬁt holy and unholy and now i say if indeed the young man be not the prince he claims to be then before falsehood never played so well the part of righteous by the glory of solomon daughter thou speakest earnestly dost thou believe thy father his father s servant i understood him to ask of that something he had but time simonides gaze swam among his swimming ships though they had place in his mind well thou art good child esther of genuine jewish shrewdness and of years and strength to hear sorrowful tale wherefore give heed and i will tell you of myself and of thy mother and of many things pertaining to the past not in thy knowledge or thy withheld from the persecuting romans hope s sake and from thee that thy nature should grow towards the lord straight the reed to the sun i was born in tomb in the valley of hinnom on the south side of zion my father and mother were hebrew tenders of the ﬁg and olive trees growing with many vines in the king s garden hard by siloam and in my boyhood i helped them they were of the class bound to serve forever they sold to the prince hur then next to herod the king the richest man in jerusalem from the garden he transferred to his storehouse in alexandria project gutenberg https where i came of age i served him six years and in the seventh by the law of moses i went esther clapped her hands lightly oh then thou art not his father s servant nay daughter hear now in those days there were lawyers in the cloisters of the temple who disputed vehemently saying the children of servants bound forever took the condition of their parents but the prince hur was man righteous in all things and an interpreter of the law after the straites t sect though not of them he said i was hebrew servant bought in the true meaning of the great lawgiver and by sealed writings which i yet have he set and my mother esther asked thou shalt hear all esther be patient before i am through thou shalt see it were easier to forget myself than thy mother at the end of my service i came up to jerusalem to the passover my master entertained i was in love with him already and i prayed to be continued in his service he consented and i served him yet another seven years but hired son of israel in his behalf i had charge of ventures on the sea by ships and of ventures on land by caravans eastward to susa and persepolis and the lands of silk beyond them perilous passages were they my daughter but the lord blessed all i undertook i brought home vast gains the prince and richer knowledge myself without which i could not have mastered the charges since fallen to one day i was guest in his house in jerusalem servant entered with some sliced bread on platter she came to ﬁrst it was then i saw thy mother and loved her and took her away in my secret heart after while time came when i sought the prince to make her my wife he told she was forever but if she wished he would set her free that i might be gratiﬁed she gave love love but was happy where she was and refused her freedom i prayed and besought going again and again after long intervals she would be my wife she all the time said if i would become her fellow in servitude our father jacob served yet other seven years his rachel could i not much mine but thy mother said i must become she to serve forever i came away but went back look esther look he pulled out the lobe of his left ear see you not the scar of the awl i see it she said and oh i see how thou didst love my mother love her esther she was to more than the shulamite to the singing king fairer more spotless fountain of gardens well of living waters and streams from lebanon the master even i required him took to the judges and back to his door and thrust the awl through my ear into the door and i was his servant forever so i won my rachel and was ever love like mine esther stooped and kissed him and they were silent thinking of the dead my master was drowned at sea the ﬁrst sorrow that ever fell upon the merchant continued there was mourning in his house and in mine here in antioch my at the time now esther mark you when the good prince was lost i had risen to be his chief steward with everything of property belonging project gutenberg https in my management and control judge you how much he loved and trusted i hastened to jerusalem to render account to the widow she continued in the stewardship i applied myself with greater diligence the business prospered and grew year by year ten years passed then came the blow which you heard the young man tell accident he called it to the procurator gratus the roman gave it out an attempt to assassinate him under that pretext by leave from rome he conﬁscated to his own use the immense fortune of the widow and children nor stopped he there that there might be reversal of the judgment he removed all the parties interested from that dreadful day to this the family of hur have been lost the son whom i had seen child was sentenced to the galleys the widow and daughter are supposed to have been buried in some of the many dungeons of judea which once closed upon the doomed are like sepulchers sealed and locked they passed from the knowledge of men utterly if the sea had swallowed them unseen we could not hear how they not even that they were esther s eyes were dewy with tears thy heart is good esther good thy mother s was and i pray it have not the fate of most good be trampled upon by the unmerciful and blind but heark en further i went up to jerusalem to give help to my benefactress and was seized at the gate of the city and carried to the sunken cells of the tower of antonia why i knew not until gratus himself came and demanded of the moneys of the house of hur which he knew after our jewish custom of exchange were subject to my draft in the different marts of the world he required to sign to his order i refused he had the houses lands goods ships and movable property of those i served he had not their moneys i saw if i kept favor in the sight of the lord i could rebuild their broken fortunes i refused the tyrant s demands he put to torture my will held good and he set free nothing gained i came home and began again in the name of simonides of antioch instead of the prince hur of jerusalem thou knowest esther how i have prospered that the increase of the millions of the prince in my hands was miraculous thou knowest how at the end of three years while going up to cæsarea i was taken and second time tortured by gratus to compel confession that my goods and moneys were subject to his order of conﬁscation thou knowest he failed before broken in body i came home and found my rachel dead of fear and grief the lord our god reigned and i lived from the emperor himself i bought immunity and license to trade throughout the world be he who maketh the clouds his chariot and walketh upon the winds esther that which was in my hands stewardship is multiplied into talents sufﬁcient to enrich cæsar he lifted his head proudly their eyes met each read the other s thought what shall i with the treasure esther he asked without lowering his gaze my father she answered in low voice did not the rightful owner call it but now still his look did not fail and thou my child shall i leave thee beggar nay father am not i because i am thy child his and of whom was it written strength and honor are her project gutenberg https she shall rejoice in time to come gleam of ineffable love lighted his face he said the lord hath been good to in many ways but thou esther art the sovereign excellence of his favor he drew her to his breast and kissed her many times hear now he said with clearer hear now why i laughed this morning the young man faced the apparition of his father in comely youth my spirit arose to salute him i felt my were over and my labors ended hardly could i keep from crying out i longed to take him by the hand and show the balance i had earned and say lo tis all thine and i am thy servant ready now to be called away and so i would have done esther so i would have done but that moment three thoughts rushed to restrain i will be sure he is my master s was the ﬁrst thought if he is my master s son i will learn somewhat of his nature of those born to riches bethink you esther how many there are in whose hands riches are but breeding curses paused while his hands clutched and his voice shrilled with esther consider the pains i endured at the roman s hands nay not gratus s alone the merciless wretches who did his bidding the ﬁrst time and the last were romans and they all alike laughed to hear scream consider my broken body and the years i have gone shorn of my stature consider thy mother yonder in her lonely tomb crushed of soul i of body consider the sorrows of my master s family if they are living and the cruelty of their f if they are dead consider all and with heaven s love about thee tell daughter shall not hair fall or red drop run in expiation tell not the preachers sometimes not that vengea nce is the lord does he not work his will harmfully well in love by agencies has he not his

to the many he had already met in the quest his people and the idea was depressing exactly in proportion the objects of his quest were dear to him it curtained him round about with sense of utter loneliness on earth which more than anything else serves to eke from soul cast down its remaining interest in life through the people and the piles of goods he made way to the edge of the landing and was tempted by the cool shadows darkening the river s depth the lazy current seemed to stop and wait him in counteraction of the spell the saying of the voyager ﬂashed into better be worm and feed upon the mulberries of daphne than king s he turned and walked rapidly down the landing and back to the khan the road to daphne the steward said surprised at the question put to him you have not been here before well count this the happiest day of your life you can not mistake the road the next street to the left going south leads straight to mount sulpius crowned by the altar of jupiter and the

multitude mixed of people from all the trading nations of the earth it was about the fourth hour of the day when he passed out the gate and found himself one of procession apparently interminable moving to the famous grove the road was divided into separate ways footmen men on horses and men in chariots and those again into separate ways outgoers and incomers the lines of division were guarded by low balustrading broken by massive pedestals many of which were surmounted with statuary right and left of the road extended margins of sward perfectly kept relieved at intervals by groups of oak and sycamore trees and summer the accommodation of the weary of whom on the return side there were always multitudes the ways of the footmen were paved with red stone and those of the riders strewn with white sand compactly rolled but not so solid to give back an echo to hoof or wheel the number and variety of fountains at play were amazing all gifts of visiting kings and called after them out southwest to the gates of the grove the magniﬁcent thoroughfare stretched little over four miles from the city in his wretchedness of feeling barely observed the royal liberality which marked the construction of the road nor more did he at ﬁrst notice the crowd going with him he treated the processional displays with like indifference to say truth besides his he had not little of the complacency of project gutenberg https visiting the provinces fresh from the ceremonies which daily eddied round and round the golden pillar set up by augustus the centre of the world it was not possible the provinces to offer anything new or superior he rather availed himself of every opportunity to push forward through the companies in the way and too his impatience by the time he reached heracleia suburban village intermediate the city and the grove he was somewhat spent with exercise and began to be susceptible of entertainment once pair of goats led by beautiful woman woman and goats alike brilliant with ribbons and ﬂowers attracted his attention then he stopped to look at bull of mighty girth and snowy white covered with vines freshly cut and bearing on its broad back naked child in baske t the image of young bacchus squeezing the juice of ripened berries into goblet and drinking with libational formulas he resumed his walk he wondered whose altars would be enriched by the offerings horse went by with clipped mane after the fashion of the time his rider superbly dressed he smiled to observe the harmony of pride between the man and the brute often after that he turned his head at hearing the rumble of wheels and the dull thud of hoofs unconsciously he was becoming interested in the styles of chariots and charioteers they rustled past him going and coming nor was it long until he began to make notes of the people around him he saw they were of all ages sexes and conditions and all in holiday attire one company was unifo rmed in white another in black some

quarrels if fate were something tangible to be despatched with look or blow or speaking personage with whom high words were possible then the unhappy mortal would not always end the af fair by punishing himself in ordinary mood would not have come to the grove alone or coming alone he would have availed himself of his position in the consul s family and made provision against wandering idly

where they were going yet to relieve him from absolute indifference he had vague impression that they were in movement to the temples which were the central objects of the grove supreme in attractions presently singers dreamfully play with ﬂitting chorus he began repeating to himself better be worm and feed on the mulberries of daphne than king s then of the much repetition arose questions importunate of answer was life in the grove so very sweet wherein was the charm did it lie in some tangled depth of philosophy or was it something in fact something on the surface discernible to wakeful senses every year thousands forswearing the world gave themselves to service here did they ﬁnd the charm and was it sufﬁcient when found to induce forgetfulness profound enough to shut out of mind the inﬁnitely diverse things of life those that sweeten and those that embitter hopes hovering in the near future well sorrows born of the past if the grove were so good them why should it not be good him he was jew could it be that the excellences were all the world but children of abraham forthwith he bent all his faculties to the task of discovery unmindful of the singing of the and the

over them the jasmine stretched its delicate bonds from lilac and rose and lily and tulip from oleander and all old friends in the gardens of the valleys about the city of david the air lingering or in haste loaded itself with exhalations day and night and that nothing might be wanting to the happiness of the nymphs and naiads down through the ﬂower shadows of the mass brook went its course gently and by many winding ways out of the thicket he proceeded on his right and left issued the cry of the pigeon and the cooing of blackbirds waited him and bided his coming close nightingale kept its place fearless though he passed in arm quail ran before him at his feet whistling to the brood she was leading and he paused them to get out of his way ﬁgure crawled from bed of honeyed musk brilliant with balls of golden blossoms was startled had he indeed been permitted to see satyr at home the creature looked up at him and showed in its teeth hooked he smiled at his own scare and lo the charm was evolved peace without universal it was he sat upon the ground beneath which spread its gray roots sprawling to receive branch of the brook the nest of titmouse hung close to the bubbling water and the tiny creature looked out of the door of the nest into his eyes verily the bird is interpreting to he thought it says i am not afraid of you the law of this happy place is the charm of

contentedly here they had could not have had but god of israel he cried aloud springing to his feet with burning mother tirzah curs ed be the moment cursed the place in which i yield myself happy in your loss he hurried away through the thicket and came to stream ﬂowing with the volume of river between banks of masonry broken at intervals by gated sluiceways bridge carried the path he was traversing across the stream and standing upon it he saw other bridges two of them alike under him the water was lying in deep pool clear shadow down little way it tumbled with roar over rocks then there was another pool and another cascade and so on out of view and bridges and pools project gutenberg https cascades said plainly inarticulate things can tell story the river was running by permission of master exactly the master would have it tractable became servant of the gods forward from the bridge he beheld landscape of wide valleys and irregular heights with groves and lakes and fanciful houses linked together by white paths and shining streams the valleys were spread below that the river might be poured upon them refreshment in days of drought and they were green carpets ﬁgured with beds and ﬁelds of ﬂowers and ﬂecked with ﬂocks of sheep white balls of snow and the voices of shepherds following the ﬂocks were heard afar if to tell him of the pious inscription of all he beheld the altars out under the open sky seemed countless each with ﬁgure attending it while processions in white went slowly hither and thither between them and the smoke of the altars isen hung collected in pale clouds over the devoted places here there happy in ﬂight intoxicated in pause from object to object point to point now in the meadow now on the heights now lingering to penetrate the groves and observe the processions then lost in efforts to pursue the paths and streams which trended mazily into dim perspectives to end ﬁnally ah what might be ﬁtting end to scene so beautiful what adequate mysteries were hidden behind an introduction so marve llous here and there the speech was beginning his gaze wandered so he could not help the conviction forced by the view and the sum of it all that there was peace in the air and on the earth and invitation everywhere to come and lie down here and be at rest suddenly revelation dawned upon grove was in fact far temple never anything like it the architect had not stopped to pother about columns and porticos proportions or interiors or any limitation upon the epic he sought to materialize he had simply made servant of nature can go

shepherd was girl and she beckoned him come farther on the path was divided by an pedestal of black gneiss capped with slab of white marble deftly foliated and on that brazier of bronze holding ﬁre close by it woman seeing him waved wand of willow and he passed called him stay and the temptation in her smile was that of passionate youth on yet further he met one of the processions at its head troop of little girls nude except they were covered with garlands piped their shrill voices into song then troop of boys also nude their bodies deeply came dancing to the song of the girls behind them the procession all women bearing baskets of spices and sweets to the clad in simple robes careless of exposure he went by they held their hands to him and said stay and go with one greek sang verse from anacreon i take or give i drink and live project gutenberg https i beg or borrow who knows about the silent morrow but he pursued his way indifferent and came next to grove luxuriant in the heart of the vale at the point where it would be most attractive to the observing eye it came close to the path he was travelling there was seduction in its shade and through the foliage he caught the shining of what appeared pretentious statue so he turned aside and entered the cool retreat the grass was fresh and clean the trees did not crowd each other and they were of every kind native to the east blended well with strangers adopted from far quarters here grouped in exclusive companionship plumed like queens there sycamores overtopping laurels of darker foliage and evergreen oaks rising verdantly with cedars vast enough to be kings on lebanon and mulberries and terebinths so beautiful it is not hyperbole to speak of them blown from the orchards of paradise the statue proved to be daphne of wondrous beauty hardly however had he time to more than glance at her face at the base of the pedestal girl and youth were lying upon tiger s skin asleep in each other s arms close by them the implements of their axe and sickle her carelessly upon heap of fading roses the exposure startled him back in the hush of the perfumed thicket he discovered he thought that the charm of the great grove was peace without fear and almost yielded to it now in this sleep in the day s broad sleep at the feet of he read further chapter to which only the vaguest allusion is sufferable the law of the place was love but love without law and this was the sweet peace of daphne this the life s end of her ministers this kings and princes gave of their revenues this crafty priesthood subordinated birds and brooks and lilies the river the labor of many hands the sanctity of altars the fertile power of the sun it would be pleasant now to record that pursued his walk assailed by such reﬂections he yielded somewhat to sorrow the votaries of the great outdoor temple especially those who by personal service kept it in state so surpassingly lovely how they came to the condition was not any longer mystery the motive the inﬂuence the inducement were before him some there were doubt caught by the promise held out to their troubled spirits of endless peace in consecrated abode to the beauty of

upon upright javelins the accommodation of spectators and such had interests reaching forward of the mere practise there were several stands shaded by substantial awnings and provided with seats in rising rows in one of the stands the two found places counted the chariots they went in all i commend the fellows he said with here in the east i thought they aspired to nothing better than the two

the old man s friends planted themselves between him and the horses an opportune failure of breath on his part helped the stratagem thinking he comprehended the sheik sympathized with him far more than mere pride of than anxiety the result of the his view it was within the possible the patriarch according to his habits of thought and his ideas of the inestimable to love such animals with tenderness akin to the most sensitive passion they were all bright bays unspotted perfectly matched and so proportioned to seem less than they really were delicate ears pointed small heads the faces were broad and full between the eyes the nostrils in expansion disclosed membrane so deeply red to suggest the ﬂashing of ﬂame the necks were arches overlaid with ﬁne mane so abundant to drape the shoulders and breast while in happy consonance the foreloc ks were like ravellings of silken veils between the knees and the fetlocks the legs were ﬂat an open hand but above the knees they were rounded with mighty muscles needful to upbear the shapely bodies the hoofs were like cups of polished agate and in rearing and plunging they whipped the air and sometimes the earth with tails and thick and long the sheik spoke of them the priceless and it was good project gutenberg https this second and closer look at the horses read the story of their relation to their master they had grown

they might win him triumph over the haug hty and hated roman the old man had brought his loves to the city never doubting they would win if only he could ﬁnd trusty expert to take them in hand not merely one with skill but of spirit which their spirits would acknowledge unlike the colder people of the west he could not protest the driver s inability and dismiss him civilly an arab and sheik he had to explode and rive the air about him with clamor before the patriarch was done with his expletives dozen hands were at the bits of the horses and their quiet assured about that time another chariot appeared upon the track and unlike the others driver vehicle and races were precisely they would be presented in the circus the day of ﬁnal trial reason which will presently be more apparent it is desirable now to give this turnout plainly to the reader there should be difﬁculty in understanding the carriage known to us all the chariot of classical renown one has but to picture to himself dray with low wheels and broad axle surmounted by box open at the tail end such was the primitive pattern artistic genius came along in time and touching the rude machine raised it into thing of instance in which aurora riding in advance of the dawn is given to our fancy the jockeys of the ancients quite shrewd and ambitious their successors of the present called their humblest turnout two and their best in grade four in the latter they contested the olympics and the other festal shows founded in imitation of them the same sharp gamesters preferred to put their horses to the chariot all abreast and distinction they termed the two next the pole and those on the right and left outside mates it was their judgment also that by allowing the fullest freedom of action the greatest speed was attainable accordingly the harness resorted to was peculiarly simple in fact there was nothing of it save collar round the animal s neck and trace ﬁxed to the collar unless the lines and halter fall within the term wanting to hitch up the masters pinned narrow wooden yoke or near the end of the pole and by straps passed through rings at the end of the yoke buckled the latter to the collar the traces of the yokesteeds they hitched to the axle those of the mates to the top rim of the there remained then but the adjustment of the lines which judged by the modern devices was not the least curious part of the method this there was large ring at the forward extremity of the pole securing the ends to that ring ﬁrst they parted the lines so to give one to each horse and proceeded to pass them to the driver slipping them separately through rings on the inner side of the halters at the mouth with this plain generalization in mind all further desirable knowledge upon the subject can be had by following the incidents of the scene occurring the other contestants had been receiv ed in silence the last comer was more fortunate while movi ng towards the stand from which we are viewing the scene his progress was signalized project gutenberg https demonstrations by clapping of hands and cheers the effect of which was to centre attention upon him exclusively his steeds it was observed were black while the were in conformity to the exacting canons of roman taste they had all four been mutilated that is to say their tails had been clipped and to complete the barbarity their shorn manes were divided into knots tied with ﬂaring red and yellow ribbons in advancing the stranger at length reached point where the chariot came into view from the stand and its appearance would of itself have justiﬁed the shouting the wheels were very marvels of construction stout bands of burnished bronze reinforced the hubs otherwise very light the spokes were sections of ivory tusks set in with the natural curve outward to perfect the dishing considered important then now bronze tires held the fellies which were of shining ebony the axle in keeping with the wheels was tipped with heads of snarling tigers done in brass and the bed was woven of willow wands gilded with gold the coming of the beautiful horses and resplendent chariot drew to look at the driver with increased interest who was he when asked himself the question ﬁrst he could not see the man s face or even his full ﬁgure yet the air and manner were familiar and pricked him keenly with reminder of period long gone who could it be nearer now and the horses approach ing at trot from the shouting and the gorgeousness of the turnout it was thought he might be some ofﬁcial favorite or famous prince such an appearance was not inconsistent with exalted rank kings often struggled the crown of leaves which was the prize of victory nero and commodus it will be remembered devoted themselves to the chariot arose and forced passage down nearly to the railing in front of the lower seat of the stand his face was earnest his manner eager and directly the whole person of the driver was in view companion rode with him

clapping of hands were received with statuesque indifference stood instinct and memory had served him driver was messala by the selection of horses the magniﬁcence of the chariot the attitude and

satisfaction to him he promiseth enrichment forever the city and in the circuses and wherever the strong most congregate tell ye this his offer so saith my master sheik ilderim the the proclamation awakened great buzz among the people under the awning by night it would be repeated and discussed in all the sporting circles of antioch hearing it stopped and looked hesitatingly from the herald to the sheik malluch thought he was about to accept the offer but was relieved when he presently turned to him and asked good malluch where to now the worthy replied with laugh would you liken yourself to others visiting the grove the ﬁrst time you will straightway to hear your fortune my fortune said you though the suggestion has in it ﬂavor of unbelief let us to the goddess at nay son of arrius

to go to the temples the temples are greek are they not they call them the hellenes were masters of the beautiful in art but in architecture they sacriﬁced variety to unbending beauty their temples are all alike how call you the fountain oh it has repute throughout the world let us thither malluch kept watch on his companion they went and saw that the moment at least his good spirits were out to the people passing he gave attention over the wonders they came upon there were exclamations silently even sullenly he kept slow pace the truth was the sight of messala had set to thinking it seemed scarce an hour ago that the strong hands had torn him from his mother scarce an hour ago that the roman had put seal upon the gates of his father s house he recounted how in the hopeless misery of the such it might be project gutenberg https he had had little else to aside from labor than dream dreams of vengeance in all of which messala was the principal there might be he used to say to himself escape gratus but and to strengthen and harden his resolution he was accustomed to repeat over and over who pointed us out to the persecutors and when i begged him myself mocked and went away laughing and always the dream had the same ending the day i meet him help thou good god of my people to some ﬁtting special vengeance and now the meeting was at hand perhaps if he had found messala poor and suffering s feeling had been different but it was not so he found him more than prosperous in the prosperity there was dash and gleam of sun on gilt of gold so it happened that what malluch accounted passing loss of spirit was pondering when the meetin g should be and in what manner he could make it most memorable they turned after while into an avenue of oaks where the people were going and coming in groups footmen here and horsemen there women in litters borne slaves and now and then chariots rolled by thunderously at the end of the avenue the road by an easy grade descended into

money and gave the party in exchange leaf of papyrus the receiver made haste to plunge the papyrus into the basin then holding the dripping leaf in the sunlight he would be rewarded with versiﬁed inscription upon its face and the fame of the fountain seldom suffered loss by poverty of merit in the poetry before could test the oracle some other visitors were seen approaching across the meadow and their appearance piqued the curiosity of the company his not less than theirs he saw ﬁrst camel very tall and very white in leading of driver on horseback houdah on the animal besides being unusually large was of crimson and gold two other horsemen followed the camel with tall spears in hand what wonderful camel said one of the company prince from afar another one suggested more likely if he were on an elephant i would say he was third man had very dif ferent project gutenberg https white camel he said authoritatively by apollo friends they who come can see there are two of neither kings nor princes they are women in the midst of the dispute the strangers arrived the camel seen at hand did not belie his appearance afar taller statelier brute of his kind traveller at the fountain though from the remotest parts had ever beheld such great black eyes such exceedingly ﬁne white hair feet so contractile when raised so soundless in planting so broad when set had ever seen the peer of this camel and how well he became his housing of silk and all its frippery of gold in fringe and gold in tassel the tinkling of silver bells went before him and he moved lightly if unknowing of his burden but who were the man and woman under the houdah every eye saluted them with the inquiry if the former were prince or king the philosophers of the crowd might not deny the impartiality of time when they saw the thin shrunken face buried under an immense turban the skin of the hue of mummy making it imposs ible to form an idea of his nationality they were pleased to think the limit of life was the great well the small they saw about his person nothing so enviable the shawl which draped him the woman was seated in the manner of the east amidst veils and laces of surpassing ﬁneness above her elbows she wore armlets fashioned like coiled asps and linked to bracelets at the wrists by strands of gold otherwise the arms were bare and of singular natural grace complemented with hands modelled daintily child one of the hands rested upon the side of the carriage showing tapered ﬁngers glittering with rings and stained at the tips till they blushed like the pink of mother she wore an open caul upon her head sprinkled with beads of coral and strung with called sunlets some of which were carried across her forehead while others fell down her back in the mass of her straight hair of itself an incomparable ornament not needing the veil which covered it except protection against sun and dust from her elevated seat she looked upon the people calmly pleasantly and apparently so intent upon studying them to be unconscious of the interest she herself was exciting and what was in violent contravention of the custom among women of rank in looked at them with an open face it was fair face to see quite youthful in form oval complexion not white like the greek nor brunet like the roman nor blond like the gaul but rather the tinting of the sun of the upper nile upon skin of such transpa rency that the blood shone through it on cheek and brow with nigh the ruddiness of lamplight the eyes naturally large were touched along the lids with the black paint immemorial throughout the east the lips were slightly parted disclosing through their scarlet lake teeth of glistening whiteness to all these excellences of countenance the reader is ﬁnally besought to superadd the air derived from the pose of small head classic in shape set upon neck long drooping and air we may fancy happ ily described by the word queenly if satisﬁed with the survey of peop le and locality the fair creature spoke to the ethiopian of vast brawn naked project gutenberg https led the camel nearer the fountain and caused it to kneel after which he received from her hand cup and proceeded to ﬁll it at the basin that instant the sound of wheels and the trampling of horses in rapid motion broke the silence her beauty had imposed and with great outcry the bystanders parted in every direction hurrying to get away the roman has mind to ride us down look out malluch shouted to setting him at the same time an example of hasty ﬂight the latter faced to the direction the sounds came from and beheld messala in his chariot pushing the four straight at the crowd this time the view was near and distinct the parting of the company uncovered the camel which might have been more agile than his kind generally yet the hoofs were almost upon him and he resting with closed eyes chewing the endless cud with such sense of security long favoritism may be supposed to have bred in him the ethiopian wrung his hands afraid in the houdah the old man moved to escape but he was hampered with age and could not even in the face of danger forget the dignity which was plainly his habit it was too late the woman to save herself stood nearest them and he called to messala hold look where thou goest back back the patrician was laughing in hearty and seeing there was but one chance of rescue stepped in and caught the bits of the left and his mate dog of roman carest thou so little life he cried putting forth all his strength the two horses reared and drew the others round the tilting of the pole tilted the chariot messala barely escaped fall while his complacent myrtilus rolled back like clod to the ground seeing the peril past all the bystanders burst into derisive laughter the matchless audacity of the roman then manifested itself loosing the lines from his body he tossed them to one side dismounted walked round the camel looked at and spoke partly to the old man and partly to the woman pardon i pray pray you both i am messala he said and by the old mother of the earth i swear i did not see you or your camel to these good i trusted too much to my skill i sought laugh at laugh is theirs good may it them the careless look and gesture he threw the bystanders accorded well with the speech to hear what more he had to say they became quiet assured of victory over the body of the offended he signed his companion to take the chariot to safer distance and addressed himself boldly to the woman thou hast interest in the good man here whose pardon if not granted now i shall seek with the greater diligence hereafter his daughter i should say she made him reply by pallas thou art beautiful beware apollo mistake thee not his lost love i wonder what land can boast herself thy mother turn not away truce truce there is the sun of india in thine eyes in the corners of thy mouth egypt hath set her project gutenberg https turn not to that slave fair mistress before proving merciful to this one tell at least that i am at this point she broke in upon him wilt thou come here she asked smiling and with gracious bend of the head to take the cup and ﬁll it i pray thee she said to the latter my father is thirsty i am thy most willing servant turned about to the favor and was face to face with messala their glances met the jew s deﬁant the roman s sparkling with humor stranger beautiful cruel messala said waving his hand to her if apollo get thee not thou shalt see again not knowing thy country i can not name god to commend thee to so by all the gods i will commend thee seeing that myrtilus had the four composed and ready he returned to the chariot the woman looked after him he moved away and whatever else there was in her look there was displeasure presently she received the water her father drank then she raised the cup to her lips and leaning down gave it to never action more graceful and gracious keep it we pray of thee it is full of thine immediately the camel was aroused and on his feet and about to go when the old man called stand thou went to him respectfully thou hast served the stranger well there is but one god in his holy name i thank thee i am balthasar the egyptian in the great orchard of palms beyond the village of daphne in the shade of the palms sheik ilderim the generous abideth in his tents and we are his guests seek us there thou shalt have welcome sweet with the savor of the was left in wonder at the old man s clear voice and reverend manner he gazed after the two departing he caught sight of messala going he had come joyous indifferent and with mocking project gutenberg https ix rule there is surer way to the dislike of men than to behave well where they have behaved badly in this instance happily malluch was an exception to the rule the affair he had just witnessed raised in his estimation since he could not deny him courage and address could he now get some insight into the young man s history the results of the day would not be all unproﬁtable to good master simonides on the latter point referring to what he had yet learned two facts comprehended it subject of his investigation was jew and the adopted son of famous roman another conclusion which might be of importance was beginning to formulate itself in the shrewd mind of the emissary between messala and the son of the duumvir there was connection of some kind but what was it how could it be reduced to assura nce with all his sounding the ways and means of solution were not at call in the heat of the perplexity himself came to his help he laid his hand on malluch s arm and drew him out of the crowd which was already going back to its interest in the gray old priest and the mystic fountain good malluch he said stopping may man forget his mother the question was abrupt and without direction and therefore of the kind which leaves the person addressed in state of confusion malluch looked into s face hint of meaning but saw instead two spots one on each cheek and in his eyes traces of what might have been repressed tears then he answered mechanically adding with fervor never and moment after when he began to recover himself if he is an israelite never and when at length he was completely my ﬁrst lesson in the synagogue was the shema my next was the saying of the son of sirach honor thy father with thy whole soul and get not the sorrows of thy mother the red spots on s face deepened the words bring my childhood back again and malluch they prove you genuine jew i believe i can trust let go the arm he was holding and caught the folds of the gown covering his own breast and pressed them close if to smother pain or feeling there sharp pain my father he said bore good name and was not without honor in jerusalem where he dwelt my mother at his death was in the prime of womanhood and it is not enough to say of her she was good and beautiful in her tongue was the law of kindness and her works were the praise of all in the gates and she smiled at days to come i had little sister and she and i were the family and we were so happy that i at least have never seen harm in the saying of the old rabbi god could not be everywhere and therefore he made one day an accident happened to roman in authority he was riding past our house at the head of cohort the legionaries burst the gate and rushed in and seized us i project gutenberg https seen my mother or sister since i can not say they are dead or living i not know what became of them but malluch the man in the chariot yonder was present at the separation he gave us over to the captors he heard my mother s prayer her children and he laughed when they dragged her away hardly may one say which graves deepest in memory love or hate i knew him he caught the listener s arm again and malluch he knows and takes with him now the secret i would give my life he could tell if she lives and where she is and her condition if sorrow has made the two they are dead he could tell where they died and of what and where their bones await my and will he not why i am jew and he is but romans have tongues and jews though ever so despised have methods to beguile such he and besides the secret is one of state all my father s property was conﬁscated and malluch nodded his head slowly much to admit the argument then he asked anew did he not recognize you he could not i was sent to death in life and have been long since accounted of the i wonder you did not strike him said malluch yielding to touch of passion that would have been to put him past serving forever i would have had to kill him and death you know keeps secrets better even than guilty the man who with so much to avenge could so calmly put such an opportunity aside must be conﬁdent of his future or have ready some better design and malluch s interest changed with the thought it ceased to be that of an emissary in duty bound to another was actually asserting claim upon him his own sake in other words malluch was preparing to serve him with good heart and from downright admiration after brief pause resumed speaking i would not take his life good malluch against that extreme the possession of the secret is the present at least his safeguard yet i may punish him and so you give help i will he is roman said malluch without hesitation and i am of the tribe of judah i will help you if you choose put under the most solemn give your hand that will their hands fell apart said with lightened feeling that i would charge you with is not difﬁcult good friend neither is it dreadful to conscience let us move they took the road which led to the right across the meadow spoken of in the description of the coming to the fountain hur was ﬁrst to break the silence you know sheik ilderim the generous project gutenberg https where is his orchard of palms or rather malluch how far is it beyond the village of daphne malluch was touched by doubt he recalled the prettiness of the favor shown him by the woman at the fountain and wondered if he who had the sorrows of mother in mind was about to forget them lure of love yet he replied the orchard of palms lies beyond the village two hours by horse and one by swift thank you and to your knowledge once more have the games of which you told been widely published and when will they take place the questions were suggestive and if they did not restore malluch his conﬁdence they at least stimulated his curiosity oh yes they will be of ample splendor the prefect is rich and could afford to lose his place yet is the way with successful men his love of riches is nowise diminished and to gain friend at court if nothing more he must make ado the consul maxentius who is coming hither to make ﬁnal preparations campaign against the parthians the money there is in the preparations the citizens of antioch know from experience so they have had permission to join the prefect in the honors intended the great man month ago heralds went to the four quarters to proclaim the opening of the circus the celebration the name of the prefect would be of itself good guarantee of variety and magniﬁcence particularly throughout the east but when to his promises antioch joins hers all the islands and the cities by the sea stand assured of the extraordinary and will be here in person or by their most famous professionals the fees of fered are and the have heard it is second only to the at rome you mean well ours seats two hundred thousand people yours seats thousand more yours is of marble so is ours in arrangement they are exactly the are the rules the same malluch smiled if antioch dared be original son of arrius rome would not be the mistress she is the laws of the circus maximus govern except in one particular there but four chariots may start at once here all start without reference to number that is the practise of the greeks said yes antioch is more greek than so then malluch i may choose my own chariot your own chariot and horses there is restriction upon either while replying malluch observed the thoughtful look on hur s face give place to one of satisfaction one thing more now malluch when will the celebration be ah your pardon the other answered the next day he said counting aloud then to speak in the roman style if the be propitious the consul arrives yes the sixth day from this we have the the time is short malluch but it is the last words were spoken decisively by the prophets of our old israel i project gutenberg https to the reins again stay conditi on is there assurance that messala will be competitor malluch saw now the plan and all its opportunities the humiliation of the roman and he had not been true descendant of jacob if with all his interest wakened he had not rushed to consideration of the chances his voice actually trembled he said have you the practise fear not my friend the winners in the circus maximus have held their crowns these three years at my will ask the best of they will tell you so in the last great games the emperor himself offered his patro nage if i would take his horses in hand and run them against the entries of the but you did not malluch spoke eagerly am jew seemed shrinking within himself he and though i wear roman name i dared not professionally thing to sully my father s name in the cloisters and courts of the temple in the palaestrae i could indulge practise which if followed into the circus would become an abomination and if i take to the course here malluch i swear it will not be the prize or the winner s not so cried malluch the fee is ten thousand fortune life not though the prefect trebled it ﬁfty times better than that better than all the imperial revenues from the ﬁrst year of the ﬁrst will make this race to humble my enemy vengeance is permitted by the law malluch smiled and nodded if saying right jew to understand jew the messala will drive he said directly he is committed to the race in many publication in the streets and in the baths and theaters the palace and barracks and to ﬁx him past retreat his name is on the tablets of every young spendthrift in in wager malluch yes in wager and every day he comes ostentatiously to practise you saw ah and that is the chariot and those the horses with which he will make the race thank you thank you malluch you have served well already i am satisﬁed now be my guide to the orchard of palms and give introduction to sheik ilderim the when his horses may be engaged you like them then answered with animation i saw them from the stand an instant only messala then drove up and i might not look at anything else yet i recognized them of the blood which is the wonder well the glory of the deserts i never saw the kind befor except in the stables of cæsar but once seen they are always to be known upon meeting i will know you malluch though you not so much salute i will know you by your face by your form by your manner and by the same signs i will know them and with project gutenberg https certainty if all that is said of them be true and i can bring their spirit under control of mine i win the sestertii said malluch laughing answered quickly i will what better becomes man born to the heritage of will humble mine enemy in most public place but he added impatiently we are losing time how can we most quickly reach the tents of the sheik malluch took moment reﬂection it is best we go straight to the village which is fortunately near by if two swift camels are to be had hire there we will be on the road but an hour let us about it the village was an assemblage of palaces in beautiful gardens interspersed with khans of princely sort dromedaries were happily secured and upon them the journey to the famous orchard of palms was project gutenberg https x beyond the village the country was undulating and cultivated in fact it was the of antioch with not foot lost to labor the steep faces of the hills were terraced even the hedges were brighter of the trailing vines which besides the lure of shade offered sweet promises of wine to come and grapes in clustered purple ripeness over and through apricot and groves and groves of oranges and limes the washed houses of the farmers were seen and everywhere plenty the smiling daughter of peace gave notice by her thousand signs that she was at home making the generous traveller merry at heart until he was even disposed to give rome her dues occasionally also views were had of taurus and lebanon between which separating line of silver the orontes placidly pursued its way in course of their journey the friends came to the river which they followed with the windings of the road now over bold bluffs and then into vales all alike allotted and if the land was in full foliage of oak and sycamore and myrtle and bay and arbutus and perfuming jasmine the river was bright with slanted sunlight which would have slept where it fell but ships in endless procession gliding with the current tacking the wind or bounding under the impulse of coming some going and all suggestive of the sea and distant peoples and famous places and things coveted on account of their rarity to the fancy there is nothing so winsome white sail seaward blown unless it be white sail homeward boun d its voyage happily done and down the shore the friends went continuously till they came to lake fed by from the river clear deep and without current an old dominated the angle of the inlet turning to the left at the foot of the tree malluch clapped his hands and shouted look look the orchard of palms the scene was nowhere else to be found unless in the favored oases of arabia or the ptolemaean farms along the nile and to sustain sensation new it was delight ful was admitted into tract of land apparently without limit and level ﬂoor all under foot was fresh grass in syria the rarest and most beautiful production of the soil if he looked up it was to see the sky paley blue through the groinery of countless very patriarchs of their kind so numerous and old and of such mighty girth so tall so serried so wide of branch each branch so perfect with fronds plumy and waxlike and brilliant they seemed enchanters enchanted here was the grass coloring the very atmosphere there the lake cool and clear rippling but few feet under the surface and helping the trees to their long life in old age did the grove of daphne excel this one and the palms if they knew s thought and would win him after way of their own seemed he passed under their arches to stir and sprinkle him with dewy coolness the road wound in close parallelism with the shore of the lake and when it carried the travellers down to the water s edge project gutenberg https always on that side shining expan limited not far off by the opposite shore on which on this one tree but the palm was permitted see that said malluch pointing to giant of the place each ring upon its trunk marks year of its life count them from root to branch and if the sheik tells you the grove was planted before the seleucidæ were heard of in antioch not doubt one may not look at perfect but that with subtlety all its own it assumes presence itself and makes poet of the beholder this is the explanation of the honors it has received beginning with the artists of the ﬁrst kings who could ﬁnd form in all the earth to serve them so well model the pillars of their palaces and temples and the same reason was moved to say i saw him at the stand good malluch sheik ilderim appeared to be very common man the rabbis in jerusalem would look down upon him i fear son of dog of edom how came he in possession of the orchard and how has he been able to hold it against the greed of roman governors if blood derives excellence from time son of arrius then is old ilderim man though he be an uncircumcised malluch spoke warmly all his fathers before him were sheiks one of shall not say when he lived or did the good helped king who was being hunted with swords the story says he loaned him thousand horsemen who knew the paths of the wilderness and its shepherds know the scant hills they inhabit with their ﬂocks and they carried him here and there until the opportunity came and then with their spears they slew the enemy and set him upon his throne again and the king it is said remembered the service and brought the son of the desert to this place and bade him set up his tent and bring his family and his herds the lake and trees and all the land from the river to the nearest mountains were his and his children s forever and they have never been disturbed in the possession the rulers succeeding have found it policy to keep good terms with the tribe to whom the lord has given increase of men and horses and camels and riches making them masters of many highways between cities so that it is with them any time they please to say to commerce go in peace or stop and what they say shall be done even the prefect in the citadel overlooking antioch thinks it happy day with him when ilderim surnamed the generous on account of good deeds done unto all manner of men with his wives and children and his trains of camels and horses and his belongings of sheik moving our fathers abraham and jacob moved comes up to exchange brieﬂy his bitter wells the pleasantness you see about how is it then said who had been listening unmindful of the slow gait of the drom edaries i saw the sheik tear his beard while he cursed himself that he had put trust in roman cæsar had he heard him might have said i like not such friend this put him away it would be but shrewd judgment malluch replied smiling ilderim is not lover of rome he has grievance three years ago the parthians rode across the road from bozra to damascus and fell upon caravan laden among other things with project gutenberg https of district over that way they slew every creature taken which the censors in rome could have forgiven if the imperial treasure had been spared and forwarded the farmers of the taxes being chargeable with the loss complained to cæsar and cæsar held herod to payment and herod on his part seized property of ilderim whom he charged with treasonable neglect of duty the sheik appealed to cæsar and cæsar has made him such answer might be looked from the unwinking sphinx the old man s heart has been aching sore ever since and he nurses his wrath and takes pleasure in its daily he can nothing well said malluch that involves another explanation which i will give you if we can draw nearer but see hospitality of the sheik begins children are speaking to the dromedaries stopped and looked down upon some little girls of the syrian peasant class who were offering him their baskets ﬁlled with dates the fruit was freshly gathered and not to be refused he stooped and took it and he did so man in the tree by which they were halted cried peace to you and welcome their thanks said to the children the friends moved on at such gait the animals chose you must know malluch continued pausing now and then to dispose of date that the merchant simonides gives his conﬁdence and sometimes ﬂatters by taking into council and i attend him at his house i have made acquaintance with many of his friends who knowing my footing with the host talk to him freely in my presence in that way i became somewhat intimate with sheik moment s attention wandered before his mind s eye there arose the image pure gentle and appealing of esther the merchant s daughter her dark eyes bright with the peculiar jewish lustre met his in modest gaze he heard her step when she approached him with the wine and her voice she tendered him the cup and he acknowledged to himself again all the sympathy she manifested him and manifested so plainly that words were unnecessary and so sweetly that words would have been but detraction the vision was exceeding pleasant but upon his turning to malluch it ﬂew away few weeks ago said malluch continuing the old arab called on simonides and found present i observed he seemed much moved about something and in deference offered to withdraw but he himself forbade you are an israelite he said stay i have strange story to the emphasis on the word israelite excited my curiosity i remained and this is in substance his cut it short because we are drawing nigh the tent and i leave the details to the good man himself good many years ago three men called at ilderim s tent out in the wilderness they were all foreigners hindoo greek and an egyptian and they had come on camels the largest he had ever seen and all white he welcomed them and gave them rest next morning they arose and prayed prayer new to the prayer addressed to god and his with much mystery besides after breaking fast with him the egyptian told who they were and whence they had come each had seen star out of which voice had bidden them go to jerusalem and ask where is he that is born king of project gutenberg https they obeyed from jerusalem they were led by star to bethlehem where in cave they found child newly born which they fell down and worshipped and after worshipping it and giving it costly presents and bearing witness of what it was they took to their camels and ﬂed without pause to the sheik because if him surnamed the lay hands upon them he would certainly kill them and faithful to his habit the sheik took care of them and kept them concealed year when they departed leaving with him gifts of great value and each going separate way it is indeed most wonderful story exclaimed at its conclusion what did you say they were to ask at jerusalem they were to ask where is he that is born king of the jews was that all there was more to the question but i can not recall and they found the child yes and worshipped it is miracle ilderim is grave man though excitable all arabs are lie on his tongue is malluch spoke positively thereupon the dromedaries were forgotten and quite unmindful of their riders they turned off the road to the growing grass has ilderim heard nothing more of the three men asked hur what became of them ah yes that was the cause of his coming to simonides the day of which i was speaking only the night before that day the egyptian reappeared to where here at the door of the tent to which we are how knew he the man you knew the horses face and manner by nothing else he rode the same great white camel and gave him the same the it is wonder of the lord s spoke with excitement and malluch wondering asked why so balthasar you said yes balthasar the that was the name the old man gave us at the fountain today then at the reminder malluch became excited it is true he said and the camel was the you saved the man s and the woman said like one speaking to himself the woman was his daughter he fell to thinking and even the reader will say he was having vision of the woman and that it was more welcome than that of esther if only because it stayed longer with him but tell again he said presently were the three to ask where is he that is to be king of the jews project gutenberg https not exactly the words were born to be king of the jews those were the words the old sheik caught them ﬁrst in the desert and he has ever since been waiting the coming of the king nor can any one shake his faith that he will king yes and bringing the doom of says the kept silent awhile thinking and trying to control his feelings the old man is one of many millions he said one of many millions each with wrong to avenge and this strange faith malluch is bread and wine to his hope who but herod may be king of the jews while rome endures but following the story did you hear what simonides said to him if ilderim is grave man simonides is wise one malluch replied i listened and he but hark some one comes overtaking the noise grew louder until presently they heard the rumble of wheels mixed with the beating of moment later sheik ilderim himself appeared on horseback followed by train among which were the four arabs drawing the chariot the sheik s chin in its mufﬂing of long white beard was drooped upon his breast our friends had him but at sight of them he raised his head and spoke kindly peace to you my friend malluch welcome and tell you are not going but just come that you have something from the good the lord of his fathers keep him in life many years to come ay take up the straps both of you and follow i have bread and leben or if you prefer it arrack and the ﬂesh of young kid come they followed after him to the door of the tent in which when they were dismounted he stood to receive them holding platter with three cups ﬁlled with creamy liquor just drawn from great skin bottle pendent from the central post drink he said heartily drink this is the of the they each took cup and drank till but the foam remained enter now in god s and when they were gone in malluch took the sheik aside and spoke to him privately after which he went to and excused himself i have told the sheik about you and he will give you the trial of his horses in the morning he is your friend having done you all i can you must the rest and let return to antioch there is one there who has my promise to meet him i have choice but to go i will come back prepared if all goes well in the meantime to stay with you until the games are over with blessings given and received malluch set out in project gutenberg https xi what time the lower horn of new moon touched the castellated piles on mount sulpius and two thirds of the people of antioch were out on their comforting themselves with the night breeze when it blew and with fans when it failed simonides sat in the chair which had come to be part of him and from the terrace looked down over the river and his ships at their moorings the wall at his back cast its shadow broadly over the water to the opposite shore above him the endless tramp upon the bridge went on esther was holding plate him containing his frugal wheaten cakes light wafers some honey and bowl of milk into which he now and then dipped the wafers after dipping them into the honey malluch is laggard he said showing where his thoughts were you believe he will come esther asked unless he has taken to the sea or the desert and is yet following on he will simonides spoke with quiet conﬁdence he may write she said not so esther he would have despatched letter when he found he could not return and told so because i have not received such letter i know he can come and i hope so she said very softly something in the utterance attracted his attention it might have been the tone it might have been the wish the smallest bird can not light upon the greatest tree without sending shock to its most distant ﬁbre every mind is at times less sensitive to the most triﬂing words you wish him to come esther he asked yes she said lifting her eyes to his why can you tell he persisted because hesitated then began because the young man the stop was full our master is that the word and you still think i should not suffer him to go away without telling him to come if he chooses and take all we all goods the shekels the ships the slaves and the mighty credit which is mantle of cloth of gold and ﬁnest silver spun by the greatest of the angels of she made answer does that move you nothing he said with the slightest taint of bitterness well well i have found esther the worst reality is never unendurable when it comes out from behind the clouds through which we at ﬁrst see it even the rack i suppose it will be so with death and by that philosophy the slavery to which we are going must afterwhile become project gutenberg https pleases even now to think what favored man our master is the fortune cost him an anxiety not drop of sweat not so much thought it attaches to him undreamed of and in his youth and esther let waste little vanity with the reﬂection he gets what he could not go into the market and buy with all the pelf in my child my darling thou blossom from the tomb of my lost rachel he drew her to him and kissed her herself once her mother say not so she said when his hand fell from her neck let us think better of him he knows what sorrow is and will set us ah thy instincts are ﬁne esther and thou knowest i lean upon them in doubtful cases where good or bad is to be pronounced of person standing before thee he stood this morning his voice rose and these limbs upon which i can not body drawn and beaten out of human are not all i bring him of myself oh i bring him soul which has triumphed over torture and roma n malice keener than any bring him mind which has eyes to see gold at distance farther than the ships of solomon sailed and power to bring it to esther into my palm here the ﬁngers to grip and keep lest it take wings at some other s mind skilled at scheming stopped and why esther before the new moon which in the courts of the temple on the holy hill they are this moment celebrating passes into its next quartering i could ring the world so to startle even cæsar know you child i have that faculty which is better than any one sense better than perfect body better than courage and will better than experience ordinarily the best product of the longest faculty divinest of men but which stopped and laughed again not bitterly but with real but which even the great not sufﬁciently account while with the herd it is faculty of drawing men to my purpose and holding them faithfully to its achievement by which against things to be done i multiply myself into hundreds and thousands so the captains of my ships plough the seas and bring honest returns so malluch follows the youth our master and will then footstep was heard upon the ha esther said i not so he is we will have tidings thy sake sweet my lily just pray the lord god who has not forgotten his wandering sheep of israel that they be good and comforting now we will know if he will let thee go with all thy beauty and with all my malluch came to the chair peace to you good master he said with low obeisance and to you esther most excellent of he stood before them deferentially and the attitude and the address left it difﬁcult to deﬁne his relation to them the one was that of servant the other indicated the familiar and friend on the other side simonides was his habit in business after answering the salutation went straight to the subject what of the young man malluch the events of the day were told quietly and in the simplest words and until he was through there was interruption nor did the listener in the chair so much move hand during project gutenberg https but his eyes wide open and bright and an occasional breath he might have been accounted an efﬁgy thank you thank you malluch he said heartily at the conclusion you have done one could have done better now what say you of the young man s nationality he is an israelite good master and of the tribe of you are positive very he appears to have told you but little of his he has somewhere learned to be prudent i might call him distrustful he bafﬂed all my attempts upon his conﬁdence until we started from the castalian fount going to the village of place of abomination why went he there i would say from curiosity the ﬁrst motive of the many who go but very strangely he took intere st in the things he saw of the temple he merely asked if it were grecian good master the young man has trouble of mind from which he would hide and he went to the grove i think we go to sepulchres with our dead went to bury that were well if so simonides said in low voice then louder malluch the curse of the time is prodigality the poor make themselves poorer apes of the rich and the merely rich carry themselves like princes saw you signs of the weakness in the youth did he display of rome or israel none none good master surely malluch where there are so many inducements to folly much i mean to eat and he made you generous offer of some sort his age if nothing more would warrant that he neither ate nor drank in my company in what he said or did malluch could you in anywise detect his master you know they peep through cracks close enough to stop the give to understand you said malluch in doubt well you know we nor speak nor act much less decide grave questions concerning ourselves except we be driven by motive in that respect what made you of him to that master simonides i can answer with much assurance he is devoted to ﬁnding his mother and ﬁrst then he has grievance against rome and the messala of whom i told you had something to with the wrong the great present object is to humiliate him the meeting at the fountain furnished an opportunity but it was put aside not sufﬁciently the messala is inﬂuential said simonides thoughtfully yes but the next meeting will be in the then the son of arrius will how know you malluch smiled i am judging by what he is that all project gutenberg https there is much better ay but malluch his idea of is its scope does he limit it to the few who did him the wrong or does he take in the many and his feeling but the vagary of sensitive boy or has it the seasoning of suffering manhood to give it endurance you know malluch the vengeful thought that has root merely in the mind is but dream of idlest sort which one clear day will dissipate while revenge the passion is disease of the heart which climbs up up to the brain and feeds itself on both in this question simonides the ﬁrst time showed signs of feeling he spoke with rapid utterance and with clenched hands and the eagerness of man illustrating the disease he described good my master malluch replied one of my reasons believing the young man jew is the intensity of his hate it was plain to he had himself under watch was natural seeing how long he has lived in an atmosphere of roman jealousy yet i saw it when he wanted to know ilderim s feeling towards rome and again when i told him the story of the sheik and the wise man and spoke of the question where is he that is born king of the jews simonides leaned forward quickly ah malluch his his words let judge the impression the mystery made upon he wanted to know the exact words were they to be or born to be it appeared he was struck by seeming difference in the ef fect of the two simonides settled back into his pose of listening judge then said malluch i told him ilderim s view of the mystery the king would come with the doom of rome the young man s blood rose over his cheeks and forehead and he said earnestly who but herod can be king while rome endures meaning what that the empire must be destroyed before there could be another simonides gazed time at the ships and their shadows slowly swinging together in the river when he looked up it was to end the interview enough malluch he said get you to eat and make ready to return to the orchard of palms you must help the young man in his coming trial come to in the morning i will send letter to then in an undertone if to himself he added i may attend the circus when malluch after the customary benediction given and received was gone simonides took deep draught of milk and seemed refreshed and easy of mind put the meal down esther he said it is over she obeyed here now she resumed her place upon the arm of the chair close to him god is good to very good he said fervently his habit is to move in mystery yet sometimes he permits us to think we see and understand him i am old dear and must go but now in this eleventh hour when my hope was beginning to die he sends project gutenberg https one with promise and i am lifted up i see the way to great part in circumstance itself so great that it shall be new birth to the whole world and i see reason the gift of my great riches and the end which they were designed verily my child i take hold on life anew esther nestled closer to him if to bring his thoughts from their far the king has been born he continued imagining he was still speaking to her and he must be near the half of common life balthasar says he was child on his mother s lap when he saw him and gave him presents and worship and ilderim holds it was years ago last december when balthasar and his companions came to his tent asking from herod wherefore the coming can not now be long delayed morrow it may be holy fathers of israel what happiness in the thought i seem to hear the crash of the falling of old walls and the clamor of universal and the uttermost joy of men the earth opens to take rome in and they look up and laugh and sing that she is not while we are then he laughed at himself why esther heard you ever the like surely i have on the passion of singer the heat of blood and the thrill of miriam and david in my thoughts which should be those of plain worker in ﬁgures and facts there is confusion of cymbals clashing and loud beaten and the voices of multitude standing around throne i will put the thinking by the present only dear when the king comes he will need money and men he was child born of woman he will be but man after all bound to human ways you and i are and the money he will have need of getters and keepers and the men leaders there there see you not broad road my walking and the running of the youth our master at the end of it glory and revenge us both paused struck with the selﬁshness of scheme in whic h she had part or good result then added kissing her and happiness thy mother s she sat still saying nothing then he remembered the difference in natures and the law by which we are not permitted always to take delight in the same cause or be equally afraid of the same thing he remembered she was but girl of what are you thinking esther he said in his common way if the thought have the form of wish give it little one while the power remains mine power you know is fretful thing and hath its wings always spread she answered with simplicity almost childish send him father send him and not let him go into the ah he said prolonging the exclama tion and again his eyes fell upon the river where the shadows were more shadowy than ever since the moon had sunk far down behind sulpius leaving the city to the ineffectual stars shall we say it reader he was touched by twinge of jealousy if she should really love the young master oh that could not be she was too young but the idea had fast grip and directly held him still and cold she was sixteen he knew it well on the last natal day he had gone with her to the shipyard where there was launch and the yellow ﬂag which the galley bore to its bridal with the waves had on project gutenberg https esther so they celebrated the day together yet the fact struck him now with the force of surprise there are realizations which come to us all painfully mostly however such pertain to ourselves that we are growing old instance and more terrible that we must die such one crept into his heart shadowy the shadows yet substantial enough to wring from him sigh which was almost groan it was not sufﬁcient that she should enter upon her young womanhood servant but she must carry to her master her affections the truth and tenderness and delicacy of which he the father so well knew because to this time they had all been his own undividedly the ﬁend whose task it is to torture us with fears and bitter thoughts seldom does his work by halves in the pang of the moment the brave old man lost sight of his new scheme and of the miraculous king its subject by mighty effort however he controlled himself and asked calmly not go into the circus esther why child it is not place son of israel father rabbinical rabbinical esther is that all the tone of the inquiry was searching and went to her heart which began to beat loudly she could not answer confusion new and strangely pleasant fell upon her the young man is to have the fortun he said taking her hand and speaking more tenderly he is to have the ships and the esther all yet i did not feel poor thou wert left and thy love so like the dead rachel tell is he to have that too she bent over him and laid her cheek against his head speak esther i will be the stronger of the knowledge in warning there is she sat up then and spoke if she were truth s holy self comfort thee father i will never leave thee though he take my love i will be thy handmaid ever now and stooping she kissed him and more she said continuing he is comely in my sight and the pleading of his voice drew to him and i shudder to think of him in danger yes father i would be more than glad to see him again still the love that is unrequited can not be perfect love wherefore i will wait time remembering i am thy daughter and my mother very blessing of the lord art thou esther blessing to keep rich though all else be lost and by his holy name and everlasting life i swear thou shalt not suf at his request little later the servant came and rolled the chair into the room where he sat time thinking of the coming of the king while she went of f and slept the sleep of the project gutenberg https xii the palace across the river nearly opposite simonides place is said to have been completed by the famous epiphanes and was all such habitation can be imagined though he was builder whose taste ran to the immense rather than the classical now so an architectural imitator in other words of the persians instead of the greeks the wall enclosing the whole island to the waters edge and built the double purpose of bulwark against the river and defence against the mob was said to have rendered the palace unﬁt constant occupancy insomuch that the legates abandoned it and moved to another residence erected them on the western ridge of mount sulpius under the temple of jupiter persons were not wanting however who ﬂatly denied the bill against the ancient abode they said with shrewdness at least that the real object of the removal of the legates was not more healthful locality but the assurance afforded them by the huge barracks named according to the prevalent style citadel situated just over the way on the eastern ridge of the mount and the opinion had plausible showing among other pertinent things it was remarked that the palace was kept in perpetual readiness use and when consul general of the army king or visiting potentate of any kind arrived at antioch quarters were at once assigned him on the island we have to with but one apartment in the old pile the residue of it is left to the reader s fancy and pleases him he may go through its gardens baths halls and labyrinth of rooms to the pavilions on the roof all furnished became house of fame in city which was more nearly milton s gorgeous east than any other in the world at this age the apartment alluded to would be termed saloon it was quite spacious ﬂoored with polished marble slabs and lighted in the day by skylights in which colored mica served glass the walls were broken by atlantes two of which were alike but all supporting cornice wrought with arabesques exceedingly intricate in form and more elegant on account of superadditions of green tyrian purple and gold around the room ran continuous divan of indian silks and wool of cashmere the furniture consisted of tables and stools of egyptian patterns grotesquely carved we have left simonides in his chair perfecting his scheme in aid of the miraculous king whose coming he has decided is so close at hand esther is asleep and now having crossed the river by the bridge and made way through the guarded gate and number of babylonian halls and courts let us enter the gilded saloon there are ﬁve chandeliers hanging by sliding bronze chains from the in each corner and in the centre enormous pyramids of lighted lamps illuminating even the demoniac faces of the atlantes and the complex tracery of the cornice about the tables seated or standing or moving restlessly from one to another there are probably hundred persons whom we must study at least project gutenberg https are all young some of them little more than boys that they are italians and mostly romans is past doubt they all speak latin in purity while each one appears in the dress of the great capital on the tiber that is in tunics short of sleeve and skirt style of vesture well adapted to the climate of antioch and especially comfortable in the too close atmosphere of the saloon on the divan here and there togas and lacernae lie where they have been carelessly tossed some of them signiﬁcantly bordered with purple on the divan also lie sleepers stretched at ease whether they were overcome by the heat and fatigue of the sultry day or by bacchus we will not pause to inquire the hum of voices is loud and incessan sometimes there is an explosion of laughter sometimes burst of rage or exultation but over all prevails sharp prolonged rattle at ﬁrst somewhat confusing to the if we approach the tables however the mystery solves itself the company is at the favorite games draughts and dice singly or together and the rattle is merely of the tesserae or ivory cubes loudly shaken and the moving of the hostes on the checkered boards who are the company good flavius said player holding his piece in suspended movement thou seest yon lacerna that one in front of us on the divan it is fresh from the shop and hath shoulder of gold broad well said flavius intent upon his game i have seen such before wherefore thine may not be old yet by the girdle of venus it is not new what of it nothing only i would give it to ﬁnd man who knows ha ha something cheaper i will ﬁnd thee here several with purple who will take thy of fer but play so by all the jupiters now what sayest thou again be it and the wager then each drew his tablets and stilus and made memorandum and while they were resetting the pieces flavius returned to his friend s remark man who knows everything hercle the oracles would die what wouldst thou with such monster answer to one question my flavius then perpol i would cut his and the question i would have him tell the hour said i the will arrive good play good play i have you and why the minute hast thou ever stood uncovered in the syrian sun on the quay at which he will land the ﬁres of the vesta are not so hot and by the stator of our father romulus i would die if die i must in rome avernus is here there in the square before the forum i could stand and with my hand raised thus touch the ﬂoor of the gods ha by venus my flavius thou didst beguile i have lost fortune project gutenberg https again i must have back my be it and they played again and again and when day stealing through the skylights began to dim the lamps it found the two in the same places at the same table still at the game like most of the company they were military attaches of the consul awaiting his arrival and amusing themselves meantime during this conversation party entered the room and unnoticed at ﬁrst proceeded to the central table the signs were that they had come from revel just dismissed some of them kept their feet with difﬁculty around the leader s brow was chaplet which marked him master of the feast if not the giver the wine had made impression upon him unless to heighten his beauty which was of the most manly roman style he carried his head high raised the blood ﬂushed his lips and cheeks brightly his eyes glittered though the manner in which shrouded in toga spotless white and of ample folds he walked was too nearly imperial one sober and not cæsar in going to the table he made room himself and his followers with little ceremony and apologies and when at length he stopped and looked over it and at the players they all turned to him with shout like cheer messala messala they cried those in distant quarters hearing the cry it where they were instantly there were dissolution of groups and of games and general rush towards the centre messala took the demonstration indifferently and proceeded presently to show the ground of his popularity health to thee drusus my friend he said to the player next at his right thy tablets he raised the waxen boards glanced at the memoranda of wagers and tossed them down denarii only of cartmen and butchers he said with scornful laugh by the drunken semele to what is rome coming when cæsar sits nights waiting turn of fortune to bring him but beggarly denarius the scion of the drusi reddened to his brows but the bystanders broke in upon his reply by surging closer around the table and shouting the messala the messala men of the tiber messala continued wresting box with the dice in it from hand who is he most favored of the gods roman who is he lawgiver of the nations roman who is he by sword right the universal master the company were of the easily inspired and the thought was one to which they were born in twinkling they snatched the answer from him roman roman they shouted lingered to catch their yet there is better than the best of he tossed his patrician head and paused if to sting them with his sneer hear ye he asked there is better than the best of cried one bacchus yelled project gutenberg https thundered the crowd messala answered among name him name him they demanded i will he said the next lull he who to the perfection of rome hath added the perfection of the east who to the arm of conquest which is western hath also the art needful to the enjoyment of dominion which is perpol his best is roman after all some one shouted and there was great laugh and long clappin g of admission that messala had the advantage in the east he continued we have gods only wine women and fortune and the greatest of them is fortune wherefore our motto who dareth what i dare the senate ﬁt battle ﬁttest him who seeking the best challenges the his voice dropped into an easy familiar tone but without relaxing the ascendancy he had gained in the great chest up in the citadel i have ﬁve talents coin current in the markets and here are the receipts from his tunic he drew roll of paper and ﬂinging it on the table continued amidst breathless silence every eye having him in view ﬁxed on his every ear listening the sum lies there the measure of what i dare who of you dares so much you are silent is it too great i will strike off one talent what still silent come then throw once these three three two at the honor of the river by which you were east against rome west the barbarous against tiber the sacred he rattled the dice overhead while waiting the orontes against the tiber he repeated with an increase of scornful emphasis not man moved then he ﬂung the box upon the table and laughing took up the receipts ha ha ha by the olympian jove i know now ye have fortunes to make or to mend therefore are ye come to antioch ho cecilius here messala cried man behind him here am i perishing in the mob and begging drachma to settle with the ragged ferryman but pluto take these new ones have not so much an obolus among the sally provoked burst of laughter under which the saloon rang and rang again messala alone kept his gravity go thou he said to cecilius to the chamber whence we came and bid the servants bring the amphorae here and the cups and goblets if these our countrymen looking fortune have not purses by the syrian bacchus i will see if they are not better blessed with stomachs haste thee then he turned to drusus with laugh heard throughout the apartment ha ha my friend be thou not offended because i levelled the cæsar in thee down to the denarii thou seest i did but use the name to try these ﬁne ﬂedglings of our old rome come my drusus come he took up the box again and rattled the dice merrily here what sum thou wilt let us measure project gutenberg https manner was frank cordial winsome drusus melted in moment by the nymphae yes he said laughing i will throw with thee very boyish person was looking over the table watching the scene suddenly messala turned to him who art thou he asked the lad drew back nay by castor and his brother too i meant not offence it is rule among men in matters other than dice to keep the record closest when the deal is least i have need of clerk wilt thou serve the young fellow drew his tablets ready to keep the score the manner was irresistible hold messala hold cried drusus i know not if it be ominous to stay the poised dice with question but one occurs to and i must ask it though venus slap with her nay my drusus venus with her girdle off is venus in love to thy will make the throw and hold it against mischance he turned the box upon the table and held it ﬁrmly over the dice and drusus asked did you ever see one quintus arrius the duumvir son i knew not he had well it is nothing drusus added indifferently only my messala pollux was not more like castor than arrius is like the remark had the ef fect of signal twenty voices took it up true true his face they cried what answered one disgusted messala is roman arrius is jew thou sayest right third exclaimed he is jew or momus lent his mother the wrong there was promise of dispute seeing which messala interposed the wine is not come my drusus and thou seest i have the freckled pythias they were dogs in leash to arrius i will accept thy opinion of him so thou tell more about well be he jew or by the great god pan i say it not in disrespect of thy feelings my messala arrius is handsome and brave and shrewd the emperor offered him favor and patronage which he refused he came up through mystery and keepeth distance if he felt himself better or knew himself worse than the rest of us in the palaestrae he was unmatched he played with the giants from the rhine and the hornless bulls of sarmatia they were willow wisps the duumvir left him vastly rich he has passion arms and thinks of nothing but war maxentius admitted him into his family and he was to have taken ship with us but we lost him at ravenna nevertheless he arrived safely we heard of him this morning perpol instead of coming to the palace or going to the citadel he dropped his baggage at the khan and hath disappeared at the beginning of the speech messala listened with polite indifference it proceeded he became more attentive at project gutenberg https he took his hand from the and called out ho my caius dost thou hear youth at his myrtilus or comrade in the day s chariot much pleas ed with the attention did i not my messala i were not thy dost thou remember the man who gave thee the fall by the of bacchus have i not bruised shoulder to help keep it in mind and he seconded the words with shrug that submer ged his ears well be thou grateful to the have found thy enemy thereupon messala turned to drusus tell us more of him who is both jew and phoebus combination to make centaur lovely what garments doth he af fect my drusus those of the hearest thou caius said messala the fellow is one he hath the visage of he loveth best the garb of and in the palaestrae fame and fortune come of

way by all the decent gods i would not strain thy courtesy to the point of breaking but now help thou see put his hand on the again see how close i hold the pythias and their secret thou didst speak i think of mystery in connection with the coming of the son of arrius tell of tis nothing messala nothing drusus replied child s story when arrius the father sailed in pursuit of the pirates he was without wife or family he returned with of whom we next day adopted adopted him messala repeated by the gods drusus thou dost indeed interest where did the duumvir ﬁnd the boy and who was he who shall answer thee that messala who but the young arrius himself perpol in the ﬁght the but his galley returning vessel found him and one of the crew who upon the same plank i give you now the story of the rescuers which hath this excellence at hath never been contradicted they say the duumvir s companion on the plank was jew echoed project gutenberg https and how drusus slave when the two were lifted to the deck the duumvir was in his tribune s armor and the other in the vesture of rower messala rose from leaning against the table galley checked the debasing word and looked around once in his life at loss just then procession of slaves ﬁled into the room some with great jars of wine others with baskets of fruits and confections others again with cups and ﬂagons mostly silver there was inspiration in the sight instantly messala climbed upon stool men of the tiber he said in clear voice let us turn this waiting our chief into feast of bacchus whom choose ye master drusus arose who shall be master but the giver of the feast he said answer they gave their reply in shout messala took the chaplet from his head gave it to drusus who climbed upon the table and in the view of all solemnly replaced it making messala master of the night there came with into the room he said some friends just risen from table that our feast may have the approval of sacred custom bring hither that one of them most overcome by din of voices answered here he is here he is and from the ﬂoor where he had fallen youth was brought forward so effeminately beautiful he might have passed the the crown would have dropped from his head and the thyrsus from his hand lift him upon the table the master said it was found he could not sit help him drusus the fair nyone may yet help drusus took the inebriate in his arms then addressing the limp ﬁgure messala said amidst profound silence bacchus greatest of the gods be thou propitious night and myself and these thy votaries i vow this chaplet and from his head he raised it reverent i vow this chaplet to thy altar in the grove of he bowed replaced the crown upon his locks then stooped and uncovered the dice saying with laugh see my drusus by

importance to go about with small establishment he had reputation to keep with his tribe such became prince and patriarch of the greatest following in all the desert east of syria with the people of the cities he had another reputation which was that of one of the richest personages not king in all the east and being rich in fact money well in servants came ls horses and ﬂocks of all took pleasure in certain state which besides magnifying his dignity with strangers contributed to his personal pride and comfort wherefore the reader must not be misled by the frequent reference to his tent in the orch ard of palms he had there really respectable dowar that is to say he had there three large himself one visitors one his favorite wife and her women and six or eight lesser ones occupied by his servants and such tribal retainers he had chosen to bring with him men of approved courage and skillful with bow spear and horses to be sure his property of whatever kind was in danger at the orchard yet the habits of man go with him to town not less than the country and it is never wise to slip the bands of discipline the interior of the dowar was devoted to his cows camels goats and such property in general might tempt lion or thief to him full justice ilderim kept well all the customs of his people abating none not even the smallest in consequence his life at the orchard was continuation of his life in the desert nor that alone it was fair reproduction of the old patriarchal genuine pastoral life of primitive israel recurring to the morning the caravan arrived at the orchard here plant it here he said stopping his horse and thrusting spear into the ground door to the south the lake before it thus and these the children of the desert to sit under at the of the at the last words he went to group of three great and patted one of them he would have patted his horse s neck or the cheek of the child of his love who but the sheik could of right say to the caravan halt or of the tent here be it pitched the spear was wrested from the ground and over the wound it had riven in the sod the base of the ﬁrst pillar of the tent was planted marking the centre of the front door then eight others were all three rows of pillars three in row then at call the women and children came and unfolded the canvas from its packing on the camels who might this but the women had they not shear ed the hair from the brown goats of the ﬂock and twisted it into thread and woven the thread into cloth and stitched the cloth together making the perfect roof in fact though in the distance black the tents of kedar and ﬁnally with what jests and laughter and pulls altogether the united following of the sheik stretched the canvas from pillar to pillar driving the stakes and fastening the cords project gutenberg https went and when the walls of open reed matting were put in to the building after the style of the what hush of anxiety they waited the good man s judgment when he walked in and out looking at the house in connection with the sun the trees and the lake and said rubbing his hands with might of heartiness well done make the dowar now ye well know and we will sweeten the bread with arrack and the milk with honey and at every ﬁre there shall be kid god with ye want of sweet water there shall not be the lake is our well neither shall the bearers of burden hunger or the least of the ﬂock here is green pasture also god with you all my children and shouting the many happy went their ways then to pitch their own habitations few remained to arrange the interior the sheik and of these the hung curtain to the central row of pillars making two apartments the one on the right sacred to ilderim himself the other sacred to his jewels of they led in and with kisses and taps set at liberty against the middle pillar they then erected the and ﬁlled it with javelins and spears and bows arrows and shields outside of them hanging the master s sword modelled after the new moon and the glitter of its blade rivalled the glitter of the jewels bedded in its grip upon one end of the rack they hung the housings of the horses gay some of them the livery of king s servant while on the other end they displayed the great man s wearing robes woollen and robes linen his tunics and trousers and many colored kerchiefs the head nor did they give over the work until he pronounced it well meantime the women drew out and set up the divan more indispensable to him than the beard over his breast white aaron they put frame together in shape of three sides of square the opening to the door and covered it with cushions and base curtains and the cushions with changeable spread striped brown and yellow at the corners they placed pillows and bolsters sacked in cloth blue and crimson then around the divan they laid margin of carpet and the inner space they carpeted well and when the carpet was carried from the opening of the divan to the door of the tent their work was done whereupon they again waited until the master said it was good nothing remained then but to bring and ﬁll the jars with water and hang the skin bottles of arrack ready the the leben nor might an arab see why ilderim should not be both happy and his tent by the lake of sweet waters under the palms of the orchard of palms such was the tent at the door of which we left servants were already waiting the master s direction one of them took off his sandals another unlatched s roman shoes then the two exchanged their dusty outer garments fresh ones of white linen god s name enter and take thy rest said the host heartily in the dialect of the of jerusalem forthwith he led the way to the divan i will sit here he said next pointing and there the stranger the old time she would have been called and dexterously piled the pillows and bolsters rests the back after which they sat upon the side project gutenberg https divan while water was brought fresh from the lake and their feet bathed and dried with napkins we have saying in the desert ilder im began gathering his beard and combing it with his slender ﬁngers that good appetite is the promise of long life hast thou such by

stranger in the and say i ilderim send him prayer that his peace may be incessant the ﬂowing of the man in waiting bowed say also ilderim continued that i have returned with another breaking of bread and if balthasar the wise careth to share the loaf three may partake of it and the portion of the birds be none the the second servant went away let us take our rest now thereupon ilderim settled himself upon the divan at this day merchants sit on their rugs in the bazaa rs of damascus and when fairly at rest he stopped combing his beard and said gravely that thou art my guest and hast drunk my leben and art about to taste my salt ought not to forbid question who art thou sheik ilderim said calmly enduring his gaze i pray thee not to think triﬂing with thy just demand but was there never time in thy life when to answer such question would have been crime to thyself by the splendor of solomon yes ilderim answered betrayal of self is at times base the betrayal of thanks thanks good sheik exclaimed never answer became thee better now i know thou dost but seek assurance to justify the trust i have come to ask and that such assurance is of more interest to thee than the affairs of my poor the sheik in his turn bowed and hastened to pursue his advantage so it please thee then he said ﬁrst i am not roman the name given thee mine ilderim clasped the beard overﬂowing his breast and gazed at the speaker with eyes faintly twinkling through the shade of the heavy brows in the next place continued i am an israelite of the tribe of the sheik raised his brows little nor that merely sheik i am jew with grievance against rome compared with which thine is not more than child s the old man combed his beard with nervous haste and let fall his brows until even the twinkle of the eyes went out still further i swear to thee sheik swear by the covenant the lord made with my thou but give project gutenberg https i seek the money and the glory of the race shall be ilderim s brows relaxed his head arose his face began to beam and it was almost possible to see the satisfaction taking possession of him enough he said if at the roots of thy tongue there is lie in coil solomon himself had not been safe against thee that thou art not jew thou hast grievance against rome and revenge to compass i believe and on that score enough but to thy skill what experience hast thou in racing with chariots and the thou make them creatures of thy will know thee to come at call to go if thou sayest it to the last extreme of breath and strength and then in the perishing moment out of the depths of thy life thrill them to one exertion the mightiest of all the gift my son is not to every one ah by the splendor of god i knew king who governed millions of men their perfect master but could not win the respect of horse mark i speak not of the dull brutes whose round it is to slave debased in blood and image dead in spirit but of such mine kings of their kind of lineage reaching back to the broods of the ﬁrst pharaoh my comrades and friends dwellers in tents whom long associatio n with has brought up to my plane who to their instincts have added our wits and to their senses

measureless waste of sand with some treeless mountains and here and there well of bitter waters and said to him behold thy country and when the poor man complained the mighty one pitied him and said again be of cheer i will twice bless thee above other the arab heard and gave thanks and with faith set out to ﬁnd the blessings he travelled all the boundaries ﬁrst and failed then he made path into the desert and went on and in the heart of the waste there was an island of green very beautiful to see and in the heart of the island lo herd of camels and another of horses he took them joyfully and kept them with care what they best gifts of god and from that green isle went forth all the horses of the earth even to the pastures of nesaea they went and northward to the dreadful vales perpetua

six men appeared with chests of cedar reinforced by bands of brass and hinged and bolted with brass nay said ilderim when they were all set down by the divan i meant not all of them only the records of the one open it and take back the the chest was opened disclosing mass of ivory tablets strung on rings of silver wire and the tablets were scarcely thicker than wafers each ring held several hundreds of them i know said ilderim taking some of the rings in his i know with what care and zeal my son the scribes of the temple in the holy city keep the names of the newly born that every son of israel may trace his line of ancestry to its beginning though it antedate the patriarchs my the recollection of them be green forever not think it sinful to borrow the idea and apply it to their dumb servants see these tablets took the rings and separating the tablets saw they bore rude hieroglyphs in arabic burned on the smooth surface by sharp point of heated metal canst thou read them son of

certiﬁed history seldom of what stock all these are one and that now supplicating thy notice and caress and they come to us here their sires even the furthest removed in time came to my sires under like this of mine to eat their measure of barley from the open hand project gutenberg https talked to children and children kiss the thanks they have not speech to express and now son of israel thou mayst believe my i am lord of the desert behold my ministers take them from and i become sick man left by the caravan to die thanks to them age hath not diminished the terror of on the highways between cities and it will not while i have strength to go with them ha ha ha i could tell thee marvels done by their ancestors in favoring time i may so the present enough that they were never overtaken in retreat nor by the sword of solomon did they ever fail in pursuit that mark you on the sands and under saddle but not am afraid they are under yoke the ﬁrst time and the conditions of success are so many they have the pride and the speed and the endurance if i ﬁnd them master they will win son of israel so thou art the man i swear it shall be happy day that brought thee thither of thyself now i know now said why it is that in the love of an arab his horse is next to his children and i know also why the arab horses are the best in the world but good sheik i would not have you judge by words alone you know all promises of men sometimes fail give the trial ﬁrst on some plain hereabout and put the four in my hand ilderim s face beamed again and he would have spoken moment good sheik moment said let say further from the masters in rome i learned many lessons little thinking they would serve in time like this i tell thee these thy sons of the desert though they have separately the speed of eagles and the endurance of lions will fail if they are not trained to run together under the yoke bethink thee sheik in every four there is one the slowest and one the swiftest and while the race is always to the slowest the trouble is always with the swiftest it was so the driver could not reduce the best to harmonious action with the poorest my trial may have better result but if so i will tell thee of it that i swear wherefore in the same spirit i say can i get them to run together moved by my will the four one thou shalt have the sestertii and the crown and i my revenge what sayest thou ilderim listened combing his beard the while at the end he said with laugh i think better of thee son of israel we have saying in the desert if you will cook the meal with words i will promise an ocean of butter thou shalt have the horses in the at that moment there was stir at the rear entrance to the tent the is here and yonder my friend balthasar whom thou shalt know he hath story to tell which an israelite should never tire of and to the servants he added take the records away and return my jewels to their and they did he project gutenberg https xiv if the reader will return now to the repast of the wise men at their meeting in the desert he will unde rstand the preparations the supper in ilderim s tent the differences were chieﬂy such were incident to ampler means and better service three rugs were spread on the carpet within the space so nearly enclosed by the divan table not more than foot in height was brought and set within the same place and covered with cloth off to one side portable earthenware oven was established under the presidency of woman whose duty it was to keep the company in bread or more precisely in hot cakes of ﬂour from the handmills grinding with constant sound in neighboring tent meanwhile balthasar was conducted to the divan where ilderim and received him standing loose black gown covered his person his step was feeble and his whole movement slow and cautious apparently dependent upon long staff and the arm of servant peace to you my friend said ilderim respectfully peace and the egyptian raised his head and replied and to thee good thee and thine peace and the blessing of the one god the true and the manner was gentle and devout and impressed with feeling of awe besides which the blessing included in the answering salutation had been partly addressed to him and while that part was being spoken the eyes of the aged guest hollow yet luminous rested upon his face long enough to stir an emotion new and mysterious and so strong that he again and again during the repast scanned the much wrinkled and bloodless face its meaning but always there was the expression bland placid and trustful child little later he found that expression habitual this is he balthasar said the sheik laying his hand on s arm who will break bread with us this the egyptian glanced at the young man and looked again surprised and doubting seeing which the sheik continued i have promised him my horses trial and if all goes well he will drive them in the balthasar continued his gaze he came well recommended ilderim pursued much puzzled you may know him the son of arrius who was noble roman sailor though sheik hesitated then resumed with laugh though he declares himself an israe lite of the tribe of judah and by the splendor of god i believe what he tells balthasar could longer withhold explanation most generous sheik my life was in peril and would have been lost had not youth the counterpart of this indeed he be not the very when all others ﬂed and saved then he addressed directly art thou not he project gutenberg https i can not answer so far replied with modest deference i am he who stopped the horses of the insolent roman when they were rushing upon thy camel at the fountain of castalia thy daughter left cup with from the bosom of his tunic he produced the cup and gave it to balthasar glow lighted the faded countenance of the egyptian the lord sent thee to at the fountain he said in tremulous voice stretching his hand towards and he sends thee to now i give him thanks and praise him thou of his favor i have wherewith to give thee great reward and i will the cup is thine keep took back the gift and balthasar seeing the inquiry upon ilderim s face related the occurrence at the fountain what said the sheik to thou saidst nothing of this to when better recommendation thou couldst not have brought am i not an arab and sheik of my tribe of tens of thousands and is not he my guest and is it not in my that the good or evil thou dost him is good or evil done to whither shouldst thou go reward but here and whose the hand to give it but mine his voice at the end of the speech rose to cutting shrillness good sheik spare i pray i came not reward great or small and that i may be acquitted of the thought i say the help i gave this excellent man would have been given well to thy humblest but he is my friend my my servant and seest thou not in the difference the favor of fortun then to balthasar the sheik subjoined ah by the splendor of god i tell thee again he is not with that he turned away and gave attention to the servants whose preparations the supper were about complete the reader who recollects the history of balthasar given by himself at the meeting in the desert will understand the effect of s assertion of disinterestedness upon that worthy in his devotion to men there had been it will be remembered distinctions while the redemption which had been promised him in the way of redemption which he was was universal to him therefore the assertion sounded somewhat like an echo of himself he took step nearer and spoke to him in the childlike way how did the sheik say i should call you it was roman name i arrius the son of yet thou art not roman all my people were were saidst thou are they not living the question was subtle well simple but ilderim saved from reply come he said to them the meal is ready gave his arm to balthasar and conducted him to the table where shortly they were all seated on their rugs eastern fashion the lavers were brought them and they washed and project gutenberg https hands then the sheik made sign the servants stopped and the voice of the egyptian arose tremulous with holy feeling father of what we have is of thee take our thanks and bless us that we may continue to thy it was the grace the good man had said simultaneously with his brethren gaspar the greek and melchior the hindoo the utterance in diverse tongues out of which had come the miracle attesting the divine presence at the meal in the desert years before the table to which they immediately addressed themselves was may be thought rich in the substantials and delicacies favorite in the cakes hot from the oven vegetables from the gardens meats singly compounds of meats and vegetables milk of kine and honey and eaten or drunk it should be remarked without any of the modern forks spoons cups or plates and in this part of the repast but little was said they were hungry but when the dessert was in course it was otherwise they laved their hands again had the shaken out and with renewed table and the sharp edge of their appetites gone they were disposed to talk and listen with such arab jew and an egyptian all believers alike in one could be at that age but one subject of conversation and of the three which should be speaker but he to whom the deity had been so nearly personal appearance who had seen him in star had heard his voice in direction had been led so far and so miraculously by his spirit and of what should he talk but that of which he had been called to testify project gutenberg https xv the shadows cast over the orchard of palms by the mountains at set of sun left sweet margin time of violet sky and drowsing earth between the day and night the latter came early and swift and against its glooming in the tent this evening the servants brought four candlesticks of brass and set them by the corners of the table to each candlestick there were four branches and on each branch lighted silver lamp and supply cup of in light ample even brilliant the group at dessert continued their conversation speaking in the syriac dialect familiar to all peoples in that part of the world the egyptian told his story of the meeting of the three in the desert and agreed with the sheik that it was in december seven years before when he and his companions ﬂeeing from herod arrived at the tent praying shelter the narrative was heard with intense interest even the servants lingering when they could to catch its details received it became man listening to revelation of deep concern to all humanity and to none of more concern than the people of israel in his mind we shall presently see there was crystallizing an idea which was to change his course of life if not absorb it absolutely the recital proceeded the impression made by balthasar upon the young jew increased at its conclusion his feeling was too profound to permit doubt of its truth indeed there was nothing left him desirable in the connection but assurances if such were to be had pertaining exclusively to the consequences of the amazing event and now there is wanting an explanation which the very discerning may have heretofore demanded certainly it can be longer delayed our tale begins in point of date not less than fact to trench close upon the opening of the ministry of the son of mary whom we have seen but once since this same balthasar left him worshipfully in his mother s lap in the cave by bethlehem henceforth to the end the mysterious child will be subject of continual reference and slowly though surely the current of events with which we are dealing will bring us nearer and nearer to him until ﬁnally we see him would like if armed contrariety of opinion would permit it to man whom the world could not without of this declaration apparently so simple shrewd mind inspired by faith will make in welcome before his time and since there have been men indispensable to particular people and periods but his indispensability was to the whole race and all respect in which it is unique solitary divine to sheik ilderim the story was not new he had heard it from the three wise men together under circumstances which left room doubt he had acted upon it seriously the helping fugitive escape from the anger of the ﬁrst herod was dangerous now one of the three sat at his table again welcome guest and revered friend sheik ilderim certainly believed the story yet in the nature of things its mighty central fact could not come home project gutenberg https with the force and absorbing effect it came to he was an arab whose interest in the consequences was but general on the other hand was an israelite and jew with more than special interest the solecism can be truth of the fact he laid hold of the circumstance with purely jewish mind from his cradle let it be remembered he had heard of the messiah at the colleges he had been made familiar with all that was known of that being at once the hope the fear and the peculiar glory of the chosen people the prophets from the ﬁrst to the last of the heroic line foretold him and the coming had been and yet was the theme of endless exposition with the the synagogues in the schools in the temple of and in public and in private the national teachers expounded and kept expounding until all the children of abraham wherever their lots were cast bore the messiah in expectation and by it literally and with iron severity ruled and moulded their lives doubtless it will be understood from this that there was much argument among the jews themselves about the messiah and so there was but the disputation was all limited to one point and one would he come disquisition is the preacher wherea s the writer is but telling tale and that he may not lose his character the explanation he is making requires notice merely of point connected with the messiah about which the unanimity among the chosen people was matter of marvellous astonishment he was to be when come the king of the political king their cæsar by their instrumentality he was to make armed conquest of the earth and then their proﬁt and in the name of god hold it down forever on this faith dear reader the pharisees or latter being rather political the cloisters and around the altars of the temple built an ediﬁce of hope far overtopping the dream of the macedonian his but covered the earth theirs covered the earth and ﬁlled the skies that is to say in their bold boundless fantasy of blasphemous egotism god the almighty was in effect to suffer them their uses to nail him by the ear to door in sign of eternal servitude returning directly to it is to be observed now that there were two circumstances in his life the result of which had been to keep him in state comparatively free from the inﬂuence and hard effects of the audacious faith of his separatist countrymen in the ﬁrst place his father followed the faith of the sadducees who may in general way be termed the liberals of their time they had some loose opinions in denial of the soul they were strict constructionists and rigorous observers of the law found in the books of moses but they held the vast mass of rabbinical addenda to those books in derisive contempt they were unquestionably sect yet their religio n was more philosophy than creed they did not deny themsel ves the enjoyments of life and saw many admirable methods and productions among the gentile divisions of the race in politics they were the active opposition of the separatists in the natural order of things these circumstances and conditions opinions and peculiarities would have descended to the son certainly and really any portion of his father s estate and we have seen he was actually in course of acquiring them when the second saving event overtook project gutenberg https youth of s mind and temperament the inﬂuence of ﬁve years of afﬂuent life in rome can be appreciated best by recalling that the great city was then in fact the of the politically and commercially well the indulgence of pleasure without restraint round and round the golden in front of the in gloom of eclipse now in unapproachable all the active currents of humanity if excellences of manner reﬁnements of society attainments of intellect and glory of achievement made impression upon him how could he the son of arrius pass day after day through period so long from the beautiful villa near misenum into the receptions of cæsar and be wholly uninﬂuenced by what he saw there of kings princes ambassadors hostages and delegates suitors all of them from every known land waiting humbly the yes or which was to make or unmake them mere assemblages to be sure there was nothing to compare with the gatherings at jerusalem in celebration of the passover yet when he sat under the purple velaria of the circus maximus one of three hundred and ﬁfty thousand spectators he must have been visited by the thought that possibly there might be some branches of the family of man worthy divine consideration if not mercy though they were of the by their sorrows and yet worse by their hopelessness in the midst of sorrows ﬁtted brotherhood in the promises to his countrymen that he should have had such thought under such circumstances was but natural we think so much at least will be admitted but when the reﬂection came to him and he gave himself up to it he could not have been blind to certain distinction the wretchedness of the masses and their hopeless condition had relation whatever to religion their murmurs and groans were not against their gods or want of gods in the of britain the druids held their followers odin and freya maintained their godships in gaul and germany and among the hyperboreans egypt was satisﬁed with her crocodiles and anubis the persians were yet devoted to ormuzd and ahriman holding them in equal honor in hope of the nirvana the hindoos moved on patient ever in the rayless paths of brahm the beautiful greek mind in pauses of philosophy still sang the heroic gods of homer while in rome nothing was so common and cheap gods according to whim the masters of the world because they were masters carried their worship and offerings indifferently from altar to altar delighted in the pandemonium they had erected their discontent if they were discontented was with the number of gods after borrowing all the divinities of the earth they proceeded to deify their cæsars and vote them altars and holy service the unhappy condition was not from religion but misgovernment and usurpations and countless tyrannies the avernus men had been tumbled into and were praying to be relieved from was terribly but essentially political the alike in lodinum alexandria athens jerusa king to conquer with not god to worship studying the situation after two thousan d years we can see and say that religiously there was relief from the universal confusion except some god could prove himself true god and masterful one and come to the rescue but the people of the time even the discerning and philosophical discovered hope except in crushing rome that done the relief would follow project gutenberg https and reorganizations therefore they prayed conspired rebelled fought and died drenching the soil with blood morrow with always with the same result it remains to be said now that was in agreement with the mass of men of his time not romans the ﬁve years residence in the capital served him with opportunity to see and study the miseries of the subjugated world and in full belief that the evils which afﬂicted it were political and to be cured only by the sword he was going forth to ﬁt himself part in the day of resort to the heroic remedy by practice of arms he was perfect soldier but war has its higher ﬁelds and he who would move successfully in them must know more than to defend with shield and thrust with spear in those ﬁelds the general ﬁnds his tasks the greatest of which is the reduction of the many into one and that one himself the consummate captain is an armed with an army this conception entered into the scheme of life to which he was further swayed by the reﬂection that the vengeance he dreamed of in connection with his individual wrongs would be more surely found in some of the ways of war than in any pursuit of peace the feelings with which he listened to balthasar can be now understood the story touched two of the most sensitive points of his being so they rang within him his heart beat faster still when searching himself he found not doubt either that the recital was true in every particular or that the child so miraculously found was the messiah marvelling much that israel rested so dead to the revelation and that he had never heard of it before that day two questions presented themselves to him centring all it was at that moment further desirable to know where was the child then and what was his mission with apologies the interruptions he proceeded to draw out the opinions of balthasar who was in nowise loath to project gutenberg https xvi if i could answer you balthasar said in his simple earnest devout oh if i knew where he is how quickly i would go to him the seas should not stay nor the you have tried to ﬁnd him then asked smile ﬂitted across the face of the egyptian the ﬁrst task i charged myself with after leaving the shelter given in the desert cast grateful look at ilderim was to learn what became of the child but year had passed and i dared not go up to judea in person herod still held the throne ever in egypt upon my return there were few friends to believe the wond erful things i told them of what i had seen and few who rejoiced with that redeemer was few who never tired of the story some of them came up looking after the child they went ﬁrst to bethlehem and found there the khan and the cave but the steward who sat at the gate the night of the birth and the night we came following the gone the king had taken him away and he was more but they found some proofs surely said eagerly yes proofs written in village in mourning mothers yet crying their little ones you must know when herod heard of our ﬂight he sent down and slew the of the children of bethlehem not one escaped the faith of my messengers was conﬁrmed but they came to saying the child was dead slain with the other dead exclaimed aghast dead sayest thou nay my son i did not say so i said they my messengers told the child was dead i did not believe the report then i not believe it now i hast some special not so not so said balthasar dropping his gaze the spirit was to go with us farther than to the child when we came out of the cave after our presents were given and we had seen the babe we looked ﬁrst thing the star but it was gone and we knew we were left to ourselves the last inspiration of the holy last i can that which sent us to ilderim safety yes said the sheik ﬁngering his beard nervously you told you were sent to by remember i have special knowledge balthas ar continued observing the dejection which had fallen upon but my son i have given the matter much continuing through years inspired by faith which i assure you calling god witness is strong in now in the hour i heard the voice of the spirit calling by the shore of the lake if you will listen i will tell you why i believe the child is both ilderim and looked assent and appeared to summon their faculties that they might understand well project gutenberg https interest reached the servants who drew near to the divan and stood listening throughout the tent there was the profoundest silence we three believe in balthasar bowed his head he spoke and he is the truth he resumed his word is god the hills may turn to dust and the seas be drunk dry by south winds but his word shall stand because it is the the utterance was in manner inexpressibly solemn the voice which was his speaking to by the lake said blessed art thou son of mizraim the redemption cometh with two others from the remotenesses of the earth thou shalt see the savior i have seen the be his name the redemption which was the second part of the promise is yet to come seest thou now if the child be dead there is agent to bring the redemption about and the word is naught and nay i dare not say it he threw up both hands in horror the redemption was the work which the child was born and so long the promise abides not even death can separate him from his work until it is fulﬁlled or at least in the way of fulﬁlment take you that now one reason my belief then give further the good man paused wilt thou not taste the wine it is at thy said ilderim respectfully balthasar drank and seeming refreshed continued the savior i saw was born of woman in nature like us and subject to all our death let that stand the ﬁrst proposition consider next the work set apart to him was it not performance which only man is ﬁtted man wise ﬁrm man not child to become such he had to grow we grow bethink you now of the dangers his life was subject to in the long interval between childhood and maturity the existing powers were his enemies herod was his enemy and what would rome have been and he should not be accepted by israel was the motive cutting him off see you now what better way was there to take care of his life in the helpless growing time than by passing him into obscurity wherefore i say to myself and to my listening faith which is never moved except by yearning of say he is not dead but lost and his work remaining undone he will come again there you have the reasons my belief are they not good ilderim s small arab eyes were bright with understanding and lifted from his dejection said heartily i at least may not gainsay them what further pray hast thou not enough my son well he began in calmer tone seeing that the reasons were plainly seeing it was god s will that the child should not be settled my faith into the keeping of patience and took to he raised his eyes full of holy trust and broke off i am waiting now he lives keeping well his mighty secret what though i can not go to him or name the hill or the vale of his he may be the fruit in blossom it project gutenberg https the fruit just ripening but by the certainty there is in the promise and reason of god i know he thrill of awe struck thrill which was but the dying of his doubt where thinkest thou he is he asked in low voice and hesitating like one who feels upon his lips the pressure of sacred silence balthasar looked at him kindly and replied his mind not entirely freed from its abstraction in my house on the nile so close to the river that the by in boats see it and its reﬂection in the water at the same in my house few weeks ago i sat thinking man thirty years old i said to myself should have his ﬁelds of life all ploughed and his planting well done after that it is summer with space scarce enough to ripen his sowing the child i said further is now time to plant must be at hand i asked myself you here asked my son and answered by coming hither to good close by the land thy fathers had from god where else should he appear if not in judea in what city should he begin his work if not in jerusalem who should be ﬁrst to receive the blessings he is to bring if not the children of abraham isaac and jacob in love at least the children of the lord if i were bidden go seek him i would search well the hamlets and villages on the slopes of the mountains of judea and galilee falling eastwardly into the valley of the jordan he is there now standing in door or on only this even ing he saw the sun set one day nearer the time when he himself shall become the light of the balthasar ceased with his hand raised and ﬁnger pointing if at judea all the listeners even the dull servants outside the divan affected by his fervor were startled if by majestic presence suddenly apparent within the tent nor did the sensation die away at once of those at the table each sat awhile thinking the spell was ﬁnally broken by i see good balthasar he said that thou hast been much and strangely favored i see also that thou art wise man indeed it is not in my power to tell how grateful i am the things thou hast told i am warned of the coming of great events and borrow somewhat from thy faith complete the obligation i pray thee by telling further of the mission of him whom thou art waiting and whom from this night i too shall wait becomes believing son of judah he is to be savior thou saidst is he not to be king of the jews also my son said balthasar in his benignant way the mission is yet purpose in the bosom of god all i think about it is wrung from the words of the voice in connection with the prayer to which they were in answer shall we refer to them again thou art the teacher the cause of my disquiet balthasar began that which made preacher in alexandria and in the villages of the nile that which drove at last into the solitude where the spirit found the fallen condition of men occasioned i believed by loss of the knowledge of god i sorrowed the sorrows of my of one class but all of them so utterly were they fallen it seemed to there could be redemption unless god himself would make it his work and i prayed him project gutenberg https and that i might see him thy good works have conquered the redemption cometh thou shalt see the savior the voice spake and with the answer i went up to jerusalem rejoicing now to whom is the redemption to all the world and how shall it be strengthen thy faith my son men say i know that there will be happiness until rome is razed from her hills that is to say the ills of the time are not i thought them from ignorance of god but from the misgovernment of rulers we need to be told that human governments are neve r the sake of religion how many kings have you heard of who were better than their subjects oh the redemption can not be political pull down rulers and powe rs and vacate their places merely that others may take and enjoy them if that were all of it the wisdom of god would cease to be surpassing i tell you though it be but the saying of blind to blind he that comes is to be savior of souls and the redemption means god once more on earth and righteousness that his stay here may be tolerable to disappointment showed plainly on s head drooped and if he was not convinced he yet felt himself incapable that moment of disputing the opinion of the egyptian not so ilderim by the splendor of god he cried impulsively the judgment does away with all custom the ways of the world are ﬁxed and can not be changed there must be leader in every community clothed with power else there is balthasar received the burst gravely thy wisdom good sheik is of the world and thou dost forget that it is from the ways of the world we are to be redeemed man subject is the ambition of king the soul of man its salvation is the desire of ilderim though silenced shook his head unwilling to believe took up the ar gument him call thee such by permission he whom wert thou required to ask at the gates of jerusalem the sheik threw him grateful look i was to ask of the people said balthasar quietly where is he that is born king of the jews and you saw him in the cave by bethlehem we saw and worshipped him and gave him melchior gold gaspar frankincense and i when thou dost speak of fact father to hear thee is to believe said but in the matter of opinion i can not understand the kind of king thou wouldst make of the can not separate the ruler from his powers and son said balthasar we have the habit of studying closely the things which chance to lie at our feet giving but look at the greater objects in the distance thou seest now but the of the jews wilt thou lift thine eyes to the mystery beyond it the will disappear of the title word thy israel hath seen better in which god called thy people endearingly his people and dealt with them through prophets now if in those days he promised them the savior i promised him king of the appearance must be according to the promise if only the word s sake ah project gutenberg https the reason of my question at the gate seest and i will more of it but pass on it may be next thou art regarding the dignity of the child if so bethink is it to be successor of herod the world s standard of honor what could not god better by his beloved if thou canst think of the almighty father in want of title and stooping to borrow the inventions of men why was i not bidden ask cæsar at once oh the substance of that whereof we speak look higher i pray thee ask rather of what he whom we await shall be king i tell my son that is the key to the mystery which man shall understand without the key balthasar raised his eyes devoutly there is kingdom on the earth though it is not of kingdom of wider bounds than the than the sea and the earth though they were rolled together ﬁnest gold and spread by the beating of hammers its existence is fact our hearts are facts and we journey through it from birth to death without seeing it nor shall any man see it until he hath ﬁrst known his own soul the kingdom is not him but his soul and in its dominion there is glory such hath not entered imagination incomparable impossible of what thou sayest father is riddle to said i never heard of such nor did i said ilderim and i may not tell more of it balthasar added humbly dropping his eyes what it is what it is how it may be reached none can know until the child comes to take possession of it his own he brings the key of the viewless gate which he will open his beloved among whom will be all who love him of such only the redeemed will after that there was long silence which balthasar accepted the end of the conversation good sheik he said in his placid way or the next day i will go up to the city time my daughter wishes to see the preparations the games i will speak further about the time of our going and my son i will see you again to you both peace and they all arose from the table the sheik and remained looking after the egyptian until he was conducted out of the tent sheik ilderim said then i have heard strange things tonight give leave i pray to walk by the lake that i may think of go and i will come after they washed their hands again after which at sign from the master servant brought his shoes and directly he went project gutenberg

hour he dismounted man whom he recognized of his own tribe came to him and said sheik i was bidden give thee this package with request that thou read it at once if there be answer i was to wait thy

missive been in greek or arabi c he could have read it it was the utmost he could make out was the signature in bold roman his eyes twinkled where is the young jew he asked in the ﬁeld with the horses servant replied the sheik replaced the papyrus in its envelopes and tucking the package under his girdle remounted the horse that moment stranger made his appearance coming apparently from the city i am looking sheik ilderim surnamed the generous the stranger said his language and attire bespoke him roman what he could not read he yet could speak so the old arab answered with dignity i am sheik the man s eyes fell he raised them again and said with forced composure i heard you had need of driver the ilderim s lip under the white mustache curled contemptuously go thy way he said i have driver he turned to ride away but the man lingering spoke again sheik i am lover of horses and they say you have the most beautiful in the the old man was touched he drew rein if on the point of yielding to the ﬂattery but ﬁnally replied not not some other time i will show them to you i am too busy just now he rode to the ﬁeld while the stranger betook himself to town again with smiling countenance he had accomplished his mission and every day thereafter down to the great day of the games two or three to the sheik at the orchard pretending to seek an engagement driver in such manner messala kept watch over project gutenberg https v the sheik waited well satisﬁed until drew his horses off the ﬁeld the satisﬁed he had seen them after being put through all the other paces run full speed in such manner that it did not seem there were one the slowest and another the in other words if the four were one this afternoon sheik i will give sirius back to hur patted the neck of the old horse he spoke i will give him back and take to the so soon ilderim asked with such these good sheik one day sufﬁces they are not afraid they have man s intelligence and they love the exercise this one he shook rein over the back of the youngest of the you called him aldebaran i the swiftest in once round stadium he would lead the others thrice his ilderim pulled his beard and said with twinkling eyes aldebaran is the swiftest but what of the slowest this is shook the rein over antares this is he but he will win look you sheik he will run his utmost all day day and the sun goes down he will reach his right again said ilderim i have but one fear the sheik became doubly serious in his greed of triumph roman can not keep honor pure in the of them mark tricks are inﬁnite in chariot racing their knavery extends to horse to driver from driver to master wherefore good sheik look well to all thou hast from this till the trial is over let stranger so much see the horses would you be perfe ctly safe watch over them with armed hand well sleepless eye then i will have fear of the at the door of the tent they dismounted what you say shall be attended to by the splendor of god hand shall come near them except it belong to one of the faithful i will set watches but son of arrius drew forth the package and opened it slowly while they walked to the divan and seated son of arrius see thou here and help with thy he passed the despatch to there read aloud rendering what thou ﬁndest into the tongue of thy fathers latin is an was in good spirits and began the reading carelessly messala to gra tus he paused premonition drove the blood to his heart ilderim observed his agitation well i am prayed pardon and recommenced the paper which it is sufﬁcient to say was one of the duplicates of the project gutenberg https so carefully to gratus by messala the morning after the revel in the palace the paragraphs in the beginning were remarkable only proof that the writer had not outgrown his habit of mockery when they were passed and the reader came to the parts intended to refresh the memory of gratus his voice trembled and twice he stopped to regain his by strong effort he continued i recall further he read that thou didst make disposition of the family of hur the reader again paused and drew long breath both of us at the time supposing the plan hit upon to be the most effective possible the purposes in view which were silence and delivery over to inevitable but natural here broke down utterly the paper fell from his hands and he covered his face they are i alone am the sheik had been silent but not unsympathetic witness of the young man s suffering now he arose and said son of arrius it is to beg thy pardon read the paper by thyself when thou art strong enough to give the rest of it to send word and i will he went out of the tent and nothing in all his life became him better ﬂung himself on the divan and gave way to his feelings when somewhat recovered he recollected that portion of the letter remained unread and taking it up he resumed the reading thou wilt remember the missive ran what thou didst with the mother and sister of the malefactor yet if now i yield to desire to learn if they be living or dead started and read again and then again and at last broke into exclamation he does not know they are dead he does not know it blessed be the name of the lord there is yet he ﬁnished the sentence and was strengthened by it and went on bravely to the end of the letter they are not dead he said after reﬂection they are not dead or he would have heard of second reading more careful than the ﬁrst conﬁrmed him in the opinion then he sent the sheik in coming to your hospitable tent sheik he said calmly when the arab was seated and they were alone it was not in my mind to speak of myself further than to assure you i had sufﬁcient training to be intrusted with your horses i declined to tell you my history but the chances which have sent this paper to my hand and given it to to be read are so strange that i feel bidden to trust you with everything and i am the more inclined to so by knowledge here conveyed that we are both of us threatened by the same enemy against whom it is needful that we make common cause i will read the letter and give you explanation after which you will not wonder i was so moved if you thought weak or childish you will then excuse the sheik held his peace listening closely until came to the paragraph in which he was particularly mentioned i saw the jew yesterday in the grove of daphne so ran the part and if he be not there now he is certainly in the neighborhood making it easy to keep him in eye indeed wert thou to ask where he is now i should say with the most positive assurance he is to be found at the old orchard of project gutenberg https exclaimed ilderim in such tone one might hardly say he was more surprised than angry at the same time he clutched his beard at the old orchard of palms repeated under the tent of the traitor shiek traitor the old man cried in his shrillest tone while lip and beard curled with ire and on his forehead and neck the veins swelled and beat they would burst yet moment sheik said with deprecatory gesture such is messala s opinion of you hear his and he read under the tent of the traitor sheik ilderim who can not long escape our strong hand be not surprised if maxentius his ﬁrst measure places the arab on ship forwarding to to rome of ten thousand horsemen with to rome he leaped rather than rose to his feet his arms outstretched his ﬁngers spread and curved like claws his eyes glittering like serpent god by all the gods except of rome shall this insolence end freeman am i free are my people must we die slaves or worse must i live dog crawling to master s feet must i lick his hand lest he lash what is mine is not mine i am not my own breath of body i must be beholden to roman oh if i were young again oh could i shake off twenty ﬁve he ground his teeth and shook his hand s overhead then under the impulse of another idea he walked away and back again to swiftly and caught his shoulder with strong grasp if i were thou son of young strong practised in arms if i had motive hissing to motive like thine great enough to make hate away with disguise on thy part and on mine son of hur son of hur i at that name all the currents of s blood stopped surprised bewildered he gazed into the arab s eyes now close to his and ﬁercely bright son of hur i say were i thou with half thy wrongs bearing about with memories like thine i would not i could not never pausing his words following each other the old man swept on to all my grievances i would add those of the world and devote myself to vengeance from land to land i would go ﬁring all mankind war freedom but should ﬁnd engaged battle against rome in which i would not bear part i would turn parthian if i could not bette if men failed still i would not give over the ha ha by the splendor of god

quarter i would not ask quarter i would not give to the ﬂames everything roman to the sword every roman born of nights i would pray the gods the good and the bad alike to lend their special drought heat cold and all the nameless poisons they let loose in air all the thousand things of which men die on sea and on land oh i could not sleep project gutenberg https sheik stopped want of breath panting wringing his hands and sooth to say of all the passionate burst retained but vague impression wrought by ﬁery eyes piercing voice and rage too intense coherent expression the ﬁrst time in years the desolate youth heard himself addressed by his proper name one man at least knew him and acknowledged it without demand of identity and he an arab fresh from the desert how came the man by his knowledge the letter it told the cruelties from which his family had suffered it told the story of his own misfortunes but it did not say he was the very victim whose escape from doom was the theme of the heartless narrative that was the point of explanation he had notiﬁed the sheik would follow the reading of the letter he was pleased and thrilled with hope restored yet kept an air of calmness good sheik tell how you came by this letter my people keep the roads between cities ilderim answered bluntly they took it from courier are they known to be thy people to the world they are robbers whom it is mine to catch and slay again sheik you call son of father s name i did not think myself known to person on earth how came you by the knowledge ilderim hesitated but rallying he answ ered i know you yet i am not free to tell you some one holds you in restraint the sheik closed his mouth and walked away but observing s disappointment he came back and said let us say more about the matter now i will go to town when i return i may talk to you fully give the letter ilderim rolled the papyrus carefully restored it to its envelopes and became once more all ener gy what sayest thou he asked while waiting his horse and retinue i told what i would were i thou and thou hast made answer i intended to answer sheik and i s countenance and voice changed with the feeling invoked all thou hast said i will at least in the power of man i devoted myself to vengeance long ago every hour of the ﬁve years passed i have lived with other thought i have taken respite i have had pleasures of youth the blandishments of rome were not i wanted her to educate revenge i resorted to her most famous masters and t those of rhetoric or philosophy alas i had time them the arts essential to were my desire i associated with gladiators and with winners of prizes in the circus and they were my teachers the in the great camp accepted scholar and were proud of my attainments in their line sheik i am soldier but the things of which i dream require to be captain with that thought i have taken part in the campaign against the parthians when it is over then if the lord spare my life and then raised his clenched hands and spoke vehemently then i will be an enemy in all things then project gutenberg https account to in roman lives her ills you have my answer ilderim put an arm over his shoulder and kissed him saying passionately if thy god favor thee not son of hur it is because he is dead take thou this from orn to if so thy preference run thou shalt have my hands and their horses camels and the desert preparation i swear it the present enough thou shalt see or hear from before turning abruptly off the sheik was speedily on the road to the project gutenberg https vi the intercepted letter was conclusive upon number of points of great interest to it had all the effect of confession that the writer was party to the of the family with murderous intent that he had sanctione d the plan adopted the purpose that he had received portion of the proceeds of the conﬁscation and was yet in enjoyment of his part that he dreaded the unexpected appearance of what he was pleased to call the chief malefactor and accepted it menace that he contemplated such further action would secure him in the future and was ready to whatever his accomplice in cæsarea might advise and now that the letter had reached the hand of him really its subject it was notice of danger to come well confession of guilt so when ilderim left the tent had much to think about requiring immediate action his enemies were adroit and powerful any in the east if they were afraid of him he had greater reason to be afraid of them he strove earnestly to reﬂect upon the situation but could not his feelings constantly overwhelmed him there was certain qualiﬁed pleasure in the assurance that his mother and sister were alive and it mattered little that the foundation of the assurance was mere inference that there was one person who could tell him where they were seemed to his hope so long deferred if discovery were now close at hand these were mere causes of feeling underlying them it must be confessed he had superstitious fancy that god was about to make ordination in his behalf in which event faith whispered him to stand still occasionally referring to the words of ilderim he wondered whence the arab derived his information about him not from malluch certainly nor from simonides whose interests all adverse would hold him dumb could messala have been the informant disclosure might be dangerous in that quarter conjecture was vain at the same time often was beaten back from the solution he was consoled with the thought that whoever the person with the knowledge might be he was friend and being such would reveal himself in good time little more little more patience possibly the errand of the sheik was to see the worthy possibly the letter might precipitate full disclosure and patient he would have been if only he could have believed tirzah and his mother were waiting him under circumstances permitting hope on their part strong his if in other words conscience had not stung him with accusations respecting them to escape such accusations he wandered far through the orchard pausing now where the were busy yet not too busy to offer him of their fruit and talk with him then under the great trees to watch the nesting birds or hear the bees swarming about the berries bursting with honeyed sweetness and ﬁlling all the green and golden spaces with the music of their beating project gutenberg https the lake however he lingered longest he might not look upon the water and its sparkling ripples so like sensuous life without thinking of the egyptian and her marvellous beauty and of ﬂoating with her here and there through the night made brilliant by her songs and stories he might not forget the charm of her manner the lightness of her laugh the ﬂattery of her attention the warmth of her little hand under his upon the tiller of the boat from her it was his thought but short way to balthasar and the strange things of which he had been witness unaccountable by any law of nature and from him again to the king of the jews whom the good man with such pathos of patience was holding in holy promise the distance was even nearer and there his mind stayed ﬁnding in the mysteries of that personage satisfaction answering well the rest he was seeking because it may have been nothing is so easy denial of an idea not agreeable to our wishes he rejected the deﬁnition given by balthasar of the kingdom the king was coming to establish kingdom of souls if not intolerable to his sadducean faith seemed to him but an abstraction drawn from the depths of devotion too fond and dreamy kingdom of judea on the other hand was more than comprehensible such had been and if only that reason might be again and it suited his pride to think of new kingdom broader of domain richer in power and of more unapproachable splendor than the old one of new king wiser and mightier than solomon new king under whom especially he could ﬁnd both service and revenge in that mood he resumed to the dowar the meal disposed of still further to occupy himself had the chariot rolled out into the sunlight inspection the word but poorly conveys the careful study the vehicle underwent point or part of it escaped him with pleasure which will be better understood hereaft er he saw the pattern was greek in his judgment preferable to the roman in many respects it was wider between the wheels and lower and stronger and the disadvantage of greater weight would be more than compensated by the greater endurance of his arabs speaking generally the of rome built the games almost solely sacriﬁcing safety to beauty and durability to grace while the chariots of achilles and the king of men designed war and all its extreme tests still ruled the tastes of those who met and struggled the crowns isthmian and olympic next he brought the horses and hitching them to the chariot drove to the ﬁeld of exercise where hour after hour he practised them in movement under the yoke when he came away in the evening it was with restored spirit and ﬁxed purpose to defer action in the matter of messala until the race was won or lost he could not forego the pleasure of meeting his adversary under the eyes of the east that there might be other competitors seemed not to enter his thought his conﬁdence in the result was absolute doubt of his own skill and to the four they were his full partners in the glorious game let him look to it let him look to it ha shall he not honest rigel and thou atair king among coursers shall he not beware of us ha ha good hearts so in rests he passed from horse to horse speaking not master but the senior of many brethren after nightfall sat by the door of the tent waiting ilderim not yet returned from the city he was not impatient project gutenberg https or doubtful the sheik would be heard from at least indeed whether it was from satisfaction with the performance of the four or the refreshment there is in cold water succeeding bodily exercise or supper partaken with royal appetite or the reaction which kindly provision of nature always follows depression the young man was in verging upon elation he felt himself in the hands of providence longer his enemy at last there was sound of horse s feet coming rapidly and malluch rode up son of arrius he said cheerily after salutation i salute you sheik ilderim who requests you to mount and go to the city he is waiting asked questions but went in where the horses were feeding aldebaran came to him if offering his service he played with him lovingly but passed on and chose another not of the were sacred to the race very shortly the two were on the road going swiftly and in silence some distance below the seleucian bridge they crossed the river by ferry and riding far round on the right bank and recrossing by another ferry entered the city from the west the detour was long but accepted it precaution which there was good reason down to simonides landing they rode and in front of the great warehouse under the bridge malluch drew rein we are come he said recognized the place where is the sheik he asked come with i will show watchman took the horses and almost before he realized it stood once more at the door of the house up on the greater one listening to the response from in god s name enter project gutenberg https vii malluch stopped at the door entered alone the room was the same in which he had formerly interviewed simonides and it had been in nowise changed except now close by the polished brazen rod set on broad wooden pedestal arose higher than tall man holding lamps of silver on sliding arms or more in number and all burning the light was clear bringing into view the panelling on the walls the cornice with its row of gilded balls and the dome dully tinted with violet mica within few steps stopped three persons were present looking at ilderim and esther he glanced hurriedly from one to another if to ﬁnd answer to the question half formed in his mind what business can these have with he became calm with every sense on the alert the question was succeeded by another are they friends or enemies at length his eyes rested upon esther the men returned his look kindly in her face there was something more than ething too spirituel deﬁnition which yet went to his inner consciousness without deﬁnition shall it be said good reader back of his gaze there was comparison in which the egyptian arose and set herself over against the gentle jewess but it lived an instant and is the habit of such comparisons passed away without conclusion son of the guest turned to the speaker son of hur said simonides repeating the address slowly and with distinct emphasis if to impress all its meaning upon him most interested in understanding it take thou the peace of the lord god of our it from he paused then added from and the speaker sat in his chair there were the royal head the bloodless face the masterful air under the inﬂuence of which visitors forgot the broken limbs and distorted body of the man the full black eyes gazed out under the white brows steadily but not sternly moment thus then he crossed his hands upon his breast the action taken with the salutation could not be misunderstood and was not simonides answered much moved the holy peace you tender is accepted son to father i return it to you only let there be perfect understanding between thus delicately he sought to put aside the submission of the merchant and in place of the relation of master and servant substitute one higher and holier simonides let fall his hands and turning to esther said seat the master daughter project gutenberg https hastened and brought stool and stood with suffused face looking from one to the to simonides from simonides to and they waited each declining the superiority direction would imply when at length the pause began to be embarrassing advanced and gently took the stool from her and going to the chair placed it at the merchant s feet i will sit here he said his eyes met instant only but both were better of the look he recognized her gratitude she his generosity and forbearance simonides bowed his acknowledgment esther child bring the paper he said with breath of relief she went to panel in the wall opened it took out roll of papyri and brought and gave it to him thou saidst well son of hur simonides began while unrolling the sheets let us understand each other in anticipation of the i would have made hadst thou waived have here statement covering everything necessary to the understanding required i could see but two points property ﬁrst and then our relation the statement is explicit to both will it please thee to read it now received the papers but glanced at ilderim nay said simonides the sheik shall not deter thee from reading the thou wilt ﬁnd of nature requiring witness in the attesting place at the end thou wilt ﬁnd when thou comest to it the sheik he knows all he is thy friend all he has been to that will he be to thee simonides looked at the arab nodding pleasantly and the latter gravely returned the nod saying thou hast replied i know already the excellence of his friendship and have yet to prove myself worthy of immediately he continued later simonides i will read the papers carefully the present thou take them and if thou be not too weary give their simonides took back the roll here esther stand by and receive the sheets lest they fall into she took place by his chair letting her right arm fall lightly across his shoulder so when he

law daughter followed the parent s condition in all his visions of her the esther had ﬁgured the rival of the egyptian and an object of possible love he shrank from the revelation so suddenly brought him and looked at her blushing and blushing she dropped her eyes before him then he said while the papyrus rolled itself together man with six hundred talents is indee d rich and may what he pleases but rarer than the money more priceless than the property is the mind which amassed the wealth and the heart it could not corrupt when amassed thou fair not sheik ilderim here shall be witness that in the same moment ye were declared my servants that moment i declared ye free and what i declare that will i put in writing is it not enough can i more son of hur said simonides verily thou dost make servitude lightsome i was wrong there are some things thou canst not thou canst not make us free in law i am thy servant forever because i went to the door with thy father one day and in my ear the yet did my father that judge him not cried simonides quickly he accepted servant of that class because i prayed him to so i never repented the step it was the price i paid rachel the mother of my child here rachel who would not be my wife unless i became what she was she servant forever even walked the ﬂoor in pain of impotent wish i was rich before he said stopping suddenly i was rich with the gifts of the generous arrius now comes this greater fortune and the mind which achieved it is there not purpose of god in it all counsel simonides help to see the right and it help to be worthy my

with the father and i will not more from the son and now if the understanding be perfect paused it is with said and thou daughter of rachel speak said simonides lifting her arm from his shoulder esther left thus alone stood moment abashed her color coming and going then she went to and said with womanliness singularly sweet i am not better than my mother was and she is gone i pray you my master let care my father took her hand and led her back to the chair saying thou art good child have thy simonides replaced her arm upon his neck and there was silence time in the project gutenberg https viii simonides looked up none the less master esther he said quietly the night is going fast and lest we become too weary that which is before us let the refreshments be she rang bell servant answered with wine and bread which she bore round the understanding good my master continued simonides when all were served is not perfect in my sight henceforth our lives will run on together like rivers which have met and joined their waters i think their ﬂowing will be better if every cloud is blown from the sky above them you left my door the other day with what seemed denial of the claims which i have just allowed in the broadest terms but it was not so indeed it was not esther is witness that i recognized you and that i did not abandon you let malluch say malluch exclaimed one bound to chair like must have many hands reaching if he would move the world from which he is so cruelly barred i have many such and malluch is one of the best of them and sometimes cast grateful glance at the sheik sometimes i borrow from others good of heart like ilderim the and brave let him say if i either denied or forgot looked at the arab this is he good ilderim this is he who told you of ilderim s eyes twinkled he nodded his answer how my master said simonides may we without trial tell what man is i knew you i saw your father in you but the kind of man you were i did not know there are people to whom fortune is curse in disguise were you of them i sent malluch to ﬁnd out and in the service he was my eyes and ears not blame him he brought report of you which was all i not said heartily there was wisdom in your the words are very pleasant to said the merchant with feeling very pleasant my fear of misunderstanding is laid let the rivers run on now god may give them after an interval he continued i am compelled now by truth the weaver sits weaving and the shuttle ﬂies the cloth increases and the ﬁgures grow and he dreams dreams meanwhile so to my hands the fortune grew and i wondered at the increase and asked myself about it many times i could see care not my own went with the enterprises i set going the simooms which smote others on the desert jumped over the things which were mine the storms which heaped the seashore with wrecks did but blow my ships the sooner into port strangest of all i so dependent upon others ﬁxed to place like project gutenberg https had never loss by an ver the elements stooped to serve and all my servants in fact were it is very strange said so i said and kept saying finally my master ﬁnally i came to be of your was in like you i asked what can his purpose be intelligence is never wasted intelligence like god s never stirs except with design i have held the question in heart lo these many years watching an answer i felt sure if god were in it some day in his own good time in his own way he would show his purpose making it clear whited house upon hill and i believe he has done listened with every faculty intent many years ago with my y mother was with esther beautiful morning over old sat by the wayside out north of jerusalem near the tombs of the kings when three men passed by riding great white camels such had never been seen in the holy city the men were strangers and from far countries the ﬁrst one stopped and asked question where is he that is born king of the jews if to allay my wonder he went on to say we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship i could not understand but followed them to the damascus gate and of every person they met on the the guard at the gate asked the question all who heard it were amazed like in time i forgot the circumstance though there was much talk of it presage of the messiah alas alas what children we are even the wisest when god walks the earth his steps are often centuries apart you have seen balthasar and heard him tell his story said miracle very miracle cried simonides he told it to good my master i seemed to hear the answer i had so long waited god s purpose burst upon poor will the king be when he and friendless without following without armies without cities or castles kingdom to be set up and rome reduced and blotted out see see my master thou ﬂushed with strength thou trained to arms thou burdened with riches behold the opportunity the lord hath sent thee shall not his purpose be thine could man be born to more perfect glory simonides put his whole force in the appeal but the kingdom the kingdom answered eagerly balthasar says it is to be of the pride of the jew was strong in simonides and therefore the slightly contemptuous curl of the lip with which he began his reply balthasar has been witness of wonderful miracles my master and when he speaks of them i bow with belief they are of sight and sound personal to him but he is son of mizraim and not even proselyte hardly may he be supposed to have special knowledge by virtue of which we must bow to him in matter of god s dealing with our israel the prophets had their light from heaven directly even he had to one and jehovah the same forever i must believe the the torah esther he proceeded without waiting her may the testimony of whole people be slighted my master though you travel from tyre which is by the sea in the north project gutenberg https capital of edom which is in the desert south you will not ﬁnd lisper of the shema an in the temple or any one who has ever eaten of the lamb of the passover to tell you the kingdom the king is coming to build us the children of the covenant is other than of this world like our father david now where got they the faith ask you we will see presently esther here returned bringing number of rolls carefully enveloped in linen lettered quaintly in gold keep them daughter to give to i call them the father said in the tender voice he always used in speaking to her and continued his ar gument it were long good my long to repeat to you the names of the holy men who in the providence of god succeeded the prophets only little less favored than the seers who have written and the preachers who have taught since the captivity the very wise who borrowed their lights from the lamp of malachi the last of his line and whose great names hillel and shammai never tired of repeating in the colleges will you ask them of the kingdom thus the lord of the sheep in the book of is he who but the king of whom we are speaking throne is set up him he smites the earth and the other kings are shaken from their thrones and the scour ges of israel ﬂung into cavern of ﬁre ﬂaming with pillars of ﬁre so also the singer of the psalms of behold lord and raise up to israel their king the son of david at the time thou knowest god to rule israel thy children and he will bring the peoples of the heathen under his yoke to serve him and he shall be righteous king taught of god he shall rule all the earth by the word of his mouth forever and last though not least hear ezra the second moses in his visions of the night and ask him who is the lion with human voice that says to the is thou hast loved liars and overthrown the cities of the industrious and razed their walls though they did thee harm therefore begone that the earth may be refreshed and recover itself and hope in the justice and piety of him who made whereat the eagle was seen more surely my master the testimony of these should be enough but the way to the fountain s head is open let us go up to it at wine esther and then the dost thou believe the prophets master he asked after drinking i know thou dost of such was the faith of all thy esther the book which hath in it the visions of he took one of the rolls which she had unwrapped him and read the people that walked in darkness have seen great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined unto us child is born unto us son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder of the increase of his government and peace there shall be end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever thou the prophets my master esther the word of the lord that came to she gave him the roll he asked but thou he began but thou bethlehem ephrath though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of project gutenberg https he come forth unto that is to be ruler in was he the very child balthasar saw and worshipped in the cave believest thou the prophets my master esther the words of receiving that roll he read before behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise unto david righteous branch and king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely king he shall king my master believest thou the prophets daughter the roll of the sayings of that son of judah in whom there was she gave him the book of daniel hear my master he said i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and there was given him dominion and glory and kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be thou the prophets my master it is enough i believe cried what then asked simonides if the king come poor will not my master of his abundance give him help help him to the last shekel and the last breath but why speak of his coming poor give esther the word of the lord it came to zechariah said simonides she gave him one of the rolls hear how the king will enter then he read rejoice greatly daughter of zion behold thy king cometh unto thee with justice and salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon colt the foal of an looked away what see you my master rome he answered ro and her legions i have dwelt with them in their camps i know ah said simonides thou shalt be master of legions the king with millions to choose millions cried simonides sat moment thinking the question of power should not trouble you he next said looked at him inquiringly you were seeing the lowly king in the act of coming to his own simonides seeing him on the right hand it were and on the left the brassy legions of cæsar and you were asking what can he it was my very my master simonides continued you not know how strong our israel is you think of him sorrowful old man weeping by the rivers of babylon but go up to jerusalem next passover and stand on the xystus or in the street of barter and see him he is the promise of the lord to father jacob coming out of was law under which our people have not ceased even in captivity they grew under foot project gutenberg https egyptian the clench of the roman has been but wholesome nurture to them now they are indeed nation and company of nor that only my master in fact to measure the strength of is in fact measuring what the king can shall not bide solely by the rule of natural increase but add thereto the mean the spread of the faith which will carry you to the far and near of the whole known earth further the habit is i know to think and speak of jerusalem israel which may be likened to our ﬁnding an embroidered shred and holding it up magisterial robe of cæsar s jerusalem is but stone of the temple or the heart in the body turn from beholding the legions strong though they be and count the hosts of the faithful waiting the old alarm to your tents israel the many in persia children of those who chose not to return with the returning count the brethren who swarm the marts of egypt and farther africa count the hebrew colonists eking proﬁt in the lodinum and the of spain count the pure of blood and the proselytes in greece and in the isles of the sea and over in pontus and here in antioch and that matter those of that city lying accursed in the shadow of the unclean walls of rome herself count the worshippers of the lord dwelling in tents along the deserts next us well in the deserts beyond the nile and in the regions across the caspian and up in the old lands of gog and magog even separate those who annually send gifts to the holy temple in acknowledgment of them that they may be counted also and when you have done counting lo my master census of the sword hands that await you lo kingdom ready fashioned him who is to judgme nt and justice in the whole earth rome not less than in zion have then the answer what israel can that can the the picture was fervently given upon ilderim it operated like the blowing of trumpet oh that i had back my youth he cried starting to his feet sat still the speech he saw was an invitation to devote his life and fortune to the mysterious being who was palpably much the centre of great hope with simonides with the devout egyptian the idea we have seen was not new one but had come to him repeatedly once while listening to malluch in the grove of daphne afterwards more distinctly while balthasar was giving his conception of what the kingdom was to be still later in the walk through the old orchard it had risen almost if not quite into resolve at such times it had come and gone only an idea attended with feelings more or less acute not so now master had it in charge master was working it up already he had exalted it into cause brilliant with possibilities and inﬁnitely holy the effect was if door theretofore unseen had suddenly opened ﬂooding with light and admitting him to service which had been his one perfect service reaching far into the future and rich with the rewards of duty done and prizes to sweeten and soothe his ambition one touch more was needed let us concede all you say simonide s said that the king will come and his kingdom be solomon s say also i am ready to give myself and all i have to him and his cause yet more say that i should was god s purpose in the ordering of my life and in your quick amassment of astonishing fortune then what shall we proceed like blind men building shall we wait project gutenberg https king comes or until he sends you have age and experience on your side answer simonides answered at once we have choice none this letter produced messala s despatch he this letter is the signal action the alliance proposed between messala and gratus we are not strong enough to resist we have not the inﬂue nce at rome nor the force here they will kill you if we wait how merciful they are look at and he shuddered at the terrible recollection good my master he continued recovering himself how strong are purpose i mean did not understand him i remember how pleasant the world was to in my youth simonides proceeded yet said you were capable of great yes has not life other motives strong simonides shook his head there is ambition is forbidden son of what then of revenge the spark dropped upon the inﬂammable passion the man s eyes gleamed his hands shook he answered quickly revenge is jew s of right it is the law camel even dog will remember wrong cried ilderim directly simonides picked up the broken thread of his thought there is work work the king which should be done in advance of his coming we may not doubt that israel is to be his right hand but alas it is hand of peace without cunning in war of the millions there is not one traine d band not captain the mercenaries of the herods i not coun t they are kept to crush us the condition is the roman would have it his policy has fruited well his tyranny but the time of change is at hand when the shepherd shall put on armor and take to spear and sword and the feeding ﬂocks be turned to ﬁghting lions some one my son must have place next the king at his right hand who shall it be if not he who does this work well s face ﬂushed at the prospect though he said i see but speak plainly deed to be done is one thing how to it is another simonides sipped the wine esther brought him and replied the sheik and thou my master shall be principals each with part i will remain here carrying on now and watchful that the spring go not dry thou shalt betake thee to jerusalem and thence to the wilderness and begin numbering the of israel and telling them into tens and hundreds and choosing captains and training them and in secret places hoarding arms which i shall keep thee supplied commencing over in perea thou shalt go then to galilee whence it is but step to jerusalem in perea the desert will be at thy back and ilderim in reach of thy hand he will keep the roads so that nothing shall pass without thy knowledge he will help thee in many ways until the ripening time one project gutenberg https what is here contracted mine is but servant s part i have spoken to ilderim what sayest thou looked at the sheik it is he says son of hur the arab responded i have given my word and he is content with it but thou shalt have my oath binding and the ready hands of my tribe and whatever serviceable thing i the ilderim at ﬁxedly every man he answered at ﬁrst sadly has cup of pleasure poured him and soon or late it comes to his hand and he tastes and man but i see simonides and thou generous sheik see whither the proposal tends if i accept and enter upon the course farewell peace and the hopes which cluster around it the doors i might enter and the gates of quiet life will shut behind never to open again rome keeps them all and her outlawry will follow and her hunters and in the tombs near cities and the dismal caverns of remotest hills i must eat my crust and take my the speech was broken by sob all turned to esther who hid her face upon her father s shoulder i did not think of you esther said simonides gently he was himself deeply moved it is well enough simonides said man bears hard doom better knowing there is pity him let go they gave him ear again i was about to say he continued i have choice but take the part you assign and remaining here is to meet an ignoble death i will to the work at shall we have writings asked simonides moved by his habit of business i rest upon your word said and i ilderim answered thus simply was effected the treaty which was to alter hur s life and almost immediately the latter added it is done may the god of abraham help us simonides exclaimed one word now my friends said more cheerfully by your leave i will be my own until after the games it is not probable messala will set peril on foot until he has given the procurator time to answer him and that can not be in less than seven days from the despatch of his letter the meeting him in the circus is pleasure i would buy at whatever ilderim well pleased assented readily and simonides intent on business added it is well look you my master the delay will give time to you good part i understood you to speak of an inheritance derived from arrius is it in property villa near misenum and houses in i suggest then the sale of the property and safe deposit of the proceeds give an account of it and i will have authorities drawn and despatch an agent on the mission forthwith we will forestall the imperial robbers at least this you shall have the account project gutenberg https then if there be nothing more the work of the night is done said simonides ilderim combed his beard complacently saying and well the bread and wine again esther sheik ilderim will make us happy by staying with us till or at his pleasure and thou my let the horses be brought said i will return to the orchard the enemy will not discover if i go now and glanced at the four will be glad to see the day dawned he and malluch dismounted at the door of the project gutenberg https ix next night about the fourth hour stood on the terrace of the great warehouse with esther below them on the landing there was much running about and shifting of packages and boxes and shouting of men whose ﬁgures stooping heaving hauling looked in the light of the crackling torches kindled in their aid like the laboring genii of the fantastic eastern tales galley was being laden instant departure simonides had not yet come from his ofﬁce in which at the last moment he would deliver to the captain of the vessel instructions to proceed without stop to ostia the seaport of rome and after landing passenger there continue more leisurely to valentia on the coast of spain the passenger is the agent going to dispose of the estate derived from arrius the duumvir when the lines of the vessel are cast off and she is put about and her voyage begun will be committed irrevocably to the work undertaken the night before if he is disposed to repent the agreement with ilderim little time is allowed him to give notice and break it off he is master and has only to say the word such may have been the thought at the moment in his mind he was standing with folded arms looking upon the scene in the manner of man debating with himself young handsome rich but recently from the patrician circles of roman society it is easy to think of the world besetting him with appeals not to give more to onerous duty or ambition attended with outlawry and danger we can even imagine the arguments with which he was pressed the hopelessness of contention with cæsar the uncertainty veiling everything connected with the king and his coming the ease honors state purchasable like goods in market and strongest of all the sense newly acquired of home with friends to make it delightful only those who have been wanderers long desolate can know the power there was in the latter appeal let us add now the cunning enough of itself always whispering to the weak stay take thine ease always presenting the sunny side of world was in this instance helped by s companion were you ever at rome he asked esther replied would you like to go i think why i am afraid of rome she answered with perceptible tremor of the voice he looked at her rather down upon her at his side she appeared little more than child in the dim light he could not see her face distinctly even the form was shadowy but again he was reminded of tirzah and sudden tenderness fell upon just so the lost sister stood with him on the the calamitous morning of the accident to gratus poor tirzah where was she now esther had the beneﬁt of the feeling evoked if project gutenberg https sister he could never look upon her his servant and that she was his servant in fact would make him always the more considerate and gentle towards her i can not think of rome she continued recovering her voice and speaking in her quiet womanly i can not think of rome city of palaces and temples and crowded with people she is to monster which has possession of one of the beautiful lands and lies there luring men to ruin and monster which it is not possible to ravenous beast gorging with blood she faltered looked down stopped go on said reassuringly she drew closer to him looked up again and said why must you make her your enemy why not rather make peace with her and be at rest you have had many ills and borne them you have survived the snares laid you by foes sorrow has consumed your youth is it well to give it the remainder of your days the girlish face under his eyes seemed to come nearer and get whiter the pleading went on he stooped towards it and asked softly what would you have esther she hesitated moment then asked in return is the property near rome residence and pretty it is palace in the midst of gardens and strewn walks fountains without and within statuary in the shady nooks hills around covered with vines and so high that neapolis and vesuvius are in sight and the sea an expanse of purpling blue dotted with restless sails cæsar has but in rome they say the old arrian villa is the and the life there is it quiet there was never summer day never moonlit night more quiet save when visitors come now that the old owner is gone and i am here there is nothing to break its unless it be the whispering of servants or the whistling of happy birds or the noise of fountains at play it is changeless except day by day old ﬂowers fade and fall and new ones bud and bloom and the sunlight gives place to the shado w of passing cloud the life esther was all too quiet it made restless by keeping always present feeling that i who have so much to was dropping into idle habits and tying myself with silken chains and after not long while end with nothing she looked of f over the river why did you ask he said good my that call if you will i am not your master and will not be call brother he could not see the ﬂush of pleasure which reddened her face and the glow of the eyes that went out lost in the void above the river i can not understand she said the nature which prefers the life you are going life project gutenberg https of violence and it may be of blood he said completing the sentence yes she added the nature which could prefer that life to such might be in the beautiful esther you mistake there is preference alas the roman is not so kind i am going of necessity to stay here is to die and if i go there the end will be the poisoned cup bravo s blow or judge s sentence obtained by perjury messala and the procurator gratus are rich with plunder of my father s estate and it is more important to them to keep their gains now than was their getting in the ﬁrst instance peaceable settlement is out of reach because of the confession it would imply and ah esther if i could buy them i not know that i would i not believe peace possible to not even in the sleepy shade and sweet air of the marble porches of the old matter who might be there to help bear the burden of the days nor by what patience of love she made the effort peace is not possible to while my people are lost i must be watchful to ﬁnd them if i ﬁnd them and they have suffered wrong shall not the guilty suffer it if they are dead by violence shall the murderers escape oh i could not sleep dreams nor could the holiest love by any stratagem lull to rest which conscience would not is it so bad then she asked her voice tremulous with feeling can nothing nothing be done took her hand you care so much yes she answered simply the hand was warm and in the palm of his it was lost he felt it tremble then the egyptian came so the opposite of this little one so tall so audacious with ﬂattery so cunning wit so ready beauty so wonderful manner so bewitching he carried the hand to his lips and gave it back you shall be another tirzah to esther who is tirzah the little sister the roman stole from and whom i must ﬁnd before i can rest or be happy just then gleam of light ﬂashed athwart the terrace and fell upon the two and looking round they saw servant roll simonides in his chair out of the door they went to the merchant and in the after he was principal immediately the lines of the galley were cast off and she swung round and midst the ﬂashing of torches and the shouting of joyous sailors hurried off to the committed to the cause of the king who was to project gutenberg https x the day before the games in the afternoon all ilderim s racing property was taken to the city and put in quarters adjoining the circus along with it the good man carried great deal of property not of that class so with servants retainers mounted and armed horses in leading cattle driven camels laden with baggage his outgoing from the orchard was not unlike tribal migration the people along the road failed not to laugh at his motley procession on the other side it was observed that with all his irascibility he was not in the least offended by their rudeness if he was under surveillance he had reason to believe the informer would describe the show with which he came up to the races the romans would laugh the city would be amused but what cared he next morning the pageant would be far on the road to the desert and going with it would be every movable thing of value belonging to the save such were essential to the success of his four he was in fact started home his tents were all folded the dowar was more in twelve hours all would be out of reach pursue who might man is never safer than when he is under the laugh and the shrewd old arab knew it neither he nor overestimated the inﬂuence of messala it was their opinion however that he would not begin active measures against them until after the meeting in the circus if defeated there especially if defeated by they might instantly look the worst he could he might not even wait advices from gratus with this view they shaped their course and were prepared to betake themselves out of harm s way they rode together now in good spirits calmly conﬁdent of success on the morrow on the way they came upon malluch in waiting them the faithful fellow gave sign by which it was possible to infer any knowledge on his part of the relationship so recently admitted between and simonides or of the treaty between them and ilderim he exchanged salutations usual and produced paper saying to the sheik i have here the notice of the editor of the games just issued in which you will ﬁnd your horses published the race you will ﬁnd in it also the order of exercises without waiting good sheik i congratulate you upon your victory he gave the paper over and leaving the worthy to master it turned to to you also son of arrius my congratulations there is nothing now to prevent your meeting messala every condition

divide the galleries with the the not the tribunal over the porta the scarlet and gold will rule there but if we win malluch chuckled with the pleasure of the if we win how the dignitaries will tremble they will bet of course according to their scorn of everything not three ﬁve to one on messala because he is dropping his voice yet lower he added it ill becomes jew of good standing in the temple to put his money at such hazard yet in conﬁdence i will have friend next behind the consul s seat to accept offers of three to one or ﬁve or madness may go to such height i have put to his order six thousand shekels the nay malluch said roman will wager only in his roman coin suppose you ﬁnd your friend and place to his order sestertii in such amount you choose and look you him be instructed to seek wagers with messala and his supporters ilderim s four against messala malluch reﬂected moment the ef fect will be to centre interest upon your the very thing i seek i see i ay malluch would you serve perfectly help to ﬁx the public eye upon our s and malluch spoke it can be then let it be done said enormous wagers offered will answer if the offers are accepted all the better malluch turned his eyes watchfully upon shall i not have back the equivalent of his robbery said hur partly to himself another opportu nity may not come and if i could break him in fortune well in pride our father jacob could take of look of determined will knit his handsome face giving emphasis to his further speech yes it shall be hark malluch stop not in thy offer of sestertii advance them to talents if any there be who dare so high five ten twenty talents ay ﬁfty so the wager be with messala it is mighty sum said malluch i must have security so thou shalt go to simonides and tell him i wish the matter arranged tell him my heart is set on the ruin of my enemy and that the opportunity hath such excellent promise that i choose such hazards on our side be the god of our fathers go good malluch let this not and malluch greatly delighted gave him parting salutation and started to ride away but returned presently your pardon he said to there was another matter i could not get near

turns there watch well if i have favor at all i nay malluch let it go unsaid only get thee there and watch at that moment cry burst from ilderim ha by the splendor of god what is this he drew near with ﬁnger pointing on the face of the notice read said better took the paper which signe d by the prefect of the province editor performed the ofﬁce of modern programme giving particularly the several divertisements provided the occasion it informed the public that there would be ﬁrst procession of extraordinary splendor that the procession would be succeeded by the customary honors to the god consus whereupon the games would begin running leaping wrestling boxing each in the order stated the names of the competitors were given with their several nationalities and schools of training the trials in which they had been engaged the prizes won and the prizes now offered under the latter head the sums of money were stated in illuminated letters telling of the departure of the day when the simple chaplet of pine or laurel was fully enough the victor hungering glory something better than riches and content with it over these parts of the programme sped with rapid eyes at last he came to the announcement of the race he read it slowly attending lovers of the heroic sports were assured they would certainly be gratiﬁed by an orestean struggle unparalleled in antioch the city offered the spectacle in honor of the consul one hundred thousand sestertii and crown of laurel were the prizes then followed the particulars the entries were six in only permitted and to further interes t in

gutenberg https xi evening was hardly come upon antioch when the omphalus nearly in the centre of the city became troubled fountain from which in every direction but chieﬂy down to the nymphaeum and east and west along the colonnade of herod ﬂowed currents of people the time given up to bacchus and apollo such indulgence anything more ﬁtting can not be imagined than the great roofed streets which were literally miles on miles of porticos wrought of marble polished to the last degree of ﬁnish and all gifts to the voluptuous city by princes careless of expenditure where in this instance they thought they were eternizing themselves darkness was not permitted anywhere and the singing the laughter the shouting were incessant and in compound like the roar of waters dashing through hollow grots confused by multitude of echoes the many nationalities represented though they might have amazed stranger were not peculiar to antioch of the various missions of the great empire one seems to have been the fusion of men and the introduction of strangers to each other accordingly whole peoples rose up and went at pleas ure taking with them their costumes customs speech and gods and where they chose they stopped engaged in business built hous es erected altars and were what they had been at home there was peculiarity however which could not have failed the notice of looker this night in antioch nearly everybody wore the colors of one or other of the charioteers announced the morrow s race sometimes it was in form of scarf sometimes badge often ribbon or feather whatever the form it signiﬁed merely the wearer s partiality thus green published friend of cleanthes the athenian and black an adherent of the byzantine this was according to custom old probably the day of the race of custom by the way worthy of study marvel of history illustrative of the absurd yet appalling extremities to which men frequently suf fer their follies to drag them the observer abroad on this occasion once attracted to the wearing of colors would have very shortly decided that there were three in white and the mixed scarlet and gold but let us from the streets to the palace on the island the ﬁve great chandeliers in the saloon are freshly lighted the assemblage is much the same that already noticed in connection with the place the divan has its corps of sleepers and burden of garments and the tables yet resound with the rattle and clash of dice yet the greater part of the company are not doing anything they walk about or yawn tremendously or pause they pass each other to exchange idle nothings will the weather be fair morrow are the preparations the games complete the laws of the circus in antioch differ from the laws of the circus in rome truth is the young fellows are suffering from ennui their heavy work is done that is we would ﬁnd their tablets could we look at them covered with memoranda of project gutenberg https contest on the running the wrestling the boxing on everything but the and why not on that good reader they can not ﬁnd anybody who will hazard so much denarius with them against messala there are colors in the saloon but his one thinks of his defeat why they say is he not perfect in his training did he not graduate from an imperial lanista were not his horses winners at the circensian in the circus maximus and yes he is roman in corner at ease on the divan messala himself may be seen around him sitting or standing are his courtierly admirers plying him with questions there is of course but one topic enter drusus and cecilius ah cries the young prince throwing himself on the divan at messala s feet ah by bacchus i am tired whither away asks messala up the street up to the omphalus and shall say how far rivers of people never so many in the city before they say we will see the whole world at the circus messala laughed scornfully the idiots perpol they never beheld circensian with cæsar editor but my drusus what found you you get said cecilius what asked drusus the procession of mirabile cried drusus half rising we met faction of whites and they had banner ha ha he fell back indolently cruel to go on said messala scum of the desert were they my messala and from the jacob s temple in jerusalem what had i to with them nay said cecilius drusus is afraid of laugh but i am not my speak thou well we stopped the faction offered them wager said drusus relenting and taking the word from the shadow s mouth ha ha fellow with not enough skin on his face to make worm carp stepped forth ha ha yes i drew my tablets who is your man i asked the jew said he then i what shall it be how much he answered excuse messala by jove s thunder i can not go on laughter ha ha ha the listeners leaned forward messala looked to cecilius shekel said the latter shekel shekel project gutenberg https burst of scornful laughter ran fast upon the repetition and what did drusus asked messala an outcry over about the door just then occasioned rush to that quarter and the noise there continued and grew louder even cecilius betook himself off pausing only to say the noble drusus my messala put up his tablets the white white let him come this way this way these and like exclamations ﬁlled the saloon to the stoppage of other speech the quit their games the sleepers awoke rubbed their eyes drew their tablets and hurried to the common centre i offer and the person so warmly received was the respectable jew hur s from cyprus he entered grave quiet observant his robe was spotlessly white so was the cloth of his turban bowing and smiling at the welcome he moved slowly towards the central table arrived there he drew his robe about him in stately manner took seat and waved his hand the gleam of jewel on ﬁnger helped him not little to the silence which ensued noble salute you he said easy by jupiter who is he asked drusus dog of by the army residence rome vastly rich grown so contractor of furnishments which he never furnishes he spins mischiefs nevertheless ﬁner than spiders spin their webs the girdle of venus let us catch him messala arose he spoke and with drusus joined the mass crowded about the purveyor it came to on the street said that person producing his tablets and opening them on the table with an impressive air of business that there was great discomfort in the palace because offers on messala were going without takers the gods you know must have sacriﬁces and here am you see my color let us to the matter odds ﬁrst amounts next what will you give the audacity seemed to stun his hearers haste he said i have an engagement with the the spur was ef fective two to one cried half dozen in voice what exclaimed the purveyor astonished only two to one and yours roman take three three say mine but dog of jew give four four it is said boy stung by the taunt ﬁve cried the purveyor instantly profound stillness fell upon the assemblage the master and waiting project gutenberg https inaction became awkward to the many give the honor of rome five let it be said one in answer there was sharp commotio messala himself appeared five let it be he said and sanballat smiled and made ready to write if cæsar die he said rome will not be all bereft there is at least one other with spirit to take his place give six be it answered messala there was another shout louder than the ﬁrst six be it repeated messala six to difference between roman and jew and having found it now redemptor of the ﬂesh of swine let us on the quickly the consul may send thee and i will then be sanballat took the laugh against him coolly and wrote and offered the writing to messala read read everybody demanded and messala read messala of rome in wager with sanballat also of rome says he will beat the jew amount of wager twenty talents odds to sanballat six to one witnesses sanballa there was noise motion each person seemed held in the pose the reading found him messala stared at the memorandum while the eyes which had him in view opened wide and stared at him he felt the gaze and thought rapid ly so lately he stood in the same place and in the same way hector ed the countrymen around him they would remember it if he refused to sign his was lost and sign he could not he was not worth one hundred talents nor the ﬁfth part of the sum suddenly his mind became blank he stood speechless the color ﬂed his face an idea at last came to his relief thou jew he said where hast thou twenty talents show sanballat s provoking smile deepened there he replied of fering messala paper read read arose all around again messala read at antioch tammuz 16th day the bearer sanballat of rome hath now to his order with ﬁfty talents coin of cæsar fifty talents ﬁfty talents echoed the throng in amazement then drusus came to the rescue by hercules he shouted the paper lies and the jew is liar who but cæsar hath ﬁfty talents at order down with the insolent white the cry was angry and it was angrily repeated yet sanballat kept his seat and his smile grew more exasperating the longer he waited at length messala project gutenberg https hush one to one my to one love of our ancient roman the timely action recovered him his ascendancy thou circumcised dog he continue d to sanballat i gave thee six to one did i not yes said the jew quietly well give now the ﬁxing of the with reserve if the amount be triﬂing have thy will answered sanballat write then ﬁve in place of twenty hast thou so much by the mother of the gods i will show you nay the word of so brave roman must pass only make the sum make it and i will write it and forthwith they exchanged writings sanballat immediately arose and looked around him sneer in place of his smile man better than he knew those with whom he was dealing romans he said another wager if you dare five talents against ﬁve talents that the white will win i challenge you collectively they were again surprised what he cried louder shall it be said in the circus morrow that dog of israel went into the saloon of the palace full of roman them the scion of laid ﬁve talents before them in challenge and they had not the courage to take it up the sting was unendurable have done insolent said drusus write the challenge and leave it on the table and if we ﬁnd thou hast indeed so much money to put at such hopeless hazard i drusus promise it shall be sanballat wrote again and rising said unmoved ever see drusus i leave the offer with you whe n it is signed send it to any time before the race begins i will be found with the consul in seat over the porta pompae peace to you peace to he bowed and departed careless of the shout of derision with which they pursued him out of the door in the night the story of the prodigious wager ﬂew along the streets and over the city and lying with his four was told of it and also that messala s whole fortune was on the hazard and he slept never so soundly project gutenberg https xii the circus at antioch stood on the south bank of the river nearly opposite the island differing in respect from the plan of such buildings in general in the purest sense the games were gift to the public consequently everybody was free to attend and vast the holding capacity of the structure was so fearful were the people on this occasion lest there should not be room them that early the day before the opening of the exhib ition they took up all the vacant spaces in the vicinity where their temporary shelter suggested an army in waiting at midnight the entrances were thrown wide and the rabble surging in occupied the quarters assigned to them from which nothing less than an earthquake or an army with spears could have dislodged them they dozed the night away on the benches and breakfasted there and there the close of the exercises found them patient and in the beginning the better people their seats secured began moving towards the circus about the ﬁrst hour of the mornin g the noble and very rich among them distinguished by litters and retinues of liveried servants by the second hour the efﬂux from the city was stream unbroken and innumerable exactly the gnomon of the ofﬁcial dial up in the citadel pointed the second hour half gone the legion in full panoply and with all its standards on exhibit descended from mount sulpius and when the rear of the last cohort disappeared in the bridge antioch was literally that the circus could hold the multitude but that the multitude was gone out to it nevertheless great concourse on the river shore witnessed the consul come over from the island in barge of state the great man landed and was received by the legion the martial show one brief moment transcended the attraction of the circus at the third hour the audience if such it may be termed was assembled at last ﬂourish of trumpets called silence and instantly the gaze of over hundred thousand persons was directed towards pile forming the eastern section of the building there was basement ﬁrst broken in the middle by broad arched passage called the porta pompae over which on an elevated tribunal magniﬁcently deco rated with insignia and legionary standards the consul sat in the place of honor on both sides of the passage the basement was divided into stalls termed carceres each protected in front by massive gates swung to statuesque pilasters over the stalls next was cornice crowned by low balustrade back of which the seats arose in theatre arrangement all occupied by throng of dignitaries superbly attired the pile extended the width of the circus and was ﬂanked on both sides by towers which besides helping the architects give grace to their work served the velaria or purple awnings project gutenberg https them so to throw the whole quarter in shade that became exceedingly grateful the day advanced this structure it is now thought can be made useful in helping the reader to sufﬁcient understanding of the arrangement of the rest of the interior of the circus he has only to fancy himself seated on the tribunal with the consul facing to the west where everything is under his eye on the right and left if he will look he will see the main entrances very ample and guarded by gates hinged to the towers directly below him is the level plane of considerable extent covered with ﬁne white sand there all the trials will take place except the running looking across this sanded arena westwardly still there is pedestal of marble supporting three low conical pillars of gray stone much carven many an eye will hunt those pillars before the day is done they are the ﬁrst goal and mark the beginning and end of the behind the pedestal leaving way and space an altar commences wall ten or twelve feet in breadth and ﬁve or six in height extending thence exactly two hundred yards or one olympic stadium at the farther or westward extremity of the wall there is another pedestal surmounted with pillars which mark the second goal the racers will enter the course on the right of the ﬁrst goal and keep the wall all the time to their left the beginning and ending points of the contest lie consequently directly in front of the consul across the arena and that reason his seat was admittedly the most desirable in the circus now if the reader who is still suppos ed to be seated on the consular tribunal over the porta pompae will look up from the ground arrangement of the interior the ﬁrst point to attract his notice will be the marking of the outer of the course is solid wall ﬁfteen or twenty feet in height with balustrade on its cope like that over the carceres or stalls in the east this balcony if followed round the course will be found broken in three places to allow passages of exit and entrance two in the north and one in the west the latter very ornate and called the gate of triumph because when all is over the victors will pass out that way crowned and with triumphal escort and ceremonies at the west end the balcony encloses the course in the form of half circle and is made to uphold two great galleries directly behind the balustrade on the coping of the balcony is the ﬁrst seat from which ascend the succeeding benches each higher than the one in front of it giving to view spectacle of surpassing spectacle of vast space ruddy and glistening with human faces and rich with varicolored costumes the commonalty occupy quarters over in the west beginning at the point of termination of an awning stretched it would seem the accommodation of the better classes exclusively having thus the whole interior of the circus under view at the moment of the sounding of the trumpets let the reader next imagine the multitude seated and sunk to sudden silence and motionless in its intensity of interest out of the porta pompae over in the east rises sound mixed of voices and instruments harmonized presently forth issues project gutenberg https of the procession with which the celebration begins the editor and civic authorities of the city givers of the games follow in robes and garlands then the gods some on platforms borne by men others in great carria ges gorgeously decorated next them again the contestants of the day each in costume exactly he will run wrestle leap box or drive slowly crossing the arena the procession proceeds to make circuit of the course the display is beautiful and imposing approval runs before it in shout the water rises and swells in front of boat in motion if the dumb ﬁgured gods make sign of appreciation of the welcome the editor and his associates are not so backward the reception of the athletes is even more demonstrative there is not man in the assemblage who has not something in wager upon them though but mite or farthing and it is noticeable the classes move by that the favorites among them are speedily singled out either their names are loudest in the uproar or they are more profusely showered with wreaths and garlands tossed to them from the balcony if there is question to the popularity with the public of the several games it is now put to rest to the splendor of the chariots and the superexcellent beauty of the horses the charioteers add the personality necessary to perfect the charm of their display their tunics short sleeveless and of the ﬁnest woollen texture are of the assigned colors horseman accompanies each one of them except who some chosen to go alone so too they are all helmeted but him they approach the spectators stand upon the benches and there is sensible deepening of the clamor in which sharp listener may detect the shrill piping of women and children at the same time the things roseate ﬂying from the balcony thicken into storm and striking the men drop into the which are threatened with ﬁlling to the tops even the horses have share in the ovation nor may it be said they are less conscious than their masters of the honors they receive very soon with the other contestants it is made apparent that some of the drivers are more in favor than others and then the discovery follows that nearly every individual on the benches women and children well men wears color most frequently ribbon upon the breast or in the hair now it is green now yellow now blue but searching the great body carefully it is manifest that there is preponderance of white and scarlet and gold in modern assemblage called together this one is particularly where there are sums at hazard upon the race preference would be decided by the qualities or performance of the horses here however nationality was the rule if the byzantine and sidonian found small support it was because their cities were scarcely represented on the benches on their side the greeks though very numerous were divided between the corinthian and the athenian leaving but scant showing of green and yellow messala s scarlet and gold would have been but little better had not the citizens of antioch proverbially race of courtiers joined the romans by adopting the color of their favorite there were left then the country people or syrians the jews and the arabs and they from faith in the blood of the sheik s four blent largely with hate of the romans whom they desired above all things to project gutenberg https and humbled mounted the white making the most noisy and probably the most numerous faction of all the charioteers move on in the circuit the excitement increases at the second goal where especially in the galleries the white is the ruling color the people exhaust their ﬂowers and rive the air with screams messala messala such are the cries upon the passage of the procession the factionists take their seats and resume conversation ah by bacchus was he not handsome exclaims woman whose romanism is betrayed by the colors ﬂying in her hair and how splendid his chariot replies neighbor of the same proclivities it is all ivory and gold jupiter grant he wins the notes on the bench behind them were entirely dif ferent hundred shekels on the jew the voice is high and shrill nay be thou not rash whispers moderating friend to the speaker the children of jacob are not much given to gentile sports which are too often accursed in the sight of the true but saw you ever one more cool and assured and what an arm he has and what horses says third and that fourth one adds they say he has all the tricks of the woman completes the eulogium yes and he is even handsomer than the thus encouraged the enthusiast shrieks again hundred shekels on the jew thou fool answers an antiochian from bench well forward on the balcony knowest thou not there are ﬁfty talents laid against him six to one on messala put up thy shekels lest abraham rise and smite ha ha thou ass of antioch cease thy bray knowest thou not it was messala betting on himself such the reply and so ran the controversy not always when at length the march was ended and the porta pompae received back the procession knew he had his prayer the eyes of the east were upon his contest with project gutenberg https xiii about three clock speaking in moder n style the program was concluded except the the editor wisely considerate of the comfort of the people chose that time recess at once the vomitoria were thrown open and all who could hastened to the portico outside where the restaurateurs had their quarters those who remained yawned talked gossiped consulted their tablets and all distinctions else forgotten merged into but two the winners who were happy and the losers who were grum and captious now however third class of spectators composed of citizens who desired only to witness the availed themselves of the recess to come in and take their reserved seats by so doing they thought to attract the least attention and give the least offence among these were simonides and his party whose places were in the vicinity of the main entrance on the north side opposite the consul the four stout servants carried the merchant in his chair up the aisle curiosity was much excited presently some one called his name those about caught it and passed it on along the benches to the west and there was hurried climbing on seats to get sight of the man about whom common report had coined and put in circulation romance so mixed of good fortune and bad that the like had never been known or heard of before ilderim was also recognized and warmly greeted but nobody knew balthasar or the two women who followed him closely veiled the people made way the party respectfully and the ushers seated them in easy speaking distance of each other down by the balustrade overlooking the arena in providence of comfort they sat upon cushions and had stools footrests the women were iras and esther upon being seated the latter cast frightened look over the circus and drew the veil closer about her face while the egyptian letting her veil fall upon her shoulders gave herself to view and gazed at the scene with the seeming unconsciousness of being stared at which in woman is usually the result of long social habitude the generally were yet making their ﬁrst examination of the great spectacle beginning with the consul and his attendants when some workmen ran in and commenced to stretch chalked rope across the arena from balcony to balcony in front of the pillars of the ﬁrst goal about the same time also six men came in through the porta pompae and took post one in front of each occupied stall whereat there was prolonged hum of voices in every quarter see see the green goes to number four on the right the athenian is and he is in number project gutenberg https the watch the white see he crosses over he stops number one it one on the the black stops there and the white at number so it these it should be understood were dressed in tunics colored like those of the competing charioteers so when they took their stations everybody knew the particular stall in which his favorite was that moment waiting did you ever see messala the egyptian asked esther the jewess shuddered she answered if not her father s enemy the roman was s he is beautiful iras spoke her large eyes brightened and she shook her jeweled fan esther looked at her with the thought is he then so much handsomer than next moment she heard ilderim say to her father yes his stall is number two on the left of the porta pompae and thinking it was of he spoke her eyes turned that way taking but the briefest glance at the wattled face of the gate she drew the veil close and muttered little prayer presently sanballat came to the party i am just from the stalls sheik he said bowing gravely to ilderim who began combing his beard while his eyes glittered with eager inquiry the horses are in perfect ilderim replied simply if they are beaten i pray it be by some other than turning then to simonides sanballat drew out tablet saying i bring you also something of interest i reported you will remember the wager concluded with messala last night and stated that i left another which if taken was to be delivered to in writing before the race began here it simonides took the tablet and read the memorandum carefully yes he said their emissary came to ask if you had so much money with keep the tablet close if you lose you know where to come if you win face knit if you friend see to it see the signers escape not hold them to the last shekel that is what they would with trust replied the purveyor will you not sit with us asked simonides you are very good the other returned but if i leave the consul young rome yonder will boil over peace to you peace to at length the recess came to an end the trumpeters blew call at which the absentees rushed back to their places at the same time some attendants appeared in the arena and climbing upon the division wall went to an entablature near the second goal at the west end and placed upon it seven wooden balls then returning to the ﬁrst goal upon an entablature there they set up seven other pieces of wood hewn to represent dolphins what shall they with the balls and ﬁshes sheik asked balthasar hast thou never attended race project gutenberg https never before and hardly know i why i am well they are to keep the count at the end of each round run thou shalt see one ball and one ﬁsh taken the preparations were now complete and presently trumpeter in gaudy uniform arose by the editor ready to blow the signal of commencement promptly at his order straightway the stir of the people and the hum of their conversation died away every face and every face in the lessening perspective turned to the east all eyes settled upon the gates of the six stalls which shut in the competitors the unusual ﬂush upon his face gave proof that even simonides had caught the universal excitement ilderim pulled his beard fast and furious look now the roman said the fair egyptian to esther who did not hear her with wn veil and beating heart she sat watching the structure containing the stalls it should be observed was in form of the segment of circle retire d on the right so that its central point was projected forward and midway the course on the starting side of the ﬁrst goal every stall consequently was equally distant from the or chalked rope above mentioned the trumpet sounded short and sharp whereupon the starters one each chariot leaped down from behind the pillars of the goal ready to give assistance if any of the fours proved unmanageable again the trumpet blew and simultan eously the threw the stalls open first appeared the mounted attendants of the charioteers ﬁve in all having rejected the service the chalked line was lowered to let them pass then raised again they were beautifully mounted yet scarcely observed they rode forward all the time the trampling of eager horses and the voices of drivers scarcely less eager were heard behind in the stalls so that one might not look away an instant from the gaping doors the chalked line up again the called their men instantly the ushers on the balcony waved their hands and shouted with all their strength down down well have whistled to stay storm forth from each stall like missiles in volley from so many great guns rushed the six fours and up the vast assemblage arose electriﬁed and irrepressible and leaping upon the benches ﬁlled the circus and the air above it with yells and screams this was the time which they had so patiently waited the moment of supreme interest treasured up in talk and dreams since the proclamation of the games he is cried iras pointing to messala i see him answered esther looking at the veil was withdrawn an instant the little jewess was brave an idea of the joy there is in doing an heroic deed under the eyes of multitude came to her and she understood ever after how at such times the souls of men in the frenzy of performance laugh at death or get it utterly the competitors were now under view from nearly every part of the circus yet the race was not begun they had ﬁrst to make project gutenberg https line successfully the line was stretched the purpose of equalizing the start if it were dashed upon discomﬁture of man and horses might be apprehended on the other hand to approach it timidly was to incur the hazard of being thrown behind in the beginning of the race and that was certain forfeit of the great adva ntage always striven the position next the division wall on the inner line of the course this trial its perils and consequences the spectators knew thoroughly and if the opinion of old nestor uttered that time he handed the reins to his son were it is not strength but art obtained the prize and to be swift is less than to be wise all on the benches might well look warning of the winner to be now given justifying the interest with which they breathlessly watched the result the arena swam in dazzle of light yet each driver looked ﬁrst thing the rope then the coveted inner line so all six aiming at the same point and speeding furiously collision seemed inevitable nor that merely what if the editor at the last moment dissatisﬁed with the start should withhold the signal to drop the rope or if he should not give it in time the crossing was about two hundred and ﬁfty feet in width quick the eye steady the hand unerring the judgment required if now one look away or his mind wande r or rein slip and what attraction in the ensemble of the thousands over the spreading balcony calculating upon the natural impulse to give one glance sooth of curiosity or vanity malice might be there with an artiﬁce while friendship and love did they serve the same result might be deadly malice the divine last touch in perfecting the beautiful is animation can we accept the saying then these latter days so tame in pastime and dull in sports have scarcely anything to compare to the spectacle offered by the six contestants let the reader try to fancy it let him ﬁrst look down upon the arena and see it glistening in its frame of granite walls let him then in this perfect ﬁeld see the chariots light of wheel very graceful and ornate paint and burnishing can make s rich with ivory and gold let him see the drivers erect and statuesque undisturbed by the motion of the cars their limbs naked and fresh and ruddy with the healthful polish of the their right hands goads suggestive of torture dreadful to the their left hands held in careful separation and high that they may not interfere with view of the steeds the reins passing taut from the fore ends of the let him see the fours chosen beauty well speed let him see them in magniﬁcent action their masters not more conscious of the situation and all that is asked and hoped from heads tossing nostrils in play now distent now too dainty the sand which they touch but to slender yet with impact crushing muscle of the rounded bodies instinct with glorious life swelling diminishing justifying the world in taking from them its ultimate measure of force ﬁnally along with chariots drivers horses let the reader see the accompanying shadows ﬂy and with such distinctness the picture comes he may share the satisfaction and deeper pleasure of those to whom project gutenberg https thrilling fact not feeble fancy every age has its plenty of sorrows heaven help where there are pleasures the competitors having started each on the shortest line the position next the wall yielding would be like giving up the race and who dared yield it is not in common nature to change purpose in and the cries of encouragement from the balcony were indistinguishable and indescribable roar which had the same ef fect upon all the drivers the fours neared the rope together then the trumpeter by the editor s side blew signal vigorously twenty feet away it was not heard seeing the action however the judges dropped the rope and not an instant too soon the hoof of one of messala s horses struck it it fell nothing daunted the roman shook out his long lash loosed the reins leaned forward and with triumphant shout took the wall jove with us jove with us yelled all the roman faction in frenzy of delight messala turned in the bronze lion s head at the end of his axle caught the of the athenian s ﬂinging the brute over against its both staggered struggled and lost their headway the ushers had their will at least in part the thousands held their breath with horror only up where the consul sat was there shouting jove with us screamed drusus frantically he wins jove with us answered his associates seeing messala speed on tablet in hand sanballat turned to them crash from the course below stopped his speech and he could not but look that way messala having passed the corinthian was the only contestant on the athenian s right and to that side the latter tried to turn his broken four and then would have it the wheel of the byzantine who was next on the left struck the of his chariot knocking his feet from under him there was crash scream of rage and fear and the unfortunate cleanthes fell under the hoofs of his own steeds terrible sight against which esther covered her eyes on swept the corinthian on the byzantine on the sidonian sanballat looked and turned again to drusus and his coterie hundred sestertii on the jew he cried taken answered drusus another hundred on the jew shouted sanballat nobody appeared to hear him he called again the situation below was too absorbing and they were too busy shouting messala messala jove with us when the jewess ventured to look again party of workmen were removing the horses and broken car another party were taking off the man himself and every bench upon which there was greek was vocal with execrations and prayers vengeance suddenly she dropped her hands unhurt was to the front coursing freely forward along with the roman behind them in group followed the sidonian the corinthian and the project gutenberg https race was on the souls of the racers were in it over them bent the project gutenberg https xiv when the dash position began we have seen was on the extreme left of the six moment like the others he was half blinded by the light in the arena yet he managed to catch sight of his antagonists and divine their purpose at messala who was more than an antagonist to him he gave one searching look the air of passionless hauteur characteristic of the ﬁne patrician face was there of old and so was the italian beauty which the helmet rather increased but may have been jealous fancy or the effect of the brassy shadow in which the features were at the moment cast still the israelite thought he saw the soul of the man through glass darkly cruel cunning desperate not so excited soul in tension of watchfulness and ﬁerce resolve in time not longer than was required to turn to his four again felt his own resolution harden to like temper at whatever cost at all hazards he would humble this enemy prize friends wagers that can be thought of possible interest in the race was lost in the one deliberate purpose regard life even should not hold him back yet there was passion on his part blinding rush of heated blood from heart to brain and back again impulse to ﬂing himself upon fortune he did not believe in fortune far otherwise he had his plan and conﬁding in himself he settled to the task never more observant never more capable the air about him seemed aglow with renewed and perfect transparency when not across the arena he saw that messala s rush would if there was collision and the rope fell give him the wall that the rope would fall he ceased soon to doubt and further it came to him sudden insight that messala knew it was to be let drop at the last moment prearrangement with the editor could safely reach that point in the contest and it suggested what more than the ofﬁcial to lend himself to countryman who besides being so popular had also so much at stake there could be other accounting the conﬁdence with which messala pushed his four forward the instant his competitors were prudentially checking their fours in front of the other except madness it is one thing to see necessity and another to act upon it hur yielded the wall the time the rope fell and all the fours but his sprang into the course under urgency of voice and lash he drew head to the right and with all the speed of his arabs darted across the trails of his opponents the angle of movement being such to lose the least time and gain the greatest possible advance so while the spectators were shivering at the athenian s mishap and the sidonian byzantine and corinthian were striving with such skill they possessed to avoid involvement in the ruin swept around and took the course neck and neck with messala though on the outside the marvellous skill shown in making the change thus from the extreme left across to the right without appreciable project gutenberg https not fail the sharp eyes upon the benches the circus seemed to rock and rock again with prolonged applause then esther clasped her hands in glad surprise then sanballat smiling offered his hundred sestertii second time witho ut taker and then the romans began to doubt thinking messala might have found an equal if not master and that in an israelite and now racing together side by side narrow interval between them the two neared the second goal the pedestal of the three pillars there viewed from the west was stone wall in the form of around which the course and opposite balcony were bent in exact parallelism making this turn was considered in all respects the most telling test of charioteer it was in fact the very feat in which oraetes failed an involuntary admission of interest on the part of the spectators hush fell over all the circu s so that the ﬁrst time in the race the rattle and clang of the cars plunging after the tugging steeds were distinctly heard then it would seem messala observed and recognized him and at once the audacity of the man ﬂamed out in an astonishing manner down eros up mars he shouted whirling his lash with practised down eros up mars he repeated and caught the arabs of cut the like of which they had never known the blow was seen in every quarter and the amazement was universal the silence deepened up on the benches behind the consul the boldest held his breath waiting the outcome only moment thus then involuntarily down from the balcony thunder falls burst the indignant cry of the people the four sprang forward affrighted hand had ever been laid upon them except in love they had been nurtured ever so tenderly and they grew their conﬁdence in man became lesson to men beautiful to see what should such dainty natures under such indignity but leap from death forward they sprang with one impulse and forward leaped the car past question every experience is serviceable to us where got the large hand and mighty grip which helped him now so well where but from the oar with which so long he fought the sea and what was this spring of the ﬂoor under his feet to the dizzy eccentric lurch with which in the old time the trembling ship yielded to the beat of staggering billows drunk with their power so he kept his place and gave the four free rein and called to them in soothing voice trying merely to guide them round the dangerous turn and before the fever of the people began to abate he had back the mastery nor that only on approaching the ﬁrst goal he was again side by side with messala bearing with him the sympathy and admiration of every one not roman so clearly was the feeling shown so vigorous its manifestation that messala with all his boldness felt it unsafe to triﬂe further the cars whirled round the goal esther caught sight of hur s little pale little higher raised otherwise calm even placid immediately man climbed on the entablature at the west end of the division wall and took down one of the conical wooden balls dolphin on the east entablature was taken down at the same time in like manner the second ball and second dolphin disappeared and then the third ball and third project gutenberg https rounds concluded still messala held the inside position still moved with him side by side still the other competitors followed before the contest began to have the appearance of one of the double races which became so popular in rome during the later cæsarean and in the ﬁrst the corinthian sidonian and byzantine in the second meantime the ushers succeeded in returning the multitude to their seats though the clamor continued to run the rounds keeping it were even pace with the rivals in the course below in the ﬁfth round the sidonian succeeded in getting place outside but lost it directly the sixth round was entered upon without change of relative position gradually the speed had been the blood of the competitors warmed with the work men and beasts seemed to know alike that the ﬁnal crisis was near bringing the time the winner to assert himself the interest which from the beginning had centred chieﬂy in the struggle between the roman and the jew with an intense and general sympathy the latter was fast changing to anxiety on his account on all the benches the spectators bent forward motionless except their faces turned following the contestants ilderim quitted combing his beard and esther got her fears hundred sestertii on the jew cried sanballat to the romans under the consul s awning there was reply ﬁve talents or ten choose ye he shook his tablets at them deﬁantly i will take thy sestertii answered roman youth preparing to write not so interposed friend why messala hath reached his utmost speed see him lean over his chariot rim the reins loose ﬂying ribbons look then at the the ﬁrst one looked by hercules he replied his countenance falling the dog throws all his weight on the bits i see i see if the gods help not our friend he will be run away with by the israelite not yet look jove with us jove with us the cry swelled by every latin tongue shook the velaria over the consul s head if it were true that messala had attaine d his utmost speed the effort was with effect slowly but certainly he was beginning to forge ahead his horses were running with their heads low down from the balcony their bodies appeared actually to skim the earth their nostrils showed blood red in expansion their eyes seemed straining in their sockets certainly the good steeds were doing their best how long could they keep the pace it was but the commencement of the sixth round on they dashed they neared the second goal turned in behind the roman s car the joy of the messala faction reached its bound they screamed and howled and tossed their colors and sanballat ﬁlled his tablets with wagers of their project gutenberg https in the lower gallery over the gate of triumph found it hard to keep his cheer he had cherished the vague hint dropped to him by of something to happen in the turning of the western pillars it was the ﬁfth round yet the something had not come and he had said to himself the sixth will bring it but lo was hardly holding place at the tail of his enemy s car over in the east end simonides party held their peace the merchant s head was bent low ilderim tugged at his beard and dropped his brows till there was nothing of his eyes but an occasional sparkle of light esther scarcely breathed iras alone appeared glad along the messala leading next him and so close it was the old story first ﬂew eumelus on pheretian steeds with those of tros bold diomed succeeds close on eumelus back they puff the wind and seem just mounting on his car behind full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze and hovering er their stretching shadow thus to the ﬁrst goal and round it messala fearful of losing his place hugged the stony wall with perilous clasp foot to the left and he had been dashed to pieces yet when the turn was ﬁnished man looking at the of the two cars could have said here went messala there the jew they left but one trace behind them they whirled by esther saw s face again and it was whiter than before simonides shrewder than esther said to ilderim the moment the rivals turned into the course i am judge good sheik if be not about to execute some design his face hath that to which ilderim answered saw you how clean they were and fresh by the splendor of god friend they have not been running but now watch one ball and one dolphin remained on the entablatures and all the people drew long breath the beginning of the end was at hand first the sidonian gave the scour ge to his four and smarting with fear and pain they dashed desperately forward promising brief time to go to the front the effort ended in promise next the byzantine and the corinthian each made the trial with like result after which they were practically out of the race thereupon with readiness perfectly explicable all the factions except the romans joined hope in and openly indulged their feeling they shouted and the blent voices of the many rolled overwhelmingly against the consular stand from the benches above him he passed the favor descended in ﬁerce injunctions speed thee jew take the wall now on loose the arabs give them rein and scour ge let him not have the turn on thee again now or never project gutenberg https the balustrade they stooped low stretching their hands imploringly to him either he did not hear or could not better halfway round the course and he was still following at the second goal even still change and now to make the turn messala began to draw in his hand steeds an act which necessarily slackened their speed his spirit was high more than one altar was richer of his vows the roman genius was still president on the three pillars only six hundred feet away were fame increase of fortune promotions and triumph ineffably sweetened by hate all in store him that moment malluch in the gallery saw lean forward over his arabs and give them the reins out ﬂew the lash in his hand over the backs of the startled steeds it writhed and hissed and hissed and writhed again and again and though it fell not there were both sting and menace in its quick report and the man passed thus from quiet to resistless action his face suffused his eyes gleaming along the reins he seemed to ﬂash his will and instantly not one but the four one answered with leap that landed them alongside the roman s car messala on the perilous edge of the goal heard but dared not look to see what the awakening portended from the people he received sign above the noises of the race there was but one voice and that was hur s in the old aramaic the sheik himself he called to the arabs on atair on rigel what antares dost thou linger now good aldebaran i hear them singing in the tents i hear the children singing and the of the stars of atair antares rigel aldebaran victory the song will never end well done home under the black on antares the tribe is waiting us and the master is waiting tis done tis done ha ha we have overthrown the proud the hand that smote us is in the dust ours the glory ha ha the work is rest there had never been anything of the kind more simple seldom anything so instantaneous at the moment chosen the dash messala was moving in circle round the goal to pass him had to cross the track and good strategy required the movement to be in forward direction that is on like circle limited to the least possible increase the thousands on the benches understood it all they saw the signal magniﬁcent response the four close outside messala s outer wheel s inner wheel behind the other s this they saw then they heard crash loud enough to send thrill through the circus and quicker than thought out over the course spray of shining white and yellow ﬂinders ﬂew down on its right side toppled the bed of the roman s chariot there was rebound of the axle hitting the hard earth another and another then the car went to pieces and messala entangled in the reins pitched forward headlong to increase the horror of the sight by making death certain the sidonian who had the wall next behind could not stop or turn out into the wreck full speed he drove then over the roman and into the latter s four all mad with fear presently out of the turmoil the ﬁghting of horses the resound of blows the murky cloud of dust and sand he crawled in time to see the corinthian and project gutenberg https on down the course after who had not been an instant delayed the people arose and leaped upon the benches and shouted and screamed those who looked that way caught glimpses of messala now under the trampling of the fours now under the abandoned cars he was still they thought him dead but far the greater number followed in his caree they had not seen the cunning touch of the reins by which turning little to the left he caught messala s wheel with the point of his axle and crushed it but they had seen the trans formation of the man and themselves felt the heat and glow of his spirit the heroic resolution the maddening energy of action with which by look word and gesture he so suddenly inspired his arabs and such running it was rather the long leaping of lions in harness but the lumbering chariot it seemed the four were ﬂying when the byzantine and corinthian were halfway down the course turned the ﬁrst goal and the race was won the consul arose the people shouted themselves hoarse the editor came down from his seat and crowned the victors the fortunate man among the boxers was haired saxon of such brutalized face to attract second look from who recognized teach er with whom he himself had been favorite at rome from him the young jew looked up and beheld simonides and his party on the balcony they waved their hands to him esther kept her seat but iras arose and gave him smile and wave of her not the less intoxicating to him because we know reader they would have fallen to messala had he been the victor the procession was then formed and midst the shouting of the multitude which had had its will passed out of the gate of triumph and the day was over project gutenberg https xv tarried across the river with ilderim at midnight previously determined they would take the road which the caravan then thirty hours out had pursued the sheik was happy his offers of gifts had been royal but hur had refused everything insisting that he was satisﬁed with the humiliation of his enemy the generous dispute was long continued think the sheik would say what thou hast done in every black tent down to the akaba and to the ocean and across to the euphrates and beyond to the sea of the scythians the renown of my mira and her children will go and they who sing of them will magnify and forget that i am in the wane of life and all the spears now masterless will come to and my multiply past counting thou dost not know what it is to have sway of the desert such will now be mine i tell thee it will bring tribute incalculable from commerce and immunity from kings ay by the sword of solomon doth my messenger seek favor of cæsar that will he get yet and would answer nay sheik have i not thy hand and heart let thy increase of power and inﬂuence inure to the king who comes who shall say it was not allowed thee him in the work i am going to i may have great need saying now will leave to ask of thee with better grace hereafter in the midst of controversy of the kind two messengers and one unknown the former was admitted ﬁrst the good fellow did not attempt to hide his joy over the event of the day but coming to that with which i am charged he said the master simonides sends to say that upon the adjournment of the games some of the roman faction made haste to protest against payment of the money ilderim started up crying in his shrillest tones by the splendor of god the east shall decide whether the race was fairly nay good sheik said malluch the editor has paid the money tis when they said struck messala s wheel the editor laughed and reminded them of the blow the arabs had at the turn of the and what of the athenian he is dead cried dead echoed ilderim what fortune these roman monsters have messala escaped project gutenberg https sheik with life but it shall be burden to him the physicians say he will live but never walk looked silently up to heaven he had vision of messala chairbound like simonides and like him going abroad on the shoulders of servants the good man had abode well but what would this one with his pride and ambition simonides bade say further malluch continued sanballat is having trouble drusus and those who signed with him referred the question of paying the ﬁve talents they lost to the consul maxentius and he has referred it to cæsar messala also refused his losses and sanballat in imitation of drusus went to the consul where the matter is still in advisement the better romans say the protestants shall not be excused and all the adverse factions join with them the city rings with the what says simonides asked the master laughs and is well pleased if the roman pays he is ruined if he refuses to pay he is dishonored the imperial policy will decide the matter to offend the east would be bad beginning with the parthians to offend sheik ilderim would be to antagonize the desert over which lie all maxentius s lines of operation wherefore simonides bade tell you to have disquiet messala will pay ilderim was at once restored to his let us be off now he said rubbing his hands the business will well with simonides the glory is ours i will order the stay said malluch i left messenger outside will you see him by the splendor of god i got malluch retired and was succeeded by lad of gentle manners and delicate appearance who knelt upon one knee and said winningly iras the daughter of balthasar well known to good sheik ilderim hath intrusted with message to the sheik who she saith will her great favor so he receive her congratulations on account of the victory of his four the daughter of my friend is kind said ilderim with sparkling eyes thou give her this jewel in sign of the pleasure i have from her he took ring from his ﬁnger he spoke i will thou sayest sheik the lad replied and continued the daughter of the egyptian charged further she prays the good sheik ilderim to send word to the youth that her father hath taken residence time in the palace of idernee where she will receive the youth after the fourth hour and if with her congratulations sheik ilderim will accept her gratitude this other favor done she will be ever so the sheik looked at whose face was suffused with pleasure what will you he asked by your leave sheik i will see the fair ilderim laughed and said shall not man enjoy his youth then answered the messenger say to her who sent you that i will see her at the palace of idernee wherever that may be at project gutenberg https lad arose and with silent salute departed at midnight ilderim took the road having arranged to leave horse and guide who was to follow project gutenberg https xvi going next day to ﬁll his appointment with iras turned from the omphalus which was in the heart of the city into the colonnade of herod and came shortly to the palace of idernee from the street he passed ﬁrst into vestibule on the sides of which were stairways under cover leading up to portico winged lions sat by the stairs in the middle there was gigantic ibis spouting water over the ﬂoor the lions ibis walls and ﬂoor were reminders of the egyptians everything even the balustrading of the stairs was of massive gray stone above the vestibule and covering the landing of the steps arose the portico pillared grace so light so exquisitely proportioned it was at that period hardly possible of conception except by greek of marble snowy white its effect was that of lily dropped carelessly upon great bare rock paused in the shade of the portico to admire its tracery and ﬁnish and the purity of its marble then he passed on into the palace ample stood open to receive him the passage into which he ﬁrst entered was high but somewhat narrow red tiling formed the ﬂoor and the walls were tinted to correspond yet this plainness was warning of something beautiful to come he moved on slowly all his faculties in repose presently he would be in the presence of iras she was waiting him waiting with song and story and badinage sparkling fanciful with smiles which gloriﬁed her glance and glances which lent voluptuous suggestion to her whisper she had sent him the evening of the on the lake in the orchard of palms she had sent him now and he was going to her in the beautiful palace of idernee he was happy and dreamful rather than thoughtless the passage brought him to closed door in front of which he paused and he did so the broad leaves began to open of themselves without creak or sound of lock or latch or touch of foot or ﬁnger the singularity was lost in the view that broke upon him standing in the shade of the dull passage and looking through the doorway he beheld the atrium of roman house roomy and rich to fabulous degree of magniﬁcence how large the chamber was can not be stated because of the deceit there is in exact proportions its depth was something never to be said of an equal interior when he stopped to make survey and looked down upon the ﬂoor he was standing upon the breast of leda represented caressing swan and looking farther he saw the whole ﬂoor was similarly laid in mosaic pictures of mythological subjects and there were stools and chairs each separate design and work of art exquisitely composed and tables much carven and here and there couches which were invitations of themselves the articles of furniture which stood out from the walls were duplicated on the project gutenberg https if they ﬂoated unrippled water even the panelling of the walls the ﬁgures upon them in painting and and the fresco of the ceiling were reﬂected on the ﬂoor the ceiling curved up towards the centre where there was an opening through which the sunlight poured without hindrance and the sky ever so blue seemed in the impluvium under the opening was guarded by bronzed rails the gilded pillars supporting the roof at the edges of the opening shone like ﬂame where the sun struck them and their reﬂections beneath seemed to stretch to inﬁnite depth and there were candelabra quain t and curious and statuary and vases the whole making an interior that would have beﬁtted well the house on the palatine hill which cicero bought of crassus or that other yet more famous extravagance the tusculan villa of scaurus still in his dreamful mood sauntered about charmed by all he beheld and waiting he did not mind little delay when iras was ready she would come or send servant in every regulated roman house the atrium was the reception chamber visitors twice thrice he made the round often he stood under the opening in the roof and pondered the sky and its azure depth then leaning against pillar he studied the distribution of light and shade and its effects here veil diminishing objects there brilliance exaggerating others yet nobody came time or rather the passage of time began at length to impress itself upon him and he wondered why iras stayed so long again he traced out the ﬁgures upon the ﬂoor but not with the satisfaction the ﬁrst inspection gave him he paused often to listen directly impatience blew little fevered breath upon his spirit next time it blew stronger and hotter and at last he woke to consciousness of the silence which held the house in thrall and the thought of it made him uneasy and distrustful still he put the feeling off with smile and promise oh she is giving the last touch to her eyelids or she is arranging chaplet she will come presently more beautiful of the delay he sat down then to admire candelabrum bronze plinth on rollers ﬁligree on the sides and edges the post at one end and on the end opposite it an altar and female celebrant the swinging by delicate chains from the extremities of drooping altogether wonder in its way but the silence would obtrude itself he listened even he looked at the pretty listened but there was not sound the palace was still tomb there might be mistake the messe nger had come from the egyptian and this was the palace of idernee then he remembered how mysteriously the door had opened so soundlessly so of itself he would see he went to the same door though he walked ever so lightly the sound of his stepping was loud and harsh and he shrank from it he was getting nervous the cumbrous roman lock resisted his ﬁrst effort to raise it and the the blood chilled in his wrenched with all his might in door was not even shaken sense of danger seized him and moment he stood irresolute who in antioch had the motive to him harm messala project gutenberg https this palace of idernee he had seen egypt in the vestibule athens in the snowy portico but here in the atrium was rome everything about him betrayed roman ownership true the site was on the great thoroughfare of the city very public place in which to him violence but that reason it was more accordant with the audacious genius of his enemy the atrium underwent change with all its elegance and beauty it was more than trap apprehension always paints in black the idea irritated there were many doors on the right and left of the atrium leading doubtless to he tried them but they were all ﬁrmly fastened knocking might bring response ashamed to make outcry he betook himself to couch and lying down tried to reﬂect all too plainly he was prisoner but what purpose and by whom if the work were messala s he sat up looked about and smiled deﬁantly there were weapons in every table but birds had been starved in golden cages not so would couches would serve him and he was strong and there was such increase of might in rage and despair messala himself could not come he would never walk again he was cripple like simonides still he could move others and where were there not others to be moved by him arose and tried the doors again once he calle d out the room echoed so that he was startled with such calmness he could assume he made up his mind to wait time before attempting to break way out in such situation the mind has its ebb and ﬂow of disquiet with intervals of peace between at long though he could not have came to the conclusion that the affair was an accident or mistake the palace certainly belonged to somebody it must have care and keeping and the keeper would come the evening or the night would bring him patience so concluding he waited half an hour much longer period to the door which had admitted him opened and closed noiselessly before and without attracting his attention the moment of the occurrence he was sitting at the farther end of the room footstep startled him at last she has come he thought with throb of relief and pleasure and arose the step was heavy and accompanied with the gride and clang of coarse sandals the gilded pillars were between him and the door he advanced quietly and leaned against one of them presently he heard voices of of them rough and guttural what was said he could not understand the language was not of the east or south of europe after general survey of the room the strangers crossed to their left and were brought into s men one very stout both tall and both in short tunic they had not the air of masters of the house or domestics everything they saw appeared wonderful to them everything they stopped to examine they touched they were vulgarians the atrium seemed profaned by their presence at the same time their leisurely manner and project gutenberg https with which they proceeded pointed to some right or business if business with whom with much jargon they sauntered this way and that all the time gradually approaching the pillar by which was standing off little way where slanted gleam of the sun fell with glare upon the mosaic of the ﬂoor there was statue which attracted their notice in examining it they stopped in the light the mystery surrounding his own presen ce in the palace tended we have seen to make nervous so now when in the tall stout stranger he recognized the northman whom he had known in rome and seen crowned only the day before in the circus the winning pugilist when he saw the man s face scarred with the wounds of many battles and imbruted by ferocious passions when he surveyed the fellow s naked limbs very marvels of exercise and trainin g and his shoulders of herculean breadth thought of personal danger started chill along every vein sure instinct warned him that the opportunity murder was too perfect to have come by chance and here now were the myrmidons and their business was with him he turned an anxious eye upon the northman s eyed and altogether jewish in appearance he observed also that both the men were in costume exactly such professionals of their class were in the habit of wearing in the arena putting the several circumstances together could not be longer in doubt he had been lured into the palace with design out of reach of aid in this splendid privacy he was to die at loss what to he gazed from man to man while there was enacted within him that miracle of mind by which life is passed before us in awful detail to be looked at by ourselves if it were another s and from the evolvement from hidden depth cast up it were by hidden hand he was given to see that he had entered upon new life different from the old one in this whereas in that he had been the victim of violences done to him henceforth he was to be the aggressor only yesterday he had found his ﬁrst victim to the purely christian nature the presentation would have brought the weakness of remorse not so with his spirit had its emotions from the teachings of the ﬁrst lawgiver not the last and greatest one he had dealt punishment not wrong to messala by permission of the lord he had triumphed and he derived faith from the the source of all rational strength especially strength in peril nor did the inﬂuence stop there the new life was made appear to him mission just begun and holy the king to come was holy and certain the coming of the king was mission in which force was lawful if only because it was unavoidable should he on the very threshold of such an errand be afraid he undid the sash around his waist and baring his head and casting off his white jewish gown stood forth in an undertunic not unlike those of the enemy and was ready body and mind folding his arms he placed his back against the pillar and calmly waited the examination of the statue was brief directly the northman turned and said something in the unknown tongue then both looked at few more words and they advanced towards him who are you he asked in project gutenberg https northman fetched smile which did not relieve his face of its brutalism and answered this is the palace of idernee whom seek you stand and answer the words were spoken with earnestness the strangers stopped and in his turn the northman asked who are you the giant laid his head back upon his shoulders ha ha ha i have heard how god once came from cow licking salted stone but not even god can make roman of the laugh over he spoke to his companion again and they moved nearer hold said quitting the pillar one they stopped again word replied the saxon folding his immense arms across his breast and relaxing the menace beginning to blacken his face word you are thord the the giant opened his blue eyes you were lanista in thord nodded i was your scholar said thord shaking his head by the beard of irmin i had never jew to make but i will prove my how you came here to kill that is then let this man ﬁght singly and i will make the proof on his body gleam of humor shone in the northm an s face he spoke to his companion who made answer then he replied with the naivete of diverted child wait till i say by repeated touches of his foot he pushed couch out on the ﬂoor and proceeded leisurely to stretc h his burly form upon it when perfectly at ease he said simply now without ado walked to his antagonist defend thyself he said the man nothing loath put up his hands the two thus confronted each other in approved position there was discernible inequality betw een them on the contrary they were like brothers to the stranger s conﬁdent smile opposed an earnestness which had his skill been known would have been accepted fair warning of danger both knew the combat was to be mortal feinted with his right hand the stranger warded slightly advancing his left arm ere he could return to guard hur caught him by the wrist in grip which years at the oar project gutenberg https terrible vise the surprise was complete and time given to throw himself forward to push the arm across the man s throat and over his right shoulder and turn him left side front to strike surely with the ready left hand to strike the bare neck under the but petty divisions of the same act need of second blow the myrmidon fell heavily and without cry and lay still turned to thord ha what by the beard of irmin the latter cried in astonishment rising to sitting posture then he laughed ha ha ha i could not have done it better he viewed coolly from head to foot and rising faced him with undisguised admiration it was my trick i have practised ten years in the schools of rome you are not jew who are you you knew arrius the duumvir quintus arrius yes he was my he had yes said thord his battered features lighting dully i knew the boy he would have made king gladiator cæsar offered him his patronage i taught him the very trick you played on this one trick impossible except to hand and arm like mine it has won many i am that son of thord drew nearer and viewed him carefully then his eyes brightened with genuine pleasure and laughing he held out his hand ha ha ha he told i would ﬁnd jew dog of whom was serving the who told you so asked taking the hand ha ha when thord last i thought he was he will never walk again on his bed he told between very vivid portrayal of hate in few words and saw that the roman if he lived would still be capable and dangerous and follow him unrelentingly revenge remained to sweeten the ruined life therefore the clinging to fortune lost in the wager with sanballat ran the ground over with distinct foresight of the many ways in which it would be possible his enemy to interfere with him in the work he had undertaken the king who was coming why not he resort to the roman s methods the man hired to kill him could be hired to strike back it was in his power to offer higher wages the temptation was strong and half yielding he chanced to look down at his late antagonist lying still with white upturned face so like himself light came to him and he asked thord what was messala to give you killing thousand you shall have them yet and so you now what i tell you i will add three thousand more to the the giant reﬂected project gutenberg https i won ﬁve thousand yesterday from the roman give four good i will stand ﬁrm you though old thor my namesake strike with his hammer make it four and i will kill the lying patrician if you say so i have only to cover his mouth with my he illustrated the process by clapping his hand over his own mouth i see said ten thousand sestertii is fortune it will enable you to return to rome and open near the great circus and live becomes the ﬁrst of the the very scars on the giant s face glowed afresh with the pleasure the picture gave him i will make it four thousand continued and in what you shall the money there will be blood on your hands thord hear now did not your friend here look like i would have said he was an apple from the same well if i put on his tunic and dress him in these clothes of mine and you and i go away together leaving him here can you not get your sestertii from messala all the same you have only to make him believe it that is thord laughed till the tears ran into his mouth ha ha ha ten thousand sestertii were never won so easily and by the great circus lie without blood in it ha ha ha give thy hand son of arrius get on now ha ha ever you come to rome fail not to ask the of thord the northman by the beard of irmin i will give you the best though i borrow it from cæsar they shook hands again after which the exchange of clothes was effected it was arranged then that messenger should go at night to thord s with the four thousand sestertii when they were done the giant knocked at the front door it opened to him and passing out of the atrium he led into room adjoining where the latter completed his attire from the coarse garments of the dead pugilist they separated directly in the omphalus fail not son of arrius fail not the near the great circus ha ha ha by the beard of irmin there was never fortune gained so cheap the gods keep you upon leaving the atrium gave last look at the myrmidon he lay in the jewish vestments and was satisﬁed the likeness was striking if thord kept faith the cheat was secret to endure forever at night in the house of simonides told the good man all that had taken place in the palace of idernee and it was agreed that after few days public inquiry should be set aﬂoat the discovery of the whereabouts of the son of arrius eventually the matter was to be carried boldly to maxentius then if the mystery came not out it was concluded that messala and gratus would be at rest and happy and free to betake himself to jerusalem to make search his lost project gutenberg https the simonides sat in his chair out on the terrace overlooking the river and gave his farewell and the peace of the lord with the impressment of father esther went with the young man to the head of the steps if i ﬁnd my mother esther thou shalt go to her at jerusalem and be sister to and with the words he kissed her was it only kiss of peace he crossed the river next to the late quarters of ilderim where he found the arab who was to serve him guide the horses were brought out this one is thine said the arab looked and lo it was aldebaran the swiftest and brightest of the sons of mira and next to sirius the beloved of the sheik and he knew the old man s heart came to him along with the gift the corpse in the atrium was taken up and buried by night and part of messala s plan courier was sent off to gratus to make him at rest by the announcement of s time past question ere long was opened near the circus maximus with inscription over the door thord the project gutenberg https sixth is that death and are there two is death that woman s mate her skin was white leprosy the nightmare was she who thicks man s blood with project gutenberg https i our story moves forward now thirty days from the night hur left antioch to go out with sheik ilderim into the desert great change has at least respects the fortunes of our hero valerius gratus has been succeeded by pontius pilate the removal it may be remarked cost simonides exactly ﬁve talents roman money in hand paid to sejanus who was then in height of power imperial favorite the object being to help hur by lessening his exposure while in and about jerusalem attempting discovery of his people to such pious use the faithful servant put the winnings from drusus and his associates all of whom having paid their wagers becam at once and naturally the enemies of messala whose repudiation was yet an unsettled question in rome brief the time was already the jews knew the change of rulers was not the better the cohorts sent to relieve the garrison of antonia made their entry into the city by night next morning the ﬁrst sight that greeted the people resident in the neighborhood was the walls of the old tower decorated with military ensigns which unfortunately consisted of busts of the emperor mixed with eagles and globes multitude in passion marched to cæsarea where pilate was lingering and implored him to remove the detested images five days and nights they beset his palace gates at last he appointed meeting with them in the circus when they were assembled he encircled them with soldiers instead of resisting they offered him their lives and conquered he recalled the images and ensigns to cæsarea where gratus with more consideration had kept such abominations housed during the eleven years of his reign the worst of men once in while vary their wickednesses by good acts so with pilate he ordered an inspection of all the prisons in judea and return of the names of the persons in custody with statement of the crimes which they had been committed doubtless the motive was the one so common with ofﬁcials just of entailed responsibility the people however in thought of the good which might come of the measure gave him credit and period were comforted the revelations were astonishing hundreds of persons were released against whom there were accusations many others came to light who had long been accounted dead yet more amazing there was opening of dungeons not merely unknown at the time by the people but actually forgotten by the prison authorities with one instance of the latter kind we have now to deal and strange to say it occurred in jerusalem the tower of antonia which will be remembered occupying two thirds of the sacred area on moun t moriah was originally castle built by the macedonians afterwards john hyrcanus erected the castle into fortress the defence of the temple and in his day it was considered impregnable to assault but when herod came with his bolder genius he strengthened its walls project gutenberg https them leaving vast pile which included every appurtenance necessary the stronghold he intended it to be forever such ofﬁces barracks armories magazines cisterns and last though not least prisons of all grades he levelled the solid rock and tapped it with deep excavations and built over them connecting the whole great mass with the temple by beautiful colonnade from the roof of which one could look down over the courts of the sacred structure in such condition the tower fell at last out of his hands into those of the romans who were quick to see its strength and advantages and convert it to uses becoming such masters all through the administration of gratus it had been garrisoned citadel and under ground prison terrible to revolutionists woe when the cohorts poured from its gates to suppress disorder woe not less when jew passed the same gates going in under arrest with this explanation we hasten to our story the order of the new procurator requiring report of the persons in custody was received at the tower of antonia and promptly executed and two days have gone since the last unfortunate was brought up examination the tabulated statement ready forwarding lies on the table of the tribune in command in ﬁve minutes more it will be on the way to pilate sojourning in the palace up on mount zion the tribune s ofﬁce is spacious and cool and furnished in style suitable to the dignity of the commandant of post in every respect so important looking in upon him about the seventh hour of the day the ofﬁcer appears weary and impatient when the report is despatched he will to the roof of the colonnade air and exercise and the amusement to be had watching the jews over in the courts of the temple his subordinates and clerks share his impatience in the spell of waiting man appeared in doorway leading to an adjoining apartment he rattled bunch of keys each heavy hammer and at once attracted the chief s attention ah gesius come in the tribune said the approached the table behind which the chief sat in an everybody present looked at him and observing certain expression of alarm and mortiﬁcation on his face became silent that they might hear what he had to say tribune he began bending low i fear to tell what now i bring another gesius if i could persuade myself it is but mistake i would not be crime worse breach of duty thou mayst laugh at cæsar or curse the gods and live but if the offence be to the thou knowest on it is now about eight years since valerius gratus selected to be keeper of prisoners here in the tower said the man deliberately i remember the morning i entered upon the duties of my ofﬁce there had been riot the day before and ﬁghting in the streets we slew many jews and suffered on our side the project gutenberg https it was said of an attempt to assassinate gratus who had been knocked from his horse by tile thrown from roof i found him sitting where you now sit tribune his head swathed in bandages he told of my selection and gave these keys numbered to correspond with the numb ers of the cells they were the badges of my ofﬁce he said and not to be parted with there was roll of parchment on the table calling to him he opened the roll here are maps of the cells said he there were three of them this one he went on shows the arrangement of the upper ﬂoor this second one gives you the second ﬂoor and this last is of the lower ﬂoor i give them to you in i took them from his hand and he said further now you have the keys and the maps go immediately and acquaint yourself with the whole arrangement visit each cell and see to its condition when anything is needed the security of prisoner order it according to your judgment you are the master under and other i saluted him and turned to go away he called back ah i forgot he said give the map of the third i gave it to him and he spread it upon the table here gesius he said see this he laid his ﬁnger on the one numbered there are three men conﬁned in that cell desperate characters who by some means got hold of state secret and suffer their curiosity which looked at in such matters is worse than crime accordingly they are blind and tongueless and are placed there life they shall have nothing but food and drink to be given them through hole which you will ﬁnd in the wall covered by slide you hear gesius i made him answer it is well he continued one thing more which you shall not forget or looked at the door of their number on the same one gesius put his ﬁnger on the particular cell to impress my shall never be opened any purpose neither to let one in nor out not even but if they die i asked if they die he said the cell shall be their tomb they were put there to die and be lost the cell is leprous you understand with that he let gesius stopped and from the breast of his tunic drew three parchments all much yellowed by time and use selecting one of them he spread it upon the table before the tribune saying simply this is the lower ﬂoor the whole company looked at the map this is exactly tribune i had it from gratus see there is cell number said gesius i see the tribune replied go on now the cell was leprous he i would like to ask you question remarked the keeper modestly project gutenberg https tribune assented had i not right under the circumstan ces to believe the map true one what else couldst thou well it is not true the chief looked up surprised it is not true one the keeper repeated it shows but ﬁve cells upon that ﬂoor while there are six sayest thou i will show you the ﬂoor it i believe it to upon page of his tablets gesius drew the following diagram and gave it to the tribune thou hast done well said the tribune examining the drawing and thinking the narrative at an end i will have the map corrected or better i will have new one made and given thee come it in the so saying he arose but hear further gesius that which i have yet to tell will not the tribune resumed his chair i will hurry said the keeper humbly only let ask another question had i not right to believe gratus in what he further told to the prisoners in cell number yes it was thy duty to believe there were three prisoners in the of and without well said the keeper that was not true either said the tribune with returning interest hear and judge yourself tribune required i visited all the cells beginning with those on the ﬁrst ﬂoor and ending with those on the lower the order that the door of number should not be opened had been respected through all the eight years food and drink three men had been passed through hole in the wall i went to the door yesterday curious to see the wretches who against all expectation had lived so long the locks refused the key we pulled little and the door fell down rusted from its hinges going in i found but one man old blind tongueless and naked his hair droppe d in stiffened mats below his waist his skin was like the parchment there he held his hands out and the ﬁnger curled and twisted like the claws of bird i asked him where his companions were he shook his head in denial thinking to ﬁnd the others we searched the cell the project gutenberg https dry so were the walls if three men had been shut in there and two of them had died at least their bones would have wherefore thou i think tribune there has been but one prisoner there in the eight the chief regarded the keeper sharply and said have care thou art more than saying valerius gesius bowed but said he might have been he was right said the tribune warmly by thine own statement he was right didst thou not say but now that eight years food and drink had been furnished three men the bystanders approved the shrewdness of their chief yet gesius did not seem discomﬁted you have but half the story tribune when you have it all you will agree with you know what i did with the man that i sent him to the bath and had him shorn and clothed and then took him to the gate of the tower and bade him go free i washed my hands of him he came back and was brought to by signs and tears he at last made understand he wished to return to his cell and i so ordered they were leading him off he broke away and kissed my feet and by piteous dumb imploration insisted i should go with him and i went the mystery of the three men stayed in my mind i was not satisﬁed about it now i am glad i yielded to his entreaty the whole company at this point became very still when we were in the cell again and the prisoner knew it he caught my hand eagerly and led to hole like that through which we were accustomed to pass him his food though large enough to push your helmet through it escaped yesterday still holding my hand he put his face to the hole and gave cry sound came faintly back i was astonished and drew him away and called out ho here at ﬁrst there was answer i called again and received back these words be thou praised lord yet more astonishing tribune the voice was woman and i asked who are you and had reply woman of israel entombed here with her daughter help us quickly or we i told them to be of cheer and hurried here to know your the tribune arose hastily thou wert right gesius he said and i see now the map was lie and so was the tale of the three men there have been better romans than valerius yes said the keeper i gleaned from the prisoner that he had regularly given the women of the food and drink he had it is accounted replied the tribune and observing the countenances of his friends and reﬂecting how well it would be to have witnesses he added let us rescue the women come gesuis was pleased we will have to pierce the wall he said i found where door had been but it was ﬁlled solidly with stones and mortar the tribune stayed to say to clerk send workmen after with tools make haste but hold the report i see it will have to be in short time they were project gutenberg https ii woman of israel entombed here with her daughter help us quickly or we such was the reply gesius the keeper had from the cell which appears on his amended map vi the reader when he observed the answer knew who the unfortunates were and doubtless said to himself at last the mother of and tirzah his sister and so it was the morning of their seizure eight years before they had been carried to the tower where gratus proposed to put them out of the way he had chosen the tower the purpose more immediately in his own keeping and cell vi because ﬁrst it could be better lost than any other and secondly it was infected with leprosy these prisoners were not merely to be put in safe place but in place to die they were accordingly taken down by slaves in the when there were witnesses of the deed then in completion of the savage task the same slaves walled up the door after which they were themselves separated and sent away never to be heard of more to save accusation and in the event of discovery to leave himself such justiﬁcation might be allowed in distinction between the inﬂiction of punishment and the commission of double murder gratus preferred sinking his victims where natural death was certain though slow that they might linger along he selected convict who had been made blind and tongueless and sank him in the only connecting cell there to serve them with food and drink under circumstances could the poor wretch tell the tale or identify either the prisoners or their doomsman so with cunning partly due to messala the roman under color of punishing brood of assassins smoothed path to conﬁscation of the estate of the hurs of which portion ever reached the imperial cof fers the last step in the scheme gratus summarily removed the old keeper of the prisons not because he knew what had been done he did because knowing the under ground ﬂoors he did it would be next to impossible to keep the transaction from him then with masterly ingenuity the procurator had new maps drawn delivery to new keeper with the omission we have seen of cell vi the instructions given the latter taken with the omission on the map accomplished the cell and its unhappy tenants were all alike lost what may be thought of the life of the mother and daughter during the eight years must have relation to their culture and previous habits conditions are pleasant or grievous to us according to our sensibilities it is not extreme to say if there was sudden exit of all men from the world heaven preﬁgured in the christian idea would not be heaven to the majority on the other hand neither would all suffer equally in the tophet cultivation has its balances the mind is made intelligent the capacity of the soul pure enjoyment is proportionally increased well therefore if it be saved if lost however alas that it ever had cultivation its capacity enjoyment in the one case is project gutenberg https of its capacity to suffer in the other wherefore repentance must be something more than mere remorse sins it comprehends change of nature beﬁtting heaven we repeat to form an adequate idea of the suffering endured by the mother of the reader must think of her spirit and its sensibilities much if not more than of the conditions of the immurement the question being not what the conditions were but how she was affected by them and now we may be permitted to say it was in anticipation of this thought that the scene in the summer on the roof of the family palace was given so fully in the beginning of the second book of our story so too to be helpful when the inquiry should come up we ventured the elaborate description of the palace of the hurs in other words let the serene happy luxurious life in the princely house be recalled and contrasted with this existence in the lower dungeon of the tower of antonia then if the reader in his effort to realize the misery of the woman persists in mere reference to conditions physical he can not go amiss he is lover of his kind tender of heart he will be melted with much sympathy but will he go further will he more than sympathize with her will he share her agony of mind and spirit will he at least try to measure him recall her she discoursed to her son of god and nations and heroes one moment philosopher the next teacher and all the time mother would you hurt man keenest strike at his would you hurt woman worst aim at her af fections with quickened remembrance of these remembrance of them they t us go down and see them they are the cell vi was in form gesius drew it on his map of its dimensions but little idea can be had enough that it was roomy roughened interior with ledged and broken walls and ﬂoor in the beginning the site of the macedonian castle was separated from the site of the temple by narrow but deep cliff somewhat in shape of wedge the workmen wishing to hew out series of chambers made their entry in the north face of the cleft and worked in leaving ceiling of the natural stone delving farther they executed the cells with connection with number vi except through number in like manner they constructed the passage and stairs to the ﬂoor above the process of the work was precisely that resorted to in carving out the tombs of the kings yet to be seen short distance north of jerusalem only when the cutting was done cell vi was enclosed on its outer side by wall of prodigious stones in which ventilation narrow apertures were left bevelled like modern holes herod when he took hold of the temple and tower put facing yet more massive upon this outer wall and shut up all the apertures but one which yet admitted little vitalizing air and ray of light not nearly strong enough to redeem the room from darkness such was cell vi startle not now the description of the blind and tongueless wretch just liberated from cell may be accepted to break the horror of what is project gutenberg https two women are grouped close by the aperture one is seated the other is half reclining against her there is nothing between them and the bare rock the light slanting upwards strikes them with ghastly effect and we can not avoid seeing they are without vesture or covering at the same time we are helped to the knowledge that love is there yet the two are in each other s arms riches take wings comforts vanish hope withers away but love stays with us love is god where the two are thus grouped the stony ﬂoor is polished shining smooth who shall say how much of the eight years they have spent in that space there in front of the aperture nursing their hope of rescue by that timid yet friendly ray of light when the brightness came creeping in they knew it was dawn when it began to fade they knew the world was hushing the night which could not be anywhere so long and utterly dark with them the world through that crevice if it were broad and high king s gate they went to the world in thought and passed the weary time going up and down spirits go looking and asking the one her son the other her brother on the seas they sought him and on the islands of the seas he was in this city in that other and everywhere and at all times he was ﬂitting sojourner they lived waiting him he lived looking them how often their thoughts passed each other in the endless search his coming theirs going it was such sweet ﬂattery them to say to each other while he lives we shall not be forgotten long he remembers us there is hope the strength one can eke from little who knows till he has been subjected to the trial our recollections of them in former days enjoin us to be respectful their sorrows clothe them with sanctity without going too near across the dungeon we see they have under gone change of appearance not to be accounted by time or long conﬁnement the mother was beautiful woman the daughter beautiful child not even love could say so much now their hair is long unkempt and strangely white they make us shrink and shudder with an indeﬁnable repulsion though the effect may be from an illusory glozing of the light glimmering dismally through the unhealthy murk or they may be enduring the tortures of hunger and thirst not having had to eat or drink since their servant the convict was taken is since yesterday tirzah reclining against her mother in half embrace moans piteously be quiet tirzah they will come god is good we have been mindful of him and forgotten not to pray at every sounding of the trumpets over in the temple the light you see is still bright the sun is standing in the south sky yet and it is hardly more than the seventh hour somebody will come to us let us have faith god is thus the mother the words were simple and effective although eight years being now to be added to the thirteen she had attained when last we saw her tirzah was longer child i will try and be strong mother she said your suffering must be great mine and i so want to live you and my brother but my tongue burns my lips scorch i wonder where he is and if he will ever ever ﬁnd us project gutenberg https is something in the voices that strikes us unexpected tone sharp dry metallic unnatural the mother draws the daughter closer to her breast and says i dreamed about him last night and saw him plainly tirzah i see you we must believe in dreams you know because our fathers did the lord spoke to them so often in that way i thought we were in the women s court just before the gate beautiful there were many women with us and he came and stood in the shade of the gate and looked here and there at this one and that my heart beat strong i knew he was looking us and stretched my arms to him and ran calling him he heard and saw but he did not know in moment he was would it not be so mother if we were to meet him in fact we are so it might be so the mother s head droops and her face knits with wrench of pain recovering however she goes on but we could make ourselves known to tirzah tossed her arms and moaned again water mother water though but the mother stares around in blank helplessness she has named god so often and so often promised in his name the repetition is beginning to have mocking effect upon herself shadow passes before her dimming the dim light and she is brought down to think of death very near waiting to come in her faith goes out hardly knowing what she does speaking aimlessly because speak she must she says again patience tirzah they are are almost she thought she heard sound over by the little trap in the through which they held all their actual communication with the world and she was not mistaken moment and the cry of the convict rang through the cell tirzah heard it also and they both arose still keeping hold of each other praised be the lord forever exclaim ed the mother with the fervor of restored faith and hope ho there they heard next and then who are you the voice was strange what matter except from tirzah they were the ﬁrst and only words the mother had heard in eight years the revulsion was death to so instantly woman of israel entombed here with her daughter help us quickly or we be of cheer i will the women sobbed aloud they were found help was coming from wish to wish hope ﬂew the twittering swallows ﬂy they were found they would be released and restoration would follow to all they had society property son and brother the scanty light glozed them with the glory of day and forgetful of pain and thirst and hunger and of the menace of death they sank upon the ﬂoor and cried keeping fast hold of each other the while and this time they had not long to wait gesius the keeper told his tale methodically but ﬁnished it at last the tribune was prompt within there he shouted through the trap here said the mother project gutenberg https she heard another sound in another place of blows on the quick ringing and delivered with iron tools she did not speak nor did tirzah but they listened well knowing the meaning of it way to liberty was being made them so men long time buried in deep mines hear the coming of rescuers heralded by thrust of bar and beat of pick and answer gratefully with their eyes ﬁxed upon the spot whence the sounds proceed and they can not look away lest the work should cease and they be returned to despair the arms outside were strong the hands skillful the will good each instant the blows sounded more plainly now and then piece fell with crash and liberty came neare r and nearer presently the workmen could be heard speaking happiness crevice ﬂashed red ray of torches into the darkness it cut incisive diamond brilliance beautiful if from spear of the morning it is he mother it is he he has found us at last cried tirzah with the quickened fancy of youth but the mother answered meekly god is good block fell inside and great mass and the door was open man grimed with mortar and stepped in and stopped holding torch over his head two or three others followed with torches and stood aside the tribune to enter respect women is not all conventi onality it is the best proof of their proper nature the tribune stopped because they ﬂed from with fear be it said but shame nor yet reader from shame alone from the obscurity of their partial hiding he heard these words the saddest most dreadful most utterly despairing of the human tongue come not near unclean the men ﬂared their torches while they stared at each other unclean unclean came from the corner again slow tremulous wail exceedingly sorrowful with such cry we can imagine spirit vanishing from the gates of paradise looking back the while so the widow and mother performed her duty and in the moment realized that the freedom she had prayed and dreamed of fruit of scarlet and gold seen afar was but an apple of sodom in the hand she and tirzah possibly the reader does not know all the word means let him be told it with reference to the law of that time only little modiﬁed in this these four are accounted he blind the leper the poor and the thus the talmud that is to be leper was to be treated be excluded from the city corpse to be spoken to by the best beloved and most loving only at distance to dwell with none but lepers to be utterly unprivileged to be denied the rites of the temple and the synagogue to go about in rent garments and with covered mouth except when crying unclean unclean to ﬁnd home in the wilderness or in abandoned tombs to become materialized specter of hinnom and gehenna to be at all times less living offence to others than breathing torment to self afraid to die yet without hope except in project gutenberg https might not tell the day or the year down in the haunted hell even time was the mother felt dry scurf in the palm of her right hand triﬂe which she tried to wash away it clung to the member pertinaciously yet she thought but little of the sign till tirzah complained that she too was attacked in the same way the supply of water was scant and they denied themselves drink that they might use it curative at length the whole hand was attacked the skin cracked open the ﬁngernails loosened from the ﬂesh there was not much pain withal chieﬂy steadily increasing discomfort later their lips began to parch and seam one day the mother who was cleanly to godliness and struggled against the impurities of the dungeon with all ingenuity thinking the enemy was taking hold on tirzah s face led her to the light and looking with the inspiration of terrible dread lo the young girl s eyebrows were white snow oh the anguish of that assurance the mother sat awhile speechless motionless paralyzed of soul and capable of but one leprosy when she began to think mother it was not of herself but her child and mother her natural tenderness turned to courage and she made ready the last sacriﬁce of perfect heroism she buried her knowledge in her heart hopeless herself she redoubled her devotion to tirzah and with wonderful chieﬂy in its very continued to keep the daughter ignorant of what they were beset with and even hopeful that it was nothing she repeated her little games and retold her stories and invented new ones and listened with ever so much pleasure to the songs she would have from tirzah while on her own wasting lips the psalms of the singing king and their race served to bring soothing of forgetfulness and keep alive in them both the recollection of the god who would seem to have abandoned world not more lightly or utterly slowly steadily with horrible certainty the disease spread after while bleaching their heads white eating holes in their lips and eyelids and covering their bodies with scales then it fell to their throats shrilling their voices and to their joints hardening the tissues and and the mother well knew past remedy it was affecting their lungs and arteries and bones at each advance making the sufferers more and more loathsome and so it would continue till death which might be years before them another day of dread at length day the mother under impulsion of duty at last told tirzah the name of their ailment and the two in agony of despair prayed that the end might come quickly still is the force of habit these so afﬂicted grew in time not merely to speak composedly of their disease they beheld the hideous transformation of their persons of course and in despite clung to existence one tie to earth rema ined to them unmindful of their own loneliness they kept up certain spirit by talking and dreaming of the mother promised reunion with him to the sister and she to the mother not doubting either of them that he was equally faithful to them and would be equally happy of the meeting and with the spinning and respinning of this slender thread they found pleasure and excused their not dying in such manner we have seen they were solacing themselves project gutenberg https gesius called them at the end of twelve hours fasting and thirst the torches ﬂashed redly through the dungeon and liberty was come god is good the widow what had been reader but what was in thankfulness present mercy nothing so becomes us losing sight of past ills the tribune came directly then in the corner to which she had ﬂed suddenly sense of duty smote the elder of the women and straightway the awful unclean unclean ah the pang the effort to acquit herself of that duty cost the mother not all the selﬁshness of joy over the prospect could keep her blind to the consequences of release now that it was at hand the old happy life could never be again if she went near the house called home it would be to stop at the gate and cry unclean unclean she must go about with the yearnings of love alive in her breast strong ever and more sensitive even because return in kind could not be the boy of whom she had so constantly thought and with all sweet promises such mothers ﬁnd their purest delight in must at meeting her stand afar off if he held out his hands to her and called mother mother very love of him she must answer unclean unclean and this other child before whom in want of other covering she was spreading her long tangled locks bleached unnaturally that she was she must continue sole partner of her blasted remainder of life yet reader the brave woman accepted the lot and took up the cry which had been its sign immemorially and which thenceforward was to be her salutation without unclean unclean the tribune heard it with tremor but kept his place who are you he asked two women dying of hunger and thirst yet mother did not come not near us nor touch the ﬂoor or the wall unclean unclean give thy story name and when thou wert put here and by whom and there was once in this city of jerusalem prince the friend of all generous romans and who had cæsar his friend i am his widow and this one with is his child how may i tell you what we were sunk here when i not know unless it was because we were rich valerius gratus can tell you who our enemy was and when our imprisonment began i can not see to what we have been see and have pity the air was heavy with the pest and the smoke of the torches yet the roman called one of the to his side and wrote the answer nearly word word it was terse and comprehensive containing at once history an accusation and prayer common person could have made it and he could not but pity and believe thou shalt have relief woman he said closing the tablets i will send thee food and and raiment and purifying water we pray you generous roman thou wilt he replied god is good said the widow sobbing may his peace abide with you project gutenberg https and further he added i can not see thee again make preparation and i will have thee taken to the gate of the tower and set free thou knowest the law he spoke to the men and went out the door very shortly some slaves came to the cell with large gurglet of water basin and napkins platter with bread and meat and some garments of women s wear and setting them down within reach of the prisoners they ran away about the middle of the ﬁrst watch the two were conducted to the gate and turned into the street so the roman quit himself of them and in the city of their fathers they were once more free up to the stars twinkling merrily of old they looked then they asked themselves what next and where to project gutenberg https iii about the hour gesius the keeper made his appearance before the tribune in the tower of antonia footman was climbing the eastern face of mount olivet the road was rough and dusty and vegetation on that side burned brown it was the dry season in judea well the traveller that he had youth and strength not to speak of the cool ﬂowing garments with which he was clothed he proceeded slowly looking often to his right and left not with the vexed anxious expression which marks man going forward uncertain of the way but rather the air with which one approaches old acquaintance after long of pleasure half of inquiry if he were saying i am glad to be with you again let see in what you are he arose higher he sometimes paused to look behind him over the gradually widening view termi nating in the mountains of moab but when at length he drew near the summit he quickened his step unmindful of fatigue and hurried on without pause or turning of the face on the reach which he bent his steps somewhat right of the beaten came to dead stop arrested if by strong hand then one might have seen his eyes dilate his cheeks ﬂush his breath quicken effects all of one bright sweeping glance at what lay before him the traveller good reader was other than the spectacle jerusalem not the holy city of but the holy city left by herod holy city of the christ beautiful yet seen from old olivet what must it have been then betook him to stone and sat down and stripping his head of the close white handkerchief which served it covering made the survey at leisure the same has been done often since by great variety of persons under circumstances surpassingly the son of vespasian by the islamite by the crusader conquerors all of them by many pilgrim from the great new world which waited discovery nearly ﬁfteen hundred years after the time of our story but of the multitude probably not one has taken that view with sensations more keenly poignant more sadly sweet more proudly bitter than he was stirred by recollections of his countrymen their triumphs and vicissitudes their history the history of god the city was of their building at once lasting testimony of their crimes and devotion their weakness and genius their religion and their irreligion though he had seen rome to familiarity he was gratiﬁed the sight ﬁlled measure of pride which would have made him drunk with vainglory but the thought princely the property was it did not any longer belong to his countrymen the worship in the temple was by permission of strangers the hill where david dwelt was marbled ofﬁce in which the chosen of the lord were wrung and wrung taxes and scour ged very deathlessness of faith these however were pleasures and griefs of patriotism common to every jew of the period in addition brought with him project gutenberg https history which would not out of mind other consideration whatever which the spectacle served only to freshen and vivify country of hills changes but little where the hills are of rock it changes not at all the scene r beheld is the same now except respects the city the failure is in the handiwork of man alone the sun dealt more kindly by the west side of olivet than by the east and men were certainly more loving towards it the vines with which it was partially clad and the sprinkling of trees chieﬂy ﬁgs and old wild olives were comparatively green down to the dry bed of the cedron the verdure extended refreshment to the

soldier studies country in which he has projected campaign messenger came one evening with the news that gratus was removed and pontius pilate sent to take his place messala was disabled and believed him dead gratus was powerless and gone why should ur longer defer the search his mother and sister there was nothing to fear now if he could not himself see into the prisons of judea he could examine them with the eyes of others if the lost were found pilate could have motive in holding them in at least which could not be overcome by purchase if found he would carry them to place of safety and then in calmer mind his conscience at rest this one ﬁrst duty done he could give himself more entirely to the king who was coming he resolved at once that night he counselled with ilderim and obtained his assent three arabs came with him to jericho where he left them and the horses and proceeded alone and on foot malluch was to meet him in jerusalem s scheme be it observed was yet generality in view of the future it was advisable to keep himself in hiding from the authorities particularly the romans malluch was shrewd and trusty the very man to charge with the conduct of the investigation where to begin was the ﬁrst point he had clear idea about it his wish was to commence with the tower of antonia tradition not of long standing planted the gloomy pile over labyrinth of which more even than the strong garrison kept it terror to the jewish fancy burial such his people had been subjected to might be possible there besides in such strait the natural inclination is to start search at the place where the loss occurred and he could not forget that his last sight of the loved ones was the guard pushed them along the street in the direction to the tower if they were not there now but had been some record of the fact must remain clew which had only to be followed faithfully to the project gutenberg https this inclination moreover there was hope which he could not forego from simonides he knew amrah the egyptian nurse was living it will be remembered doubtless that the faithful creature the morning the calamity overtook the hurs broke from the guard and ran back into the palace where along with other chattels she had been sealed up during the years following simonides kept her supplied so she was there now sole occupant of the great house which with all his offers gratus had not been able to sell the story of its rightful owners sufﬁced to secure the property from strangers whether purchasers or mere occupants people going to and fro passed it with whispers its reputation was that of haunted house derived probably from the infrequent glimpses of poor old amra h sometimes on the roof sometimes in latticed window certainly more constant spirit ever abided than she nor was there ever tenement so shunned and ﬁtted ghostly habitation now if he could get to her hur fancied she could help him to know ledge which though faint might yet be serviceable anyhow sight of her in that place so endeared by recollection would be to him pleasure next to ﬁnding the objects of his solicitude so ﬁrst of all things he would go to the old house and look amrah thus resolved he arose shortly after the of the sun and began descent of the mount by the road which from the summit bends little north of east dow n nearly at the foot close by the bed of the cedron he came to the intersection with the road leading south to the village of siloam and the pool of that name there he fell in with herdsman driving some sheep to market he spoke to the man and joined him and in his company passed by gethsemane on into the city through the fish project gutenberg https iv it was dark when parting with the drover inside the gate hur turned into narrow lane leading to the south few of the people whom he met saluted him the bouldering of the pavement was rough the houses on both sides were low dark and cheerless the doors all closed from the roofs occasionally he heard women crooning to children the loneliness of his situation the night the uncertainty cloaking the object of his coming all affected him cheerlessly with feelings sinking lower and lower he came directly to the deep reservoir now known the pool of bethesda in which the water reﬂected the sky looking up he beheld the northern wall of the tower of antonia black frowning heap reared into the dim sky he halted if challenged by threatening sentinel the tower stood up so high and seemed so vast resting apparently upon foundations so sure that he was constrained to acknowledge its strength if his mother were there in living burial what could he her by the strong hand nothing an army might beat the stony face with ballista and ram and be laughed at against him alone the gigantic southeast turret looked down in the of hill and he thought cunning is so easily bafﬂed and god always the last resort of the is sometimes so slow to act in doubt and misgiving he turned into the street in front of the tower and followed it slowly on to the west over in bezetha he knew there was khan where it was his intention to seek lodging while in the city but just now he could not resist the impulse to go home his heart drew him that way the old formal salutation which he received from the few people who passed him had never sounded so pleasantly presently all the eastern sky began to silver and shine and objects before invisible in the the tall towers on mount emer ged from shadowy depth and put on spectral distinctness ﬂoating it were above the yawning blackness of the valley below very castles in

valves was the board with the this is the property of the project gutenberg https had gone in or out the gate since the dreadful day of the separation should he knock of old it was useless he knew yet he could not resist the temptation amrah might hear and look out of one of the windows on that side taking stone he mounted the broad stone step and tapped three times dull echo replied he tried again louder than before and again pausing each time to listen the silence was mocking retiring into the street he watched the windows but they too were lifeless the parapet on the roof was deﬁned sharply against the brightening sky nothing could have stirred upon it unseen by him and nothing did stir from the north side he passed to the west where there were four windows which he watched long and anxiously but with little effect at times his heart swelled with impotent wishes at others he trembled at the deceptions of his own fancy amrah made even ghost stirred silently then he stole round to the south there too the gate was sealed and inscribed the mellow splendor of the august moon pouring over the crest of olivet since termed the mount of offence brought the lettering boldly out and he read and was ﬁlled with rage all he could was to wrench the board from its nailing and hurl it into the ditch then he sat upon the step and prayed the new king and that his coming might be hastened his blood cooled insensibly he yielded to the fatigue of long travel in the summer heat and sank down lower and at last slept about that time two women came down the street from the direction of the tower of antonia approaching the palace of the hurs they advanced stealthily with timid steps pausing often to listen at the corner of the rugged pile one said to the other in low voice this is it tirzah and tirzah after look caught her mother s hand and leaned upon her heavily sobbing but silent let us go on my child because mother hesitated and trembled then with an effort to be calm because when morning comes they will put us out of the gate of the city to tirzah sank almost to the stones ah yes she said between sobs i forgot i had the feeling of going home but we are lepers and have homes we belong to the dead the mother stooped and raised her tenderly saying we have nothing to fear let us go indeed lifting their empty hands they could have run upon legion and put it to ﬂight and creeping in close to the rough wall they glided on like two ghosts till they came to the gate before which they also paused seeing the board they stepped upon the stone in the scarce cold tracks of

the poor are dead he is dead project gutenberg https who mother your brother they took everything from even this house poor said tirzah vacantly he will never be able to help and then mother my child we must ﬁnd seat by the wayside and beg alms the lepers beg tirzah leaned upon her again and said whispering let us die the mother said ﬁrmly the lord has appointed our times and we are believers in the lord we will wait on him even in this come away she caught tirzah s hand she spoke and hastened to the west corner of the house keeping close to the wall one being in sight there they kept on to the next corner and shrank from the moonlight which lay exceedingly bright over the whole south front and along part of the street the mother s will was strong casting one look back and up to the windows on the west side she stepped out into the light drawing tirzah after her and the extent of their afﬂiction was then to be their lips and cheeks in their bleared eyes in their cracked hands especially in the long snaky locks stiff with loathsome ichor and like their eyebrows ghastly white nor was it possible to have told which was mother which daughter both alike seemed old hist said the mother there is some one lying upon the step man let us go round they crossed to the opposite side of the street quickly and in the shade there moved on till before the gate where they stopped he is asleep tirzah the man was very still stay here and i will try the so saying the mother stole noiselessly across and ventured to touch the wicket she never knew if it yielded that moment the man sighed and turning restlessly shifted the handkerchief on his head in such manner that the face was left upturned and fair in the broad moonlight she looked down at it and started then looked again stooping little and arose and clasped her hands and raised her eyes to heaven in mute appeal an instant so and she ran back to tirzah the lord liveth the man is my brother she said in an whisper my brother the mother caught her hand eagerly come she said in the same enforced whisper let us look at him help thou thy servants lord they crossed the street hand in hand when their shadows fell upon him they stopped one of his hands was lying out upon the step palm up tirzah fell upon her knees and would have kissed it but the mother drew her back not thy life not thy life unclean unclean she project

lips were red and the teeth shone white and the soft beard did not hide the full roundness of chin and throat how beautiful he appeared to the mother s eyes how mightily she yearned to put her arms about him and take his head upon her bosom and kiss him had been her wont in his happy childhood where got she the strength to resist the impulse from her love reader mother which if thou wilt observe well hath this unlikeness to any other love tender to the object it can be inﬁnitely tyrannical to itself and thence all its power of not restoration to health and fortune not any blessing of life not life itself would she have left her leprous kiss upon his cheek yet touch him she must in that instant of ﬁnding him she must renounce him forever how bitter bitter hard it was let some other mother say she knelt down and crawling to his feet touched the sole of one of his sandals with her lips yellow though it was with the dust of the touched it again and again and her very soul was in the kisses he stirred and tossed his hand they moved back but heard him mutter in his dream mother amrah where he fell of f into the deep sleep tirzah stared wistfully the mother put her face in the dust struggling to suppress sob so deep and strong it seemed her heart was bursting almost she wished he might waken he had asked her she was not forgotten in his sleep he was thinking of her was it not enough presently mother beckoned to tirzah and they arose and taking one more look if to print his image past fading hand in hand they recrossed the street back in the shade of the wall there they retired and knelt looking at him waiting him to waiting some revelation they knew not what nobody has yet given us measure the patience of love like theirs the sleep being yet upon him another woman appeared at the corner of the palace the two in the shade saw her plainly in the light small ﬁgure much bent haired dressed neatly in servant s garb and carrying basket full of vegetables at sight of the man upon the step the stopped then if decided she walked lightly she drew near the sleeper passing round him she went to the gate slid the wicket latch easily to one side and put her hand in the opening one of the broad boards in the left valve swung ajar without noise she put the basket through and was about to follow when yielding to curiosity she lingered to have one look at the stranger whose face was below her in open view the spectators across the street heard low exclamation and saw the woman rub her eyes if to renew their power bend closer down clasp her hands gaze wildly around look at the sleeper stoop and raise the outlying hand and kiss it which they wished so mightily to but dared not awakened by the action instinctively withdrew the hand he did so his eyes met the woman project gutenberg https amrah amrah is it thou he said the good heart made answer in word s but fell upon his neck crying joy gently he put her arms away and liftin g the dark face wet with tears kissed it his joy only little less than hers then those across the way heard him say amrah tell of them speak speak i pray thee amrah only cried afresh thou has seen them amrah thou knowest where they are tell they are at tirzah moved but her mother divining her purpose caught her and whispered not life unclean unclean her love was in tyrannical mood though both their hearts broke he should not become what they were and she conquered meantime amrah so entreated only wept the more wert thou going in he asked presently seeing the board swung back come then i will go with he arose he spoke the the curse of the lord upon them romans lied the house is mine rise amrah and let us go moment and they were gone leaving the two in the shade to behold the gate staring blankly at gate which they might not ever enter more they nestled together in the dust they had done their duty their love was proven next morning they were found and driven out the city with stones begone ye are of the dead go

stones with which the well is curbed ask its depth smile at the primitive mode of drawing the purling treasure and waste some pity on the ragged wretch who presides over it then facing about they are enraptured with the mounts moriah and zion both of which slope towards them from the north one terminating in ophel the other in what used to be the site of the city of david in the background up far in the sky the garniture of the sacred places is visible here the haram with its graceful dome yonder the stalward remains of hippicus deﬁant even in ruins when that view has been enjoyed and is sufﬁciently impressed upon the memory the travellers glance at the mount of offence standing in rugged stateliness at their right hand and then at the hill of evil counsel over on the left in which if they be well up in scriptural history and in the traditions rabbinical and monkish they will ﬁnd certain interest not to be overcome by superstitious horror it were long to tell all the points of interest grouped around that hill the present purpose enough that its feet are planted in the veritable orthodox hell of the hell of brimstone and the old nomenclature gehenna and that now in the days of christ its bluff face opposite the city on the south and southeast is seamed and pitted with tombs which have been immemorially the of lepers not singly but collectively there they set up their government and established their society there they founded city and dwelt by themselves avoided the accursed of god the second morning after the incidents of the preceding chapter amrah drew near the well and seated herself upon stone one familiar with jerusalem looking at her would have said she was the favorite servant of some family she brought with her water and basket the contents of the latter covered with napkin placing them on the ground at her side she loosened the shawl which fell from her head knit her ﬁngers together in her lap and gazed demurely up to where the hill drops steeply down into aceldama and the potter s field it was very early and she was the ﬁrst to arrive at the well soon however man came bringing rope and leathern bucket saluting the little woman he undid the rope ﬁxed it to the bucket and waited customers others who chose to so might draw water themselves he was professional in the business and would ﬁll the largest jar the stoutest woman could carry gerah amrah sat still and had nothing to say seeing the jar the man asked after while if she wished it ﬁlled she answered him civilly not now whereupon he gave her more attention when project gutenberg https was fairly deﬁned over olivet his patrons began to arrive and he had all he could to attend to them all the time she kept her seat looking intently up at the hill the sun made its appearance yet she sat watching and waiting and while she thus waits let us see what her purpose is her custom had been to go to market after nightfall stealing out unobserved she would seek the shops in the tyropoeon or those over by the fish gate in the east make her purchases of meat and vegetables and return and shut herself up again the pleasure she derived from the presence of in the old house once more may be imagined she had nothing to tell him of her mistress or he would have had her move to place not so lonesome she refused she would have had him take his own room again which was just he had left it but the danger of discovery was too great and he wished above all things to avoid inquiry he would come and see her often possible coming in the night he would also go away in the night she was compelled to be satisﬁed and at once occupied herself contriving ways to make him happy that he was man now did not occur to her nor did it enter her mind that he might have put by or lost his boyish tastes to please him she thought to go on her old round of services he used to be fond of confec tions she remembered the things in that line which delighted him most and resolved to make them and have supply always ready when he came could anything be happier so next night earlier than usual she stole out with her basket and went over to the fish gate market wandering about seeking the best honey she chanced to hear man telling story what the story was the reader can arrive at with sufﬁcient certainty when told that the narrator was one of the men who had held torches the commandant of the tower of antonia when down in cell the hurs were found the particulars of the ﬁnding were all told and she heard them with the names of the prisoners and the widow s account of herself the feelings with which amrah listened to the recital were such became the devoted creature she was she made her purchases and returned home in dream what happiness she had in store her boy she had found his mother she put the basket away now laughing now crying suddenly she stopped and thought it would kill him to be told that his mother and tirzah were lepers he would go through the awful city over on the hill of evil each infected tomb he would go without rest asking them and the disease would catch him and their fate would be his she wrung her hands what should she like many one before her and many one since she derived inspiration if not wisdom from her affection and came to singular conclusion the lepers she knew were accustome d of mornings to come down from their sepulchral abodes in the hill and take supply of water the day from the well bringing their jars they would set them on the ground and wait standing afar until they were ﬁlled to that the mistress and tirzah must come the law was inexorable and admitted distinction rich leper was better than poor project gutenberg https amrah decided not to speak to hur of the story she had heard but go alone to the well and wait hunger and thirst would drive the unfortunates thither and she believed she could recognize them at sight if not they might recognize her meantime came and they talked much malluch would arrive then the search should be immediately begun he was impatient to be about it to amuse himself he would visit the sacred places in the vicinity the secret we may be sure weighed heavily on the woman but she held her peace when he was gone she busied herself in the preparation of things good to eat applying her utmost skill to the work at the approach of day signalled by the stars she ﬁlled the basket selected jar and took the road to going out by the fish gate which was earliest open and arriving we have seen shortly after sunrise when business at the well was most pressing and the drawer of water most hurried when in fact half dozen buckets were in use at the same time everybody making haste to get away before the cool of the morning melted into the heat of the day the tenantry of the hill began to appear and move about the doors of their tombs somewhat later they were discernible in groups of which not few were children so young that they suggested the holiest relation numbers came momentarily around the turn of the with jars upon their shoulders old and very feeble men hobbling along on staffs and crutches some leaned upon the shoulders of others the utterly like heaps of rags upon litters even that community of superlative sorrow had its to make life endurable and attractive distance softened without entirely veiling the misery of the outcasts from her seat by the well amrah kept watch upon the spectral groups she scarcely moved more than once she imagined she saw those she sought that they were there upon the hill she had doubt that they must come down and near she knew when the people at the well were all served they would come now quite at the base of the bluff there was tomb which had more than once attracted amrah by its wide gaping stone of large dimensions stood near its mouth the sun looked into it through the hottest hours of the day and altogether it seemed uninhabitable by anything living unless perchance by some wild dogs returning from scavenger duty down in gehenna thence however and greatly to her surprise the patient egyptian beheld two women come one half supporting half leading the other they were both both looked old but their garments were not rent and they gazed about them if the locality were new the witness below thought she even saw them shrink terriﬁed at the spectacle offered by the hideous assemblage of which they found themselves part slight reasons certainly to make her heart beat faster and draw her attention to them exclusively but so they did the two remained by the stone awhile then they moved slowly painfully and with much fear towards the well whereat several voices were raised to stop them yet they kept on the drawer of water picked up some pebbles and made ready to drive them back the company cursed them the greater company on the hill shouted shrilly unclean unclean project gutenberg https surely thought amrah of the two they kept coming surely they are strangers to the usage of she arose and went to meet them taking the basket and jar the alarm at the well immediately subsided what fool said one laughing what fool to give good bread to the dead in that way and to think of her coming so far said another i would at least make them meet at the amrah with better impulse proceeded if she should be mistaken her heart arose into her throat and the farther she went the more doubtful and confused she became four or ﬁve yards from where they stood waiting her she stopped that the mistress she loved whose hand she had so often kissed in gratitude whose image of matronly loveliness she had treasured in memory so faithfully and that the tirzah she had nursed through babyhood whose pains she had soothed whose sports she had shared that the smiling d songful tirzah the light of the great house the promised blessing of her old age her mistress her the soul of the woman sickened at the sight these are old women she said to herself i never saw them before i will go she turned away amrah said one of the lepers the egyptian dropped the jar and looked back trembling who called she asked the servant s wondering eyes settled upon the speaker s face who are you she cried we are they you are amrah fell upon her knees my mistress my mistress i have made your god my god be he praised that he has led to you and upon her knees the poor overwhelmed creature began moving forward stay amrah come not nearer unclean unclean the words sufﬁced amrah fell upon her face sobbing so loud the people at the well heard her suddenly she arose upon her knees again my mistress where is tirzah here i am amrah here will you not bring little water the habit of the servant renewed itself putting back the coarse hair fallen over her face amrah arose and went to the basket and uncovered it see she said here are bread and she would have spread the napkin upon the ground but the mistress spoke again not so amrah those yonder may stone you and refuse us drink leave the basket with take up the jar and ﬁll it and bring it here we will carry them to the tomb with us this day you will then have rendered all the service that is lawful haste project gutenberg https people under whose eyes all this had passed made way the servant and even helped her ﬁll the jar so piteous was the grief her countenance showed who are they woman asked amrah meekly answered they used to be good to raising the jar upon her shoulder she hurried back in forgetfulness she would have gone to them but the cry unclean unclean beware arrested her placing the water by the basket she stepped back and stood of f little way thank you amrah said the mistress taking the articles into possession this is very good of is there nothing more i can asked amrah the mother s hand was upon the jar and she was fevered with thirst yet she paused and rising said ﬁrmly yes i know that judah has come home i saw him at the gate night before last asleep on the step i saw you wake amrah clasped her hands my mistress you saw it and did not come that would have been to kill him i can never take him in my arms again i can never kiss him more amrah amrah you love him i know yes said the true heart bursting into tears again and kneeling i would die prove to what you say i am ready then you shall not tell him where we are or that you have seen that but he is looking you he has come from afar to ﬁnd he must not ﬁnd us he shall not become what we are hear amrah you shall serve us you have this day you shall bring us the little we long long you shall come every morning and evening thus voice

and come this evening we will look you till then the burden will be heavy my mistress and hard to bear said amrah falling upon her face how much harder would it be to see him we are the mother answered she gave the basket to tirzah come again this evening she repeated taking up the water and starting the tomb amrah waited kneeling until they had disappeared then she took the road sorrowfully home in the evening she returned and thereafter it became her custom to serve them in the morning and evening so that they wanted nothing needful the tomb though ever so stony and desolate

all the particulars of the accident to gratus describing the affair wholly without criminality the object of the quest now he said was if any of the unhappy family were discovered alive to carry petition to the feet of cæsar praying restitution of the estate and return to their civil rights such petition he had doubt would result in an investigation by the imperial order proceeding of which the friends of the family had fear in reply the tribune stated circumstantially the discovery of the women in the tower and permitted reading of the memorandum he had taken of their account of themselves when leave to copy it was prayed he even permitted that malluch thereupon hurried to it were useless to attempt description of the effect the terrible story had upon the young man the pain was not relieved by tears or passionate outcries it was too deep any expression he sat still long time with pallid face and laboring heart now and then if to show the thoughts which were most poignant

to get to the praetorium the romans resonantly styled the palace of herod on mount zion the party had to cross the lowlands north and west of the temple by they may be so north and south with intersections hardly up to the dignity of alleys they passed rapidly round the akra district to the tower of mariamne from which the way was short to the grand gate of the walled heights in going they overtook or were overtaken by people like themselves stirred to wrath by news of the proposed desecration when at length they reached the gate of the praetorium the procession of elders and rabbis had passed in with great following leaving greater crowd clamoring outside centurion kept the entrance with guard drawn up full armed under the beautiful marble battlements the sun struck the soldiers fervidly on helm and shield but they kept their ranks indifferent alike to its dazzle and to the mouthings of the rabble through the open bronze gates current of citizens poured in while much lesser one poured out what is going on one of the galileans asked an outcomer nothing was the reply the rabbis are before the door of the palace asking to see pilate he has refus ed to come out they have sent one to tell him they will not go away till he has heard them they are let us go in said in his quiet way seeing what his companions probably did not that there was not only disagreement between the suitors and the governor but an issue joined and serious question to who should have his will inside the gate there was row of trees in leaf with seats under them the people whether going or coming carefully avoided the shade cast gratefully upon the white pavement project gutenberg https it may seem rabbinical ordinance alleged to have been derived from the law permitted green thing to be grown within the walls of jerusalem even the wise king it was said wanting garden his egyptian bride was constrained to found it down in the of the valleys above through the shone the outer fronts of the palace turning to the right the party proceeded short distance to spacious square on the west side of which stood the residence of the governor an excited multitude ﬁlled the square every face was directed towards portico built over broad doorway which was closed under the portico there was another array of legionaries the throng was so close the friends could not well have advanced if such had been their desire they remained therefore in the rear observers of what was going on about the portico they could see the high turbans of the rabbis whose impatience communicated at times to the mass behind them cry was frequent to the effect pilate if thou be governor come forth come forth once man coming out pushed through the crowd his face red with anger israel is of account here he said in loud voice on this holy ground we are better than dogs of will he not come out think you come has he not thrice refused what will the rabbis at here till he gives them ear he will not dare touch the treasure will he asked one of the galileans who can say did not roman profane the holy of holies is there anything sacred from romans an hour passed and though pilate deigned them answer the rabbis and crowd remained noon came bringing shower from the west but change in the situation except that the multitude was larger and much noisier and the feeling more decidedly angry the shouting was almost continuous come forth come forth the cry was sometimes with disrespectful variations meanwhile hur held his galilean friends together he judged the pride of the roman would eventually get the better of his discretion and that the end could not be far off pilate was but waiting the people to furnish him an excuse resort to violence and at last the end came in the midst of the assemblage there was heard the sound of blows succeeded instantly by yells of pain and rage and most furious commotion the venerable men in front of the portico faced about aghast the common people in the rear at ﬁrst pushed forward in the centr the effort was to get out and short time the pressure of opposing forces was terrible thousand voices made inquiry raised all at once one had time to answer the surprise speedily became panic kept his senses you can not see he said to one of the galileans i will raise you he caught the man about the middle and lifted him bodily project gutenberg https what is it i see now said the man there are some armed with clubs and they are beating the people they are dressed like who are they romans the lord liveth romans in disguise their clubs ﬂy like ﬂails there i saw rabbi struck old man they spare nobody let the man down men of galilee he said it is trick of pilate now will you what i say we will get even with the the galilean spirit arose yes yes they answered let us go back to the trees by the gate and we may ﬁnd the planting of herod though unlawful has some good in it after all come they ran back all of them fast they could and by throwing their united weight upon the limbs tore them from the trunks in brief time they too were armed returning at the corner of the square they met the crowd rushing madly the gate behind the clamor medley of shrieks groans and execrations to the wall shouted to the wall let the herd go by so clinging to the masonry at their right hand they escaped the might of the rush and little by little made headway until at last the square was reached keep together now and follow by this time s leadership was perfect and he pushed into the seething mob his party closed after him in body and when the romans clubbing the people and making merry they struck them down came hand to hand with the galileans lithe of limb eager the fray and equally armed they were in turn surprised then the shouting was close and ﬁerce the crash of sticks rapid and deadly the advance furious hate could make it one performed his part well whose training served him admirably not merely he knew to strike and guard his long arm perfect action and incomparable strength helped him also to success in every encounter he was at the same time and leader the club he wielded was of goodly length and weighty so he had need to strike man but once he seemed moreover to have eyes each combat of his friends and the faculty of being at the right moment exactly where he was most needed in his ﬁghting cry there were inspiration his party and alarm his enemies thus surprised and equally matched the romans at ﬁrst retired but ﬁnally turned their backs and ﬂed to the portico the impetuous galileans would have pursued them to the steps but wisely restrained them stay my men he said the centurion yonder is coming with the guard they have swords and shields we can not ﬁght them we have done well let us get back and out of the gate while we may they obeyed him though slowly they had frequently to step over their countrymen lying where they had been felled some writhing and groaning some praying help others mute the dead but the fallen were not all jews in that there was project gutenberg https centurion shouted to them they went off laughed at him and replied in his own tongue if we are dogs of israel you are jackals of rome remain here and we will come the galileans cheered and laughing went on outside the gate there was multitude the like of which hur had never seen not even in the circus at antioch the tops the streets the slope of the hill appeared densely covered with people wailing and praying the air was ﬁlled with their cries and imprecations the party were permitted to pass without challenge by the outer guard but hardly were they out before the centurion in charge at the portico appeared and in the gateway called to ho insolent art thou roman or jew answered i am son of judah born here what wouldst thou with stay and singly thou wilt laughed derisively brave roman worthy son of the bastard roman jove i have thou shalt have mine the centurion answered i will borrow of the guard the people in hearing of the colloquy became silent and from them the hush spread afar but lately had beaten roman under the eyes of antioch and the farth er east now could he beat another one under the eyes of jerusalem the honor might be vastly proﬁtable to the cause of the new king he did not hesitate going frankly to the centurion he said i am willing lend thy sword and and the helm and breastplate asked the roman keep them they might not ﬁt the arms were frankly delivered and directly the centurion was ready all this time the soldiers in rank close by the gate never moved they simply listened to the multitude only when the combatants advanced to begin the ﬁght the question sped from mouth to mouth who is he and one knew now the roman supremacy in arms lay in three submission to discipline the legionary formation of battle and peculiar use of the short sword in combat they never struck or cut from ﬁrst to last they advanced thrusting they retired thrusting and generally their aim was at the foeman s face all this was well known to they were about to engage he said i told thee i was son of judah but i did not tell that i am defend thyself at the last word closed with his antagonist moment standing foot to foot they glared at each other over the rims of their embossed shields then the roman pushed forward and feinted an under the jew laughed at him thrust at the face followed the jew stepped lightly to the left quick the thrust was the step was quicker under the lifted arm of the foe he slid his shield advancing it until the sword and project gutenberg https caught on its upper surface another step this time forward and left and the man s whole right side was offered to the point the centurion fell heavily on his breast clanging the pavement and had won with his foot upon his enemy s back he raised his shield overhead after gladiatorial custom and saluted the imperturbable soldiers by the gate when the people realized the victory they behaved like mad on the houses far the xystus fast the word could ﬂy they waved their shawls and handkerchiefs and shouted and if he had consented the galileans would have carried off upon their shoulders to petty ofﬁcer who then advanced from the gate he said thy comrade died like soldier i leave him undespoiled only his sword and shield are with that he walked away off little he spoke to the galileans brethren you have behaved well let us now separate lest we be pursued meet at the khan in bethany i have something to propose to you of great interest to who are you they asked him son of judah he answered simply throng eager to see him sur ged around the party will you come to bethany he asked yes we will then bring with you this sword and shield that i may know pushing brusquely through the increasing crowd he speedily disappeared at the instance of pilate the people went up from the city and carried off their dead and wounded and there was much mourning them but the grief was greatly lightened by the victory of the unknown champion who was everywhere sought and by every one extolled the fainting spirit of the nation was revived by the brave deed insomuch that in the streets and up in the temple even amidst the solemnities of the feast old tales of the maccabees were told again and thousands shook their heads whispering wisely little longer only little longer brethren and israel will come to her own let there be faith in the lord and in such manner obtained hold on galilee and paved the way to greater services in the cause of the king who was coming and with what result we shall project gutenberg https seventh and waking i beheld her there in the moted air siren lithe and debonair with wristlets woven of scarlet weeds and oblong lucent amber beads of shining in her thomas bailey project gutenberg https i the meeting took place in the khan of bethany appointed thence went with the galileans into their country where his exploits up in the old gave him fame and inﬂuence before the winter was gone he raised three legions and organized them after the roman pattern he could have had many more the martial spirit of that gallant people never slept the proceeding however required careful guarding against both rome and herod antipas contenting himself the present with the three he strove to train and educate them systematic action that purpose he carried the ofﬁcers over into the beds of trachonitis and taught them the use of arms particularly the javelin and sword and the manoeuvering peculiar to the legionary formation after which he sent them home teachers and soon the training became pastime of the people may be thought the task called patience skill zeal faith and devotion on his into which the power of inspiring others in matters of difﬁculty is always resolvable and never man possessed them in greater degree or used them to better effect how he labored and with utter denial of self yet withal he would have failed but the support he had from simonides who furnished him arms and money and from ilderim who kept watch and brought him supplies and still he would have failed but the genius of the galileans under that name were comprehended the four zebulon issachar and the districts originally set apart to them the jew born in sight of the temple despised these brethren of the north but the talmud itself has said the galilean loves honor and the jew money hating rome fervidly they loved their own country in every revolt they were ﬁrst in the ﬁeld and last to leave it one hundred and ﬁfty thousand galilean youths perished in the ﬁnal war with rome the great festal days they went up to jerusalem marching and camping like armies yet they were liberal in sentiment and even tolerant to heathenism in herod s beautiful cities which were roman in all things in sepphoris and tiberias especially they took pride and in the building them gave loyal support they had men from the outside world everywhere and lived in peace with them to the glory of the hebrew name they contributed poets like the singer of the song of songs and prophets like hosea upon such people so quick so proud so brave so devoted so imaginative tale like that of the coming of the king was powerful that he was coming to put rome down would have been sufﬁcient to enlist them in the scheme proposed by but when besides they were assured he was to rule the world more mighty than cæsar more magniﬁcent than solomon and that the rule was to last forever the appeal was irresistible and they vowed themselves to the cause body and soul they asked his authority the sayings and he quoted the prophets and told them of balthasar in waiting over in antioch and they project gutenberg https it was the old legend of the messiah familiar to them almost the name of the lord the cherished dream with time ﬁxed its realization the king was not merely coming now he was at hand so with the winter months rolled by and spring came with gladdening showers blown over from the summering sea in the west and by that time so earnestly and successfully had he toiled that he could say to himself and his followers let the good king come he has only to tell us where he will have his throne set up we have the to keep it and in all his dealings with the many men they knew him only son of judah and by that name one evening over in trachonitis was sitting with some of his galileans at the mouth of the cave in which he quartered when an arab courier rode to him and delivered letter breaking the package he read jerusalem nisan iv prophet has appeared who men say is elias he has been in the wilderness years and to our eyes he is prophet and such also is his speech the burden of which is of one much greater than himself who he says is to come presently and whom he is now waiting on the eastern shore of the river jordan i have been to see and hear him and the one he is waiting is certainly the king you are awaiting come and judge yourself all jerusalem is going out to the prophet and with many people else the shore on which he abides is like mount olivet in the last days of the passover s face ﬂushed with joy by this word my friends he by this word our waiting is at end the herald of the king has appeared and announced upon hearing the letter read they also rejoiced at the promise it held out get ready now he added and in the morning set your faces homeward when arrived there send word to those under you and bid them be ready to assemble i may direct myself and you i will go see if the king be indeed at hand and send you report let us in the meantime live in the pleasure of the going into the cave he addressed letter to ilderim and another to simonides giving notice of the news received and of his purpose to go up immediately to jerusalem the letters he despatched by swift messengers when night fell and the stars of direction came out he mounted and with an arab guide set out the jordan intending to strike the track of the caravans between and damascus the guide was sure and aldebaran swift so by midnight the two were out of the lava fastness speeding project gutenberg https ii it was s purpose to turn aside at the break of day and ﬁnd safe place in which to rest but the dawn overtook him while out in the desert and he kept on the guide promising to bring him afterwhile to vale shut in by great rocks where there were spring some and herbage in plenty the horses he rode thinking of the wondrous events so soon to happen and of the changes they were to bring about in the affairs of men and nations the guide ever on the alert called attention to an appearance of strangers behind them everywhere around the desert stretched away in waves of sand slowly yellowing in the growing light and without any green thing visible over on the left but still far off range of low moun tains extended apparently interminable in the vacancy of such waste an object in motion could not long continue mystery it is camel with riders the guide said directly are there others behind said it is alone there is man on driver probably little later himself could see the camel was white and unusually large reminding him of the wonderful animal he had seen bring balthasar and iras to the fountain in the grove of daphne there could be other like it thinking then of the fair egyptian insensibly his gait became slower and at length fell into the merest loiter until ﬁnally he could discern curtained houdah and two persons seated within it if they were balthasar and iras should he make himself known to them but it could not be this was the they were alone but while he debated the question the long swinging stride of the camel brought its riders up to him he heard the ringing of the tiny bells and beheld the rich housings which had been so attractive to the crowd at the castalian fount he beheld also the ethiopian always attendant upon the egyptians the tall brute stopped close by his horse and looking up lo iras herself under the raised curtain looking down at him her great swimming eyes bright with astonishment and inquiry the blessing of the true god upon you said balthasar in his tremulous voice and to thee and thine be the peace of the lord replied my eyes are weak with years said balthasar but they approve you that son of hur whom lately i knew an honored guest in the tent of ilderim the and thou art that balthasar the wise egyptian whose speech concerning certain holy things in expect ation is having so much to with the ﬁnding in this waste place what dost thou here he is never alone who is where god god is everywhere balthasar answered gravely but in the sense of your asking there is caravan short way behind us going to alexandria and it is to pass through jerusalem i thought best project gutenberg https myself of its company far the holy city whither i am journeying this morning however in discontent with its slow because of roman cohort in attendance upon rose early and ventured thus far in

wilderness extends and the lion shall be swift that overtakes this king of his he patted the neck of the camel he spoke yet said iras with smile which was not lost upon the youth whose eyes it must be admitted had several times turned to her during the interchange of speeches with the y et even he would be better if his fast were broken kings have hunger and headaches if you be indeed the of whom my father has spoken and whom it was my pleasure to have known well you will be happy i am sure to show us some near path to living water that with its sparkle we may grace morning s meal in the nothing loath hastened to answer fair egyptian i give you sympathy can you bear suffering little longer we will ﬁnd the spring you ask and i promise that its draught shall be sweet and cooling that of the more famous castalia with leave we will make i give you the blessing of the thirsty she replied and offer you in return bit of bread from the city ovens dipped in fresh butter from the dewy meadows of most rare favor let us go so saying rode forward with the guide one of the inconveniences of travelling with camels being that it is necessarily an interdiction of polite conversation afterwhile the party came to shallow wady down which turning to the right hand the guide led them the bed of the cut was somewhat soft from recent rains and quite bold in its descent momentarily however it widened and erelong the sides became bluffs ribbed with rocks much scarred by ﬂoods rushing to lower depths ahead finally from narrow passage the travellers entered spreading vale which was very delightful but come upon suddenly from the yellow unrelieved verdureless plain it had the effect of freshly discovered paradise the water winding here and there deﬁnable by crisp white shingling appeared like threads tangled among islands green with grasses and fringed with reeds up from the ﬁnal depths of the valley of the jordan some venturous oleanders had crept and with their large bloom now starred the sunken place one arose in royal assertion the bases of the were cloaked with clambering vines and under leaning cliff over on the left the mulberry grove had planted itself proclaiming the spring which the party were seeking and thither the guide conducted them careless of whistling partridges and lesser birds of brighter hues roused whirring from the reedy coverts the water started from crack in the cliff which some loving hand had enlar ged into an arched cavity graven over it in bold hebraic letters was the word god the graver had doubt drunk there and tarried many days and given thanks in that durable form from the arch the stream ran merr ily over ﬂag spotted project gutenberg https moss and leaped into pool glassy clear thence it stole away between grassy banks nursing the trees before it vanished in the thirsty sand few narrow paths were noticeable about the margin of the pool otherwise the space around was untrodden turf at sight of which the guide was assured of rest free from intrusion by men the horses were presently turned loose and from the kneeling camel the ethiopian assisted balthasar and iras whereupon the old man turning his face to the east crossed his hands reverently upon his breast and prayed bring cup iras said with some impatience from the houdah the slave brought her crystal goblet then she said to i will be your servant at the they walked to the pool together he would have dipped the water her but she refused his offer and kneeling held the cup to be ﬁlled by the stream itself nor yet content when it was cooled and overrunning she tendered him the ﬁrst draught he said putting the graceful hand aside and seeing only the large eyes half hidden beneath the arches of the upraised brows be the service mine i pray she persisted in having her way in my country son of hur we have saying better cupbearer to the fortunate than minister to fortunate he said there were both surprise and inquiry in the tone of his voice and in his look and she said quickly the gods give us success sign by which we may know them on our side were you not winner in the circus his cheeks began to ﬂush that was one sign there is another in combat with swords you slew the ﬂush so much the triumphs themselves the ﬂattery there was in the thought that she had followed his career with interest moment and the pleasure was succeeded by reﬂection the combat he knew was matter of report throughout the east but the name of the victor had been committed to very ilderim and simonides could they have made conﬁdante of the woman so with wonder and gratiﬁcation he was confused and seeing it she arose and said holding the cup over the pool gods of egypt i give thanks hero that the victim in the palace of idernee was not my king of men and so holy gods i pour and part of the contents of the cup she returned to the stream the rest she drank when she took the crystal from her lips she laughed at him son of hur is it fashion of the very brave to be so easily overcome by woman take the cup now and see if you can not ﬁnd happy word in it he took the cup and stooped to reﬁll it son of israel has gods whom he can libate he said playing with the water to hide his amazement now greater than before what more did the egyptian know about him had she been told of his relations with simonides and there was the project gutenberg https she knowledge of that also he was struck with mistrust somebody had betrayed his secrets and they were serious and besides he was going to jerusalem just then of all the world the place where such intelligence possessed by an enemy might be most dangerous to him his associates and the cause but was she an enemy it is well us that while writing is slow thought is instantaneous when the cup was fairly cooled he ﬁlled it and arose saying with indif ference well af fected most fair were i an egyptian or greek or roman i would say raised the goblet overhead he ye better gods i give thanks that there are yet left to the world despite its wrongs and sufferings the charm of beauty and the solace of love and i drink to her who best represents iras loveliest of the daughters of the nile she laid her hand softly upon his shoulder you have offended against the law the gods you have drunk to are false gods why shall i not tell the rabbis on you oh he replied laughing that is very little to tell one who knows so much else that is really i will go will go to the little jewess who makes the roses grow and the shadows ﬂame in the house of the great merchant over in antioch to the rabbis i will accuse you of impenitence to well to her i will repeat what you have said to under the lifted cup with the gods he was still moment if waiting the egyptian to go on with quickened fancy he saw esther at her father s side listening to the despatches he had reading them in her presence he had told simonides the story of the affair in the palace of idernee she and iras were acquainted this one was shrewd and worldly the other was simple and affectionate and therefore easily won simonides could not have broken if not held by honor there was one unless it might be himself to whom the consequences of exposure were more serious and certain could esther have been the egyptian s informant he did not accuse her yet suspicion was sown with the thought and suspicions we all know are weeds of the mind which grow of themselves and most rapidly when least wanted before he could answer the allusion to the little jewess balthasar came to the pool we are greatly indebted to you son of hur he said in his grave manner this vale is very beautiful the grass the trees the shade invite us to stay and rest and the spring here has the sparkle of diamonds in motion and sings to of loving god it is not enough to thank you the enjoyment we ﬁnd come sit with us and taste our suffer ﬁrst to serve with that ﬁlled the goblet and gave it to balthasar who lifted his eyes in thanksgiving immediately the slave brought napkins and after laving their hands and drying them the three seated themselves in eastern style under the tent which years before had served the wise men at the meeting in the desert and they ate heartily of the good things taken from the camel s project gutenberg https iii the tent was cosily pitched beneath tree where the gurgle of the stream was constantly in ear overhead the broad leaves hung motionless on their stems the delicate off in the pearly haze stood up occasionally bee shot humming athwart the shade and partridge creeping from the sedge drank whistled to his mate and ran away the restfulness of the vale the freshness of the air the garden beauty the sabbath stillness seemed to have affected the spirits of the elder egyptian his voice gestures and whole manner were unusually gentle and often he bent his eyes upon conversing with iras they softened with pity when we overtook you son of hur he said at the conclusion of the repast it seemed your face was also turned towards jerusalem may i ask without of fence if you are going so far i am going to the holy city the great need i have to spare myself prolonged toil i will further ask you is there shorter road than that by ammon rougher route but shorter lies by gerasa and gilead it is the one i design i am impatient said balthasar latterly my sleep has been visited by rather by the same dream in repetition is nothing and tells he whom thou hast so long awaited is at you mean he that is to be king of the jews asked gazing at the egyptian in wonder even then you have heard nothing of him nothing except the words of the voice in the here then are tidings to make you glad they made from his gown drew the letter received from malluch the hand the egyptian held out trembled violently he read aloud and he read his feelings increased the limp veins in his neck swelled and throbbed at the conclusion he raised his suffused eyes in thanksgiving and prayer he asked questions yet had doubts thou hast been very good to god he said give i pray thee to see the saviour again and worship him and thy servant will be ready to go in the words the manner the singular personality of the simple prayer touched with sensat ion new and abiding god never seemed so actual and so near by it was if he were there bending over them or sitting at their friend whose favors were to be had by the most unceremonious father to whom all his children were alike in not more of the jew than of the universal father who needed intermediates rabbis priests teachers the idea that such god might send mankind saviour instead of king appeared project gutenberg https in light not merely new but so plain that he could almost discern both the greater want of such gift and its greater consistency with the nature of such deity so he could not resist asking now that he has come balthasar you still think he is to be saviour and not king balthasar gave him look thoughtful it was tender how shall i understand you he asked in return the spirit which was the star that was my guide of old has not appeared to since i met you in the tent of the good sheik that is to say i have not seen or heard it formerly i believe the voice that spoke to in my dreams was it but other than that i have i will recall the difference between us said with deference you were of opinion that he would be king but not cæsar is you thought his sovereignty would be spiritual not of the oh yes the egyptian answered and i am of the same opinion now i see the diver gence in our faith you are going to meet king of men i saviour of he paused with the look often seen when people are struggling with introverted effort to disentangle thought which is either too high quick discernment or too subtle simple expression let try son of hur he said directly and help you to clear understanding of my belief then it may be seeing how the spiritual kingdom i expect him to set up can be more excellent in every sense than anything of mere cæsarean splendor you will better understand the reason of the interest i take in the mysterious person we are going to welcome i can not tell you when the idea of soul in every man had its origin most likely the ﬁrst parents brought it with them out of the garden in which they had their ﬁrst dwelling we all know however that it has never perished entirely out of mind by some peoples it was lost but not by all in some ages it dulled and faded in others it was overwhelmed with doubts but in great goodness god kept sending us at intervals mighty intellects to argue it back to faith and hope why should there be soul in every man look son of hur one moment look at the necessity of such device to lie down and die and be more never was when man wished such an end nor has the man ever been who did not in his heart promise himself something better the monuments of the nations are all protests against nothingness after death so are statues and inscriptions so is history the greatest of our egyptian kings had his efﬁgy of hill of solid rock day after day he went with host in chariots to see the work at last it was ﬁnished never efﬁgy so grand so enduring it looked like features were his faithful even in expression now may we not think of him saying in that moment of pride let death come there is an he had his wish the statue is there yet but what is the he thus secured only recollection by glory unsubstantial moonshine on the brow of the great bust story in more meantime what has become of the king there is an embalmed body up in the royal tombs which once was efﬁgy not so fair to look at project gutenberg https out in the desert but where son of hur where is the king himself is he fallen into nothingness two thousand years have gone since he was man alive you and i are was his last breath the end of him to say yes would be to accuse god let us rather accept his better plan of attaining life after death life i the something more than place in mort al memory life with going and coming with sensation with knowledge with power and all appreciation life eternal in term though it may be with changes of condition ask you what god s plan is the gift of soul to each of us at birth with this simple shall be immortality except through the soul in that law see the necessity of which i spoke let us turn from the necessity now word to the pleasure there is in the thought of soul in each of us in the ﬁrst place it robs death of its terrors by making dying change the better and burial but the planting of seed from which there will spring new life in the next place behold i weary old shrunken in body and graceless look at my wrinkled face think of my failing senses listen to my shrilled voice ah what happiness to in the promise that when the tomb opens soon it will to receive the husk i call myself the now viewless doors of the universe which is but the palace of god will swing wide ajar to receive liberated immortal soul i would i could tell the ecstasy there must be in that life to come not say i know nothing about it this much i know and it is enough being soul implies conditions of divine superiority in such being there is dust nor any gross thing it must be ﬁner than air more impalpable than light purer than is life in absolute purity what now son of hur knowing so much shall i dispute with myself or you about the the form of my soul or where it is to abide or whether it eats and drinks or is winged or wears this or that it is more becoming to trust in god the beautiful in this world is all from his hand declaring the perfection of taste he is the author of all form he clothes the lily he colors the rose he distils the he makes the music of nature in word he organized us this life and imposed its conditions and they are such guaranty to that trustful little child i leave to him the organization of my soul and every arrangement the life after death i know he loves the good man stopped and drank and the hand carrying the cup to his lips trembled and both iras and shared his emotion and remained silent upon the latter light was breaking he was beginning to see never before that there might be spiritual kingdom of more import to men than any earthly empire and that after all saviour would indeed be more godly gift than the greatest king i might ask you now said balthasar continuing whether this human life so troubled and brief is preferable to the perfect and everlasting life designed the soul but take the question and think of it yourself formulating thus supposing both to be equally happy is one hour more desirable than one year from that then advance to the ﬁnal inquiry what are threescore and ten years on earth to all eternity with god son of hur thinking in such manner you will be ﬁlled with the meaning of the fact project gutenberg https you next to the most amazing of all events and in its effects the most sorrowful it is that the very idea of life soul is light almost gone out in the world here and there to be sure philosopher may be found who will talk to you of soul likening it to principle but because philosophers take nothing upon faith they will not go the length of admitting soul to be being and on that account its purpose is compressed darkness to them everything animate has mind meas urable by its wants is there to you meaning in the singularity that power in full degree to speculate upon the future was given to man alone by the sign i see it god meant to make us know ourselves created another and better life such being in fact the greatest need of our nature but alas into what habit the nations have fallen they live the day if the present were the all in all and go about saying there is after death or if there be since we know nothing about it be it care unto so when death calls them come they may not enter into enjoyment of the glorious because of their unﬁtness that is to say the ultimate happiness of man was everlasting life in the society of god alas son of hur that i should say it but well yon sleeping camel constant in such society the holiest priests this day serving the highest altars in the most renowned temples so much are men given to this lower earthly life so nearly have they forgotten that other which is to come see now i pray you that which is to be saved to us my part speaking with the holiness of truth i would not

out arose while the slave restored the tent and wares to the box under the houdah and the arab brought up the horses the three principals laved themselves in the pool in little while they were retracing their steps back through the wady intending to overtake the caravan if it had passed them by project gutenberg https iv the caravan stretched out upon the desert was very picturesque in motion however it was like lazy serpent its stubborn dragging became intolerably irksome to balthasar patient he was so at his suggestion the party determined to go on by themselves if the reader be young or if he has yet sympathetic recollection of the romanticisms of his youth he will relish the pleasure with which riding near the camel of the egyptians gave last look at the head of the straggling column almost out of sight on the shimmering plain to be deﬁnite may be and perfectl y conﬁdential found certain charm in iras s presence if she looked down upon him from her high place he made haste to get near her if she spoke to him his heart beat out of its usual time the desire to be agreeable to her was constant impulse objects on the way though ever so common became interes ting the moment she called attention to them black swallow in the air pursued by her pointing ﬁnger went off in halo if bit of quartz or ﬂake of mica was seen to sparkle in the drab sand under kissing of the sun at word he turned aside and brought it to her and if she threw it away in disappointment far from think ing of the trouble he had been put to he was sorry it proved so worthless and kept lookout something ruby perchance diamond so the purple of the far mountains became intensely deep and rich if she distinguished it with an exclamation of praise and when now and then the curtain of the houdah fell down it seemed sudden dulness had dropped from the sky bedraggling all the landscape thus disposed yielding to the sweet inﬂuence what shall save him from the dangers there are in days of the close companionship with the fair egyptian incident to the solitary journey they were entered upon that there is logic in love nor the least mathematical element it is simply natural that she shall fashion the result who has the wielding of the inﬂuence to quicken the conclusion there were signs too that she well knew the inﬂuence she was exercising over him from some place under hand she had since morning drawn caul of golden coins and adjusted it so the gleaming strings fell over her forehead and upon her cheeks blending lustrously with the ﬂowing of her black hair from the same safe deposit she had also produced articles of ﬁnger and ear bracelets necklace of shawl embroidered with threads of ﬁne the effect of all which she softened with scarf of indian lace skillfully folded about her throat and shoulders and so arrayed she plied with countless coquetries of speech and manner showering him with smiles laughing in tremolo all the while following him with glances now tender now by such play antony was weaned from his glory yet she who wrought his ruin was really not half so beautiful this her project gutenberg https so to them the nooning came and the evening the sun at its going down behind spur of the old bashan left the party halted by pool of clear water of the rains out in the abilene desert there the tent was pitched the supper eaten and preparations made the night the second watch was s and he was standing spear in hand within of the dozing camel looking awhile at the stars then over the veiled land the stillness was intense only after long spells warm breath of wind would sough past but without disturbing him yet in thought he entertained the egyptian recounting her charms and sometimes debating how she came by his secrets the uses she might make of them and the course he should pursue with her and through all the debate love stood off but little strong temptation the stronger of gleam of policy behind at the very moment he was most inclined to yield to the allurement hand very fair even in the moonless gloaming was laid softly upon his shoulder the touch thrilled him he started she was there i thought you asleep he said presently sleep is old people and little children and i came out to look at my friends the stars in the now holding the curtains of midnight over the nile but confess yourself surprised he took the hand which had fallen from his shoulder and said well was it by an enemy oh to be an enemy is to hate and hating is sickness which isis will not suffer to come near she kissed you should know on the heart when i was your speech does not sound in the least like your father s are you not of his faith i might have been she laughed i might have been had i seen what he has i may be when i get old like him there should be religion youth only poetry and philosophy and poetry except such is the inspiration of wine and mirth and love and philosophy that does not nod excuse follies which can not outlive season my father s god is too awful i failed to ﬁnd him in the grove of daphne he was never heard of present in the atria of rome but son of hur i have wish where is he who could say it i will try tell it it is very simple i wish to help she drew closer she spoke he laughed and replied lightly egypt came near saying dear egypt not the sphinx abide in your country well you are one of its riddles be merciful and give little clew to help understand you in what i need help and how can you help she took her hand from him and turnin g to the camel spoke to it endearingly and patted its monstrous head it were thing of beauty thou last and swiftest and stateliest of the herds of job sometimes thou too goest stumbling because the way is project gutenberg https stony and the burden grievous how is it thou knowest the kind intent by word and always makest answer gratefully though the help offered is from woman i will kiss thee thou royal brute stooped and touched its broad forehead with her lips saying immediately because in thy intelligence there is suspicion and restraining himself said calmly the reproach has not failed its mark egypt i seem to say thee may it not be because i am under seal of honor and by my silence cover the lives and fortunes of others may be she said quickly it is he shrank step and asked his voice sharp with amazement what all knowest thou she answered after laugh why men deny that the senses of women are sharper than theirs your face has been under my eyes all day i had but to look at it to see you bore some weight in mind and to ﬁnd the weight what had i to more than recall your debates with my father son of hur lowered her voice with singular dexterity and going nearer spoke so her breath was warm upon his son of hur he thou art going to ﬁnd is to be king of the jews is he not his heart beat fast and hard king of the jews like herod only greater she continued he looked the night up to the stars then his eyes met hers and lingered there and her breath was on his lips so near was she since morning she said further we have been having visions now if i tell you mine will you serve well what silent still she pushed his hand away and turned if to go but he caught her and said eagerly and speak she went back and with her hand upon his shoulder leaned against him and he put his arm aroun d her and drew her close very close and in the caress was the promise she asked speak and tell thy visions egypt dear egypt prophet not the tishbite not even the have refused an asking of thine i am at thy will be i pray the entreaty passed apparently unheard looking up and nestling in his embrace she said slowly the vision which followed was of magniﬁcent ar on land and clashing of arms and rush of armies if cæsar and pompey were come again and octavius and antony cloud of dust and ashes arose and covered the world and rome was not any more all dominion returned to the east out of the cloud issued another race of heroes and there were vaster satrapies and brighter crowns giving away than were ever known and son of hur while the vision was passing and after it was gone i kept asking myself what shall he not have who served the king earliest and best again recoiled the question was the very question which had been with him all day presently he fancied he had the clew he project gutenberg https so he said i have you now the satrapies and crowns are the things to which you would help i see i see and there never was such queen you would be so shrewd so beautiful so royal but alas dear egypt by the vision you show it the prizes are all of war and you are but woman though isis did kiss you on the heart and crowns are starry gifts beyond your power of help unless indeed you have way to them more certain than that of the sword if so egypt egypt show it and i will walk in it if only your she removed his arm and said spread your cloak upon the so i can rest against the camel i will sit and tell you story which came down the nile to alexandria where i had he did she said ﬁrst planting the spear in the ground near by and what shall i he said ruefully when she was seated in alexandria is it customary the listeners to sit or stand from the comfortable place against the old domestic she answered laughing the audiences of are wilful and sometimes they they without more ado he stretched himself upon the sand and put her arm about his neck i am ready he said and directly she began how the beautiful came to the ear th you must know in the ﬁrst place that isis that matter she may yet most beautiful of deities and osiris her husband though wise and powerful was sometimes stung with jealousy of her only in their loves are the gods like mortals the palace of the divine wife was of silver crowning the tallest mountain in the moon and thence she passed often to the sun in the heart of which source of eternal light osiris kept his palace of gold too shining men to look at one are days with the she was full pleasantly with him on the roof of the golden palace she chanced to look and afar just on the line of the universe saw indra passing with an army of simians all borne upon the backs of ﬂying eagles he the friend of living with much love is indra returning from his ﬁnal war with the hideous victorious and in his suite were rama the hero and sita his bride who next to isis herself was the very most beautiful and isis arose and took off her girdle of stars and waved it to sita mind it in glad salute and instantly between the marching host and the two on the golden roof something of night fell and shut out the view but it was not the frown of osiris it happened the subject of his speech that moment was such none else than they could think of and he arose and said majestically get thee home i will the work myself to make perfectly happy being i not need thy help get thee now isis had eyes large those of the white cow which in the temple eats sweet grasses from the hands of the faithful even while they say their prayers and her eyes were the color of the cows and quite tender and she too arose and said smiling she spoke so her look was little more than the glow of the moon in the hazy farewell good my lord you will call presently i know without you can not make the project gutenberg https creature of which you were thinking any more she stopped to laugh knowing well the truth of the any more my lord than you yourself can be perfectly happy without we will see he said and she went her way and took her needles and her chair and on the roof of the silver palace sat watching and knitting and the will of osiris at labor in his mighty breast was the sound of the mills of all the other gods grinding at once so loud that the near stars rattled like seeds in parched pod and some dropped out and were lost and while the sound kept on she waited and knit nor lost she ever stitch the while soon spot appeared in the space over towards the sun and it grew until it was great the moon and then she knew world was intended but when growing and growing at last it cast her planet in the shade all save the little point lighted by her presence she knew how very angry he was yet she knit away assured that the end would be she had said and so came the earth at ﬁrst but cold gray mass hanging listless in the hollow void later she saw it separate into divisions here plain there mountain yonder sea all yet without sparkle and then by something moved and she stopped her knitting wonder the something arose and lifted its hands to the sun in sign of knowledge whence it had its being and this first man was beautiful to see and about him were the creations we call grass the trees birds beasts even the insects and reptiles and time the man went about happy in his life it was easy to see how happy he was and in the lull of the sound of the laboring will isis heard scornful laugh and presently the words blown across from the sun thy help indeed behold creature perfectly happy and isis fell to knitting again she was patient osiris was strong and if he could work she could wait and wait she did knowing that mere life is not enough to keep anything content and sure enough not long until the divine wife could see change in the man he grew listless and kept to one place prone by the river and looked up but seldom and then always with moody face interest was dying in him and when she made sure of it even while she was saying to herself the creature is sick of his being there was roar of the creative will at work again and in twinkling the earth theretofore all thing of coldest gray ﬂamed with colors the mountains swam in purple the plains bearing grass and trees turned green the sea blue and the clouds varied inﬁnitely and the man sprang up and clapped his hands he was cured and happy again and isis smiled and knit away saying to herself it was well thought and will little while but mere beauty in world is not enough such being my lord must try with the last word the thunder of the will at work shook the moon and looking isis dropped her knitting and clapped her hands theretofore everything on the earth but the man had been ﬁxed to given place now all living and much that was not living received the gift of motion the birds took to wing joyously beasts great and small went about each in its way project gutenberg https shook their verdurous branches nodding to the enamoured winds the rivers ran to the seas and the seas tossed in their beds and rolled in crested waves and with surging and ebbing painted the shores with glistening foam and over all the clouds ﬂoated like sailed ships unanchored and the man rose up happy child whereat osiris was pleased so that he shouted ha ha see how well i am doing without thee the good wife took up her work and answered ever so quietly it was well thought my so well will serve and before so again the sight of things in motion became to the man of course the birds in ﬂight the rivers running the seas in tumult of action ceased to amus him and he pined again even worse and isis waited saying to herself poor creature he is more wretched than ever and if he heard the thought osiris stirred and the noise of his will shook the universe the sun in its central seat alone stood ﬁrm and isis looked but saw change then while she was smiling assured that her lord s last invention was sped suddenly the creature arose and seemed to listen and his face brightened and he clapped his hands joy sounds were heard the ﬁrst time on dissonant sounds harmonious the winds murmured in the trees the birds sang each kind song of its own or chattered in speech the rivulets running to the rivers became so many harpers with harps of silver strings all tinkling together and the rivers running to the seas surged on in solemn accord while the seas beat the land to tune of thunder there was music music everywhere and all the time so the man could not but be happy then isis mused thinking how well how wondrous well her lord was doing but presently she shook her head color motion she repeated them was element else of beauty except form and light and to them the earth had been born now indeed osiris was done and if the creature should again fall off into wretchedness her help must be asked and her ﬁngers three ﬁve even ten stitches she took at once and the man was happy long longer than ever before it seemed indeed he would never tire again but isis knew better and she waited and waited nor minded the many laughs ﬂung at her from the sun she waited and waited and at last saw signs of the end sounds became familiar to him and in their range from the chirruping of the cricket under the roses to the roar of the seas and the bellow of the clouds in storm there was not anything unusual and he pined and sickened and sought his place of moping by the river and at last fell down motionless then isis in pity spoke my lord she said the creature is but osiris though seeing it all held his peace he could more shall i help him she asked osiris was too proud to speak then isis took the last stitch in her knitting and gathering her work in roll of brilliance ﬂung it it so it fell close to the man and he hearing the sound of the fall so near by project gutenberg https and lo first stooping to help him she reached hand to him he caught it and arose and nevermore was miserable but evermore happy such son of hur is the genesis of the beautiful they tell it on the she paused pretty invention and cunning he said directly but it is imperfect what did osiris afterwards oh yes she replied he called the divine wife back to the sun and they went on all pleasantly together each helping the other and shall i not the ﬁrst man he carried the hand resting upon his neck to his lips in in love he said his head dropped softly into her lap you will ﬁnd the king she said placing her other hand caressingly upon his head you will go on and ﬁnd the king and serve him with your sword you will earn his richest gifts and his best soldier will be my he turned his face and saw hers close above in all the sky there was that moment nothing so bright to him her eyes enshadowed though they were presently he sat up and put his arms about her and kissed her passionately saying egypt egypt if the king has crowns in gift one shall be mine and i will bring it and put it here over the place my lips have marked you shall be my one more beautiful and we will be ever ever so happy and you will tell everything and let help you in all she said kissing him in return the question chilled his fervor is it not enough that i love you he asked perfect love means perfect faith she replied but never mind will know better she took her hand from him and arose you are cruel he said moving away she stopped by the camel and touched its front face with her lips thou noblest of thy kind because there is suspicion in thy an instant and she was project gutenberg https v the third day of the journey the party nooned by the river jabbok where there were hundred or more men mostly of peraea resting themselves and their beasts hardly had they dismounted before man came to them with pitcher of water and bowl and offered them drink they received the attention with much courtesy he said looking at the camel i am returning from the jordan where just now there are many people from distant parts travelling you are illustrious friend but they had none of them the equal of your servant here very noble animal may i ask of what breed he is sprung balthasar answered and sought his rest but more curious took up the remark at what place on the river are the people he asked at it used to be lonesome ford said i can not understand how it can have become of such i see the stranger replied you too are from abroad and have not heard the good what tidings well man has appeared out of the very holy his mouth full of strange words which take hold of all who hear them he calls himself john the nazarite son of zacharias and says he is the messenger sent before the even iras listened closely while the man continued they say of this john that he has spent his life from childhood in cave down by praying and living more strictly than the essenes crowds go to hear him preach i went to hear him with the have all these your friends been there most of them are going few are coming away what does he preach new never before taught in israel all say he calls it repentance and baptism the rabbis not know what to make of him nor we some have asked him if he is the christ others if he is elias but to them all he has the answer i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord at this point the man was called away by his friends he was going balthasar spoke good stranger he said tremulously tell us if we shall ﬁnd the preacher at the place you left yes at who should this nazarite be said to iras if not the herald of our king in so short time he had come to regard the daughter more interested in the mysterious personage he was looking than project gutenberg https father nevertheless the latter with positive glow in his sunken eyes half arose and said let us make haste i am not they turned away to help the slave there was little conversation between the three at the place the night west of let us arise early son of hur said the old man the saviour may come and we not the king can not be far behind his herald iras whispered she prepared to take her place on the camel we will see replied kissing her hand next day about the third hour out of the pass through which skirting the base of mount gilead they had journeyed since leaving ramoth the party came upon the barren steppe east of the sacred river opposite them they saw the upper limit of the old palm lands of jericho stretching off to the of judea s blood ran quickly he knew the ford was close at hand content you good balthasar he said we are almost the driver quickened the camel s pace soon they caught sight of booths and tents and tethered animals and then of the river and multitude collected down close by the bank and yet another multitude on the western shore knowing that the preacher was preaching they made greater haste yet they were drawing near suddenly there was commotion in the mass and it began to break up and disperse they were too late let us stay here said to balthasar who was wringing his hands the nazarite may come this way the people were too intent upon what they had heard and too busy in discussion to notice the when some hundreds were gone by and it seemed the opportunity to so much see the nazarite was lost to the latter up the river not far away they beheld person coming towards them of such singular appearance they got all else outwardly the man was rude and uncouth even savage over thin gaunt visage of the hue of brown parchment over his shoulders and down his back below the middle in locks fell covering of hair his eyes were all his right side was naked and of the color of his face and quite meagre shirt of the coarsest camel bedouin the rest of his person to the knees being gathered at the waist by broad girdle of untanned leather his feet were bare scrip also of untanned leather was fastened to the girdle he used knotted staff to help him forward his movement was quick decided and strangely watc hful every little while he tossed the unruly hair from his eyes and peered round if searching somebody the fair egyptian surveyed the son of the desert with surprise not to say disgust presently raising the curtain of the houdah she spoke to who sat his horse near by is that the herald of thy king it is the nazarite he replied without looking project gutenberg https truth he was himself more than disappointed despite his familiarity with the ascetic colonists in dress their indifference to all worldly opinion their constancy to vows which gave them over to every imaginable suffering of body and separated them from others of their kind absolutely if they had not been born like notwithstanding he had been notiﬁed on the way to look nazarite whose simple description of himself was voice from the s dream of the king who was to be so great and so much had colored all his thought of him so that he never doubted to ﬁnd in the forerunner some sign or token of the goodliness and royalty he was announcing gazing at the savage ﬁgure before him the long trains of courtiers whom he had been used to see in the thermae and imperial corridors at rome arose before him forcing comparison shocked shamed bewildered he could only answer it is the with balthasar it was very different the ways of god he knew were not men would have them he had seen the saviour child in manger and was prepared by his faith the rude and simple in connection with the divine reappear ance so he kept his seat his hands crossed upon his breast his lips moving in prayer he was not expecting king in this time of such interest to the and in which they were so differently moved another man had been sitting by himself on stone at the edge of the river thinking yet probably of the sermon he had been hearing now however he arose and walked slowly up from the shore in course to take him across the line the nazarite was pursuing and bring him near the camel and the preacher and the on until they came the former within twenty yards of the animal the latter within ten feet then the preacher stopped and ﬂung the hair from his eyes looked at the stranger threw his hands up signal to all the people in sight and they also stopped each in the pose of listener and when the hush was perfect slowly the staff in the nazarite s right hand came down and pointed to the stranger all those who before were but listeners became watchers also at the same instant under the same impulse balthasar and hur ﬁxed their gaze upon the man pointed out and both took the same impression only in different degree he was moving slowly towards them in clear space little to their front form slightly above the average in stature and slender even delicate his action was calm and deliberate like that habitual to men much given to serious thought upon grave subjects and it well became his costume which was an under garment and reaching to the ankles and an outer robe called the talith on his left arm he carried the usual handkerchief the head the red ﬁllet swinging loose down his side except the ﬁllet and narrow border of blue at the lower edge of the talith his attire was of linen yellowed with dust and road stains possibly the exception should be extended to the tassels which were blue and white prescribed by law rabbis his sandals were of the simplest kind he was without scrip or girdle or staf these points of appearance however the three beholders observed brieﬂy and rather accessories to the head and face of the man the the real sources of the spell they caught in common with all who stood looking at project gutenberg https head was open to the cloudless light except it was draped with hair long and slightly waved and parted in the middle and auburn in tint with tendency to reddish golden where most strongly touched by the sun under broad low forehead under black well arched brows beamed eyes and large and softened to exceeding tenderness by lashes of the great length sometimes seen on children but seldom if ever on men to the other features it would have been difﬁcult to decide whether they were greek or jewish the delicacy of the nostrils and mouth was unusual to the latter type and when it was taken into account with the gentleness of the eyes the pallor of the complexion the ﬁne texture of the hair and the softness of the beard which fell in waves over his throat to his breast never soldier but would have laughed at him in encounter never woman who would not have conﬁded in him at sight never child that would not with quick instinct have given him its hand and whole artless trust nor might any one have said he was not beautiful the features it should be further said were ruled by certain expression which the viewer chose might with equal correctness have been called the effect of intelligence love pity or sorrow though in better speech it was blending of them look easy to fancy the mark of sinle ss soul doomed to the sight and understanding of the utter sinfulnes s of those among whom it was passing yet withal one could have observed the face with thought of weakness in the man so at least would not they who know that the qualities sorrow the results of consciousness of strength to bear suffering oftener than strength to such has been the migh t of martyrs and devotees and the myriads written down in saintly calendars and such indeed was the air of this one slowly he drew the three now mounted and spear in hand was an object to claim the glance of king yet the eyes of the man approaching were all the time raised above not to iras whose loveliness has been so often remarked but to balthasar the old and unserviceable the hush was profound presently the nazarite still pointing with his staff cried in loud voice behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world the many standing still arrested by the action of the speaker and listening what might follow were struck with awe by words so strange and past their understanding upon balthasar they were overpowering he was there to see once more the redeemer of men the faith which had brought him the singular privileges of the time long gone abode yet in his heart and if now it gave him power of vision above that of his power to see and know him whom he was than calling the power miracle let it be thought of the faculty of soul not yet entirely released from the divine relations to which it had been formerly admitted or the ﬁtting reward of life in that age so without examples of life itself miracle the ideal of his faith was before him perfect in face form dress action age and he was in its view and the view was recognition ah now if something should happen to identify the stranger beyond all doubt project gutenberg https that was what did happen exactly at the ﬁtting moment if to assure the trembling egyptian the nazarite repeated the outcry behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world balthasar fell upon his knees him there was need of explanation and if the nazarite knew it he turned to those more immediately about him staring in wonder and continued this is he of whom i said after cometh man which is preferred before he was before and i knew him not but that he should be manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water i saw the spirit descending from heaven like dove and it abode upon him and i knew him not but he that sent to baptize with water the same said unto upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost and i saw and bare record that this paused his staff still pointing at the stranger in the white garments if to give more absolute certainty to both his words and the conclusions i bare record tha t this is the son of god it is he it is he balthasar cried with upraised tearful eyes next moment he sank down insensible in this time it should be remembered was studying the face of the stranger though with an interest entirely different he was not insensible to its purity of feature and its thoughtfulness tenderness humility and holiness but just then there was room in his mind but one is this man and what messiah or king never was apparition more unroyal nay looking at that calm benignant countenance the very idea of war and conquest and lust of dominion smote him like profanation he said if speaking to his own heart balthasar must be right and simonides wrong this man has not come to rebuild the throne of solomon he has neither the nature nor the genius of herod king he may be but not of another and greater than rome it should be understood now that this was not conclusion with but an impression merely and while it was forming while yet he gazed at the wonderful countenance his memory began to throe and struggle surely he said to himself i have seen the man but where and when that the look so calm so pitiful so loving had somewhere in past time beamed upon him that moment it was beaming upon balthasar became an assurance faintly at ﬁrst at last clear light burst of sunshine the scene by the well at nazareth what time the roman guard was dragging him to the galleys returned and all his being thrilled those hands had helped him when he was perishing the face was one of the pictures he had carried in mind ever since in the effusion of feeling excited the explanation of the preacher was lost by him all but the last so marvellous that the world yet rings with them is the son of god leaped from his horse to render homage to his benefactor but iras cried to him help son of hur help or my father will die he stopped looked back then hurried to her assistance she gave him cup and leaving the slave to bring the camel to project gutenberg https he ran to the river water the stranger was gone when he came back at last balthasar was restored to consciousness stretching forth his hands he asked feebly where is he who asked iras an intense instant interest shone upon the good man s face if last wish had been gratiﬁed and he answered son of god whom i have seen believest thou so iras asked in low voice of the time is full of wonders let us wait was all he said and next day while the three were listening to him the nazarite broke off in saying reverently behold the lamb of god looking to where he pointed they beheld the stranger again surveyed the slender ﬁgure and holy beautiful countenance compassionate to sadness new idea broke upon him balthasar is is simonides may not the redeemer be king also and he asked one at his side who is the man walking yonder the other laughed mockingly and replied he is the son of carpenter over in project gutenberg https eighth who could resist who in this universe she did so breathe ambrosia so immerse my ﬁne existence in golden clime she took like child of and cradled in roses thus condemn d the current of my former life was stemm d and to this arbitrary queen of sense i bow d tranced endymion i am the resurrection and the project gutenberg https i speak to the

evidences of the higher tastes acquired by the young proprietor during his years of residence in the villa by misenum and in the roman capital now it should not be inferred from this explanation that hur had publicly assumed ownership of the property in his opinion the hour that was not yet come neither had he yet taken his proper name passing the time in the labors of preparation in galilee he waited patiently the action of the nazarene who became daily more and more mystery to him and by prodigies done often before his eyes kept him in state of anxious doubt both to his character and mission occasionally he came up to the holy city stopping at the paternal house always however stranger and guest these visits of it should also be observed were more than mere rest from labor balthasar and iras made their home in the palace and the charm of the daughter was still upon him with all its original freshness while the father though feebler in body held him an unﬂagging listener to speeches of astonishing power urging the divinity of the wandering of whom they were all so expectant to simonides and esther they had arrived from antioch only few days before this their wearisome journey to the merchant borne he had been in palanquin swung between two camels which in their careening did not always keep the same step but now that he was come the good man it seemed could not see enough of his native land he delighted in the perch upon the roof and spent most of his day hours there seated in an the duplicate of that one kept him in the cabinet over the by the orontes in the shade of the summer project gutenberg https could drink fully of the inspiring air lying lightly upon the familiar hills he could better watch the sun rise run its course and set it used to in the not habit lost and with esther by him it was so much easier up there close to the sky to bring back the other esther his love in youth his wife dearer growing with the passage of years and yet he was not unmindful of business every day messenger brought him despatch from sanballat in charge of the big commerce behind and every day despatch left him sanballat with directions of such minuteness of detail to exclude all judgment save his own and all chances except those the almighty has refused to submit to the most mindful of men esther started in return to the summe the sunlight fell softly upon the dustless roof showing her woman graceful in form of regular features rosy with youth and health bright with intelligence beautiful with the outshining of devoted woman to be loved because loving was habit of life irrepressible with her she looked at the package she turne d paused looked at it second time more closely than at ﬁrst and the blood rose reddening her seal was s with quickened steps she hastened on simonides held the package moment while he also inspected the seal breaking it open he gave her the roll it contained read he said his eyes were upon her he spoke and instantly troubled expression fell upon his own face you know who it is from i see esther master though the manner was halting she met his gaze with modest sincerity slowly his chin sank into the roll of ﬂesh puffed out under it like cushion you love him esther he said quietly yes she answered have you thought well of what you i have tried not to think of him father except the master to whom i am dutifully bound the effort has not helped to good girl good girl even thy mother was he said dropping into reverie from which she roused him by unrolling the paper the lord forgive thy love might not have been vainly given had i kept fast hold of all i had i might have done power is there in money it would have been worse had you done so father then i had been unworthy look from him and without pride in you shall i not read now in moment he said let your sake my child show you the worst seeing it with may make it less terrible to you his love esther is all i know it she said calmly the egyptian has him in her net he continued she has the cunning of her race with beauty to help beauty great cunning but like her race again heart the daughter who despises her father will bring her husband to project gutenberg https does she that simonides went on balthasar is wise man who has been wonderfully favored gentile and his faith becomes him yet she makes jest of it i heard her say speaking of him yesterday the follies of youth are excusable nothing is admirable in the aged except wisdom and when that goes from them they should cruel speech ﬁt roman i applied it to myself know ing feebleness like her father s will come to it is not far off but you esther will never say of it were better he were your mother was daughter of with tears she kissed him and said i am my mother s yes and my daughter who is to all the temple was to after silence he laid his hand upon her shoulder and resumed when he has taken the egyptian to wife esther he will think of you with repentance and much calling of the spirit at last he will awake to ﬁnd himself but the minister of her bad ambition rome is the centre of all her dreams to her he is the son of arrius the duumvir not the son of hur prince of esther made attempt to conceal the ef fect of these words save him father it is not too late she said entreatingly he answered with dubious smile man drowning may be saved not so man in but you have inﬂuence with him he is alone in the world show him his danger tell him what woman she that might save him from her would it give him to you esther and his brows fell darkly over his eyes i am servant my fathers were generations yet i could not say to him lo master my daughter she is fairer than the egyptian and loves thee better i have caught too much from years of liberty and direction the words would blister my tongue the stones upon the old hills yonder would turn in their beds shame when i go out to them by the patriarchs esther i would rather lay us both with your mother to sleep she sleeps blush burned esther s whole face i did not mean you to tell him so father i was concerned him his happiness not mine because i have dared love him i shall keep myself worthy his respect so only can i excuse my folly let read his letter now yes read she began at once in haste to conclude the distasteful subject nisan 8th day on the road from galilee to jerusalem the nazarene is on the way also with him though without his knowledge i am bringing full legion of mine second legion follows the passover will excuse the multitude he said upon setting out we will go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning shall be our waiting draws to an end in haste peace to thee project gutenberg https esther returned the letter to her father while choking sensation gathered in her throat there was not word in the missive her even in the salutation had she it would have been so easy to have written and to thine the ﬁrst time in her life she felt the smart of jealous sting the eighth day said simonides the eighth day and this esther this is the ninth she replied ah then they may be in bethany now and possibly we may see him she added pleased into momentary getfulness it may be it may be is the feast of unleavened bread and he may wish to celebrate it so may the nazarene and we may see may see both of them esther at this point the servant appeared with the wine and water esther helped her father and in the midst of the service iras came upon the roof to the jewess the egyptian never appeared so very very beautiful at that moment her gauzy garments ﬂuttered about her like little cloud of mist her forehead neck and arms glittered with the massive jewelry so affected by her people her countenance was suffused with pleasure she moved with buoyant steps and though without affectation esther at the sight shrank within herself and nestled closer to her father peace to you simonides and to the pretty esther peace said iras inclining her head to the latter you remind good master i may say it without remind of the priests in persia who climb their temples at the decline of day to send prayers after the departing sun is there anything in the worship you not know let call my father he is fair egyptian the merchant replied nodding with grave politeness your father is good man who would not be offended if he knew i told you his persian lore is the least part of his iras s lip curled slightly to speak like philosopher you invite she said the least part always implies greater let ask what you esteem the greater part of the rare quality you are pleased to attribute to simonides turned upon her somewhat sternly pure wisdom always directs itself towards god the purest wisdom is knowledge of god and man of my acquaintance has it in higher degree or makes it more manifest in speech and act than the good balthasar to end the parley he raised the cup and drank the egyptian turned to esther little testily man who has millions in store and ﬂeets of ships at sea can not discern in what simple women like us ﬁnd amusement let us leave him by the wall yonder we can they went to the parapet then stopping at the place where years before loosed the broken tile upon the head of gratus you have not been to rome iras bega n toying the while with one of her unclasped project gutenberg https said esther demurely have you not wished to go ah how little there has been of your life the sigh that succeeded the exclamation could not have been more piteously expressive had the loss been the egyptian s own next moment her laugh might have been heard in the street below and she said oh oh my pretty simple ton the birds nested in the ear of the great bust out on the memphian sands know nearly much then seeing esther s confusion she changed her manner and said in conﬁding tone you must not take offence oh i was playing let kiss the hurt and tell you what i would not to any if simbel himself asked it of offering of the spray of the nile another laugh masking excellently the look she turned sharply upon the jewess and she said the king is esther gazed at her in innocent surprise the nazarene iras he whom our fathers have been talking about so much whom has been serving and toiling so long voice dropped several tones the nazarene will be here and esther struggled to maintain her composure but failed her eyes fell the blood surged to her cheek and forehead and she was saved sight of the triumphant smile that passed like gleam over the face of the egyptian see here is his and from her girdle she took roll rejoice with my friend he will be here tonight on the tiber there is house royal property which he has pledged to and to be its mistress is to sound of some one walking swiftly along the street below interrupted the speech and she leaned over the parapet to see then she drew back and cried with hands clasped above her head now blessed be isis tis himself that he should appear while i had such thought of him there are gods if it be not good omen put your arms about kiss the jewess looked up upon each cheek there was glow her eyes sparkled with light more nearly of anger than ever her nature emitted before her gentleness had been too roughly overridden it was not enough her to be forbidden more than fugitive dreams of the man she loved boastful rival must tell her in conﬁdence of her better success and of the brilliant promises which were its rewards of her the servant of servant there had been hint of remembrance this other could show his letter leaving her to imagine all it breathed so she said dost thou love him so much then or rome so much better the egyptian drew back step then she bent her haughty head quite near her questioner what is he to thee daughter of simonides esther all thrilling began he is thought blasting lightning stayed the words she paled trembled recovered and project gutenberg https he is my father s her tongue had refused to admit her servile condition iras laughed more lightly than before not more than that she said ah by the lover of egypt thou mayst keep thy them thou hast taught but now that there are others vastly more estimable waiting here in judea and turned away looking back over her i will go get them peace to esther saw her disappear down the steps when putting her hands over her face she burst into tears so they ran scalding through her of shame and choking passion and to deepen the paroxysm to her even temper so strange up with new meaning of withering force rose her father s thy love might not have been vainly given had i kept fast hold of all i had i might have and all the stars were out burning low above the city and the dark wall of mountains about it before she recovered enough to go back to the summer and in silence take her accustomed place at her father s side humbly waiting his pleasure to such duty it seemed her youth if not her life must be given and let the truth be said now that the pang was spent she went not unwillingly back to the duty project gutenberg https ii an hour or thereabouts after the scene upon the roof balthasar and simonides the latter attended by esther met in the great chamber of the palace and while they were talking and iras came in together the young jew advancing in front of his companion walked ﬁrst to balthasar and saluted him and received his reply then he turned to simonides but paused at sight of esther it is not often we have hearts roomy enough more than one of the absorbing passions at the same time in its blaze the others may continue to live but only lesse r lights so with much study of possibilities indulgence of hopes and dreams inﬂuences born of the condition of his country inﬂuences more of iras made him in the broadest worldly sense ambitious and he had given the passion place allowing it to become rule and ﬁnally an imperious governor the resolves and impulses of former days faded imperceptibly out of being and at last almost out of recollection it is at best so easy to forget our youth in his case it was but natural that his own sufferings and the mystery darkening the fate of his family should move him less and less in hope at least he approached nearer and nearer the goals which occupied all his visions only let us not judge him too harshly he paused in surprise at seeing esther woman now and so beautiful and he stood looking at her still voice reminded him of broken vows and duties undone almost his old self returned an instant he was startled but recov ering he went to esther and said peace to thee sweet and thou simonides looked to the merchant he the blessing of the lord be thine if only because thou hast been good father to the esther heard him with downcast face simonides answered i repeat the welcome of the good balthasar son of welcome to thy father s house and sit and tell us of thy travels and of thy work and of the wonderful he is and what if thou art not at ease here who shall be sit i between us that we may all hear esther stepped out quickly and brought covered stool and set it him thanks he said to her gratefully when seated after some other conversation he addressed himself to the men i have come to tell you of the the two became instantly attentive many days now i have followed him with such watchfulness one may give another upon whom he is waiting so anxiously i have seen him under all circumstances said to be trials and tests of men and while i am certain he is man i am not less certain am i that he is something project gutenberg https what more asked simonides i will tell some one coming into the room interrupted him he turned and arose with extended hands amrah dear old amrah he cried she came forward and they seeing the joy in her face thought not once how wrinkled and tawny it was she knelt at his feet clasped his knees and kissed his hands over and over and when he could he put the lank gray hair from her cheeks and kissed them saying good amrah have you nothing nothing of not one little sign then she broke into sobbing which made him answer plainer even than the spoken word god s will has been done he next said solemnly in tone to make each listener know he had hope more of ﬁnding his people in his eyes there were tears which he would not have them see because he was man when he could again he took seat and said come sit by then at my feet i have much to say to these good friends of wonderful man come into the but she went off and stooping with her back to the wall joined her hands before her knees content they all thought with seeing him then bowing to the old men began again i fear to answer the question asked about the nazarene without ﬁrst telling you some of the things i have seen him and to that i am the more inclined my friends because he will come to the city and go up into the temple which he calls his father s house where it is further said he will proclaim himself so whether you are right balthasar or you simonides we and israel shall know balthasar rubbed his hands tremulously together and asked where shall i go to see him the pressure of the crowd will be very great better i think that you all go upon the roof above the upon the porch of can you be with us said my friends will require perhaps in the procession exclaimed simonides does he travel in state saw the ar gument in mind he brings twelve men with him ﬁshermen tillers of the soil one publican all of the humbler class and he and they make their journeys on foot careless of wind cold rain or sun seeing them stop by the wayside at nightfall to break bread or lie down to sleep i have been reminded of party of shepherds going back to their ﬂocks from market not of nobles and kings only when he lifts the corners of his handkerchief to look at some one or shake the dust from his head i am made known he is their teacher well their superior not less than their friend you are shrewd men resumed after pause you know what creatures of certain master motives we are and that it has become little less than law of our nature to spend life in eager pursuit of certain objects now appealin g to that law something by which we may know ourselves what would you say of project gutenberg https could be rich by making gold of the stones under his feet yet is poor of choice the greeks would call him philosopher said iras nay daughter said balthasar the philosophers had never the power to such how know you this man has answered quickly i saw him turn water into very strange very strange said simonides but it is not so strange to that he should prefer to live poor when he could be so rich is he so poor he owns nothing and envies nobody his owning he pities the rich but passing that what would you say to see man multiply seven loaves and two ﬁshes all his store into enough to feed ﬁve thousand people and have full baskets over that i saw the nazarene you saw it exclaimed simonides ay and ate of the bread and more marvellous still continued what would you say of man in whom there is such healing virtue that the sick have but to touch the hem of his garment to be cured or cry to him afar that too i witnessed not once but many times we came out of jericho two blind men by the wayside called to the nazarene and he touched their eyes and they saw so they brought palsied man to him and he said merely go unto thy house and the man went away well what say you to these things the merchant had answer think you now i have heard others argue that what i have told you are tricks of jugglery let answer by recalling greater things which i have seen him look ﬁrst to that curse of comfortless you all know except by at these words amrah dropped her hands to the ﬂoor and in her eagerness to hear him half arose what would you say said with increased what would you say to have seen that i now tell you leper came to the nazarene while i was with him down in galilee and said lord if thou wilt thou canst make he heard the cry and touched the outcast with his hand saying be thou clean and forthwith the man was himself again healthful any of us who beheld the cure and we were here amrah arose and with her gaunt ﬁngers held the wiry locks from her eyes the brain of the poor creature had long since gone to heart and she was troubled to follow the speech then again said without stop ten lepers came to him one day in body and falling at his feet called saw and heard it out master master have mercy upon us he told them go show yourselves to the priest the law requires and before you are come there ye shall be and were they yes on the road going their inﬁrmity left them so that there was nothing to remind us of it except their polluted such thing was never heard ever in all israel said simonides in project gutenberg https then while he was speaking amrah turned away and walked noiselessly to the door and went out and none of the company saw her go the thoughts stirred by such things done under my eyes i leave you to imagine said continuing but my doubts my misgivings my amazement were not yet at the full the people of galilee are you know impetuous and rash after years of waiting their swords burned their hands nothing would them but action he is slow to declare himself let us force him they cried to and i too became impatient if he is to be king why not now the legions are ready so he was once teaching by the seaside we would have crowned him whether or not but he disappeared and was next seen on ship departing from the shore good simonides the desires that make other men power even kingships offered out of great love by great people this one not at all what say you the merchant s chin was low upon his breast raising his head he replied resolutely the lord liveth and so the words of the prophets time is in the green yet let answer be it so said balthasar smiling and said be it then he went on but i have not yet done from these things not too great to be above suspicion by such did not see them in performance i did let carry you now to others inﬁnitely greater acknowledged since the world began to be past the power of man tell has any one to your knowledge ever reached out and taken from death what death has made his own who ever gave again the breath of life lost who god said balthasar reverently bowed wise egyptian i may not refuse the name you lend what would you would you either or both have said had you seen i did man with few words and ceremony without effort more than mother s when she speaks to wake her child asleep undo the work of death it was down at nain we were about going into the gate when company came out bearing dead man the nazarene stopped to let the train pass there was woman among them crying i saw his face soften with pity he spoke to her then went and touched the bier and said to him who lay upon it dressed burial young man i say unto thee arise and instantly the dead sat up and god only is so great said balthasar to simonides mark you proceeded i but tell you things of which i was witness together with cloud of other men on the way hither i saw another act still more mighty in bethany there was man named lazarus who died and was buried and after he had lain four days in tomb shut in by great stone the nazarene was shown to the place upon rolling the stone away we beheld the man lying inside bound and rotting there were many people standing by and we all heard what the nazarene said he spoke in loud voice lazarus come forth i can not tell you my feelings when in answer it were the man arose and came out to us with all his cerements about him loose him said the nazarene next loose him and let him and when the napkin was taken from the face of the resurr ected lo my friends the blood ran anew through the wasted body and he was exactly project gutenberg https been in life before the sickness that took him off he lives yet and is hourly seen and spoken to you may go see him and now nothing more is needed the purpose i ask you that which i came to ask it being but repetition of what you asked simonides what more than man is this nazarene the question was put solemnly and long after midnight the company sat and debated it simonides being yet unwilling to give up his understanding of the sayings of the prophets and contending that the elder disputants were both the nazarene was the redeemer claimed by balthasar and also the destined king the merchant would have we will see peace to you so saying took his leave intending to return to bethany project gutenberg https iii the ﬁrst person to go out of the city upon the opening of the sheep s gate next morning was amrah basket on arm questions were asked her by the keepers since the morning itself had not been more regular in coming than she they knew her somebody s faithful servant and that was enough them down the eastern valley she took her way the side of olivet darkly green was spotted with white tents recently put up by people attending the feasts the hour however was too early the strangers to be abroad still had it not been so one would have troubled her past gethsemane past the tombs at the meeting of the bethany roads past the sepulchral village of siloam she went occasionally the decrepit little body staggered once she sat down to get her breath rising shortly she struggled on with renewed haste the great rocks on either hand if they had had ears might have heard her mutter to herself could they have seen it would have been to observe how frequently she looked up over the mount reproving the dawn its promptness if it had been possible them to gossip not improbably they would have said to each other our friend is in hurry this morning the mouths she goes to feed must be very hungry when at last she reached the king s garden she slackened her gait then the grim city of the lepers was in view extending far round the pitted south hill of hinnom the reader must by this time have surmised she was going to her mistress whose tomb it will be remembered overlooked the well early it was the unhappy woman was up and sitting outside leaving tirzah asleep within the course of the malady had been terribly swift in the three years conscious of her appearance with the reﬁned instincts of her nature she kept her whole person habitually covered seldom possible she permitted even tirzah to see her this morning she was taking the air with bared head knowing there was one to be shocked by the exposure the light was not full but enough to show the ravages to which she had been subject her hair was and unmanageably coarse falling over her back and shoulders like so much silver wire the eyelids the lips the nostrils the ﬂesh of the cheeks were either gone or reduced to fetid rawness the neck was mass of colored scales one hand lay outside the folds of her habit rigid that of skeleton the nails had been eaten away the joints of the ﬁngers if not bare to the bone were swollen knots crusted with red secretion head face neck and hand indicated all too plainly the condition of the whole body seeing her thus it was easy to understand how the once fair widow of the princely hur had been able to maintain her incognito so well through such period of years when the sun would gild the crest of olivet and the mount of offence with light sharper and more brilliant in that old land than in the west she knew amrah would come ﬁrst to the well then project gutenberg https stone midway the well and the foot of the hill on which she had her abode and that the good servant would there deposit the food she carried in the basket and ﬁll the water afresh the day of her former plentitude of happiness that brief visit was all that remained to the unfortunate she could then ask about her son and be told of his welfare with such bits of news concerning him the messenger could glean usually the information was meagre enough yet comforting at times she heard he was at home then she would issue from her dreary cell at break of day and sit till noon and from noon to set of sun motionless ﬁgure draped in white looking invariably to one the temple to the spot under the rounded sky where the old house stood dear in memory and dearer because he was there nothing else was left her tirzah she counted of the dead and herself she simply waited the end knowing every hour of life was an hour of of painless dying the things of nature about the hill to keep her sensitive to the world s attractions were wretchedly scant beasts and birds avoided the place if they knew its history and present use every green thing perished in its ﬁrst season the winds warred upon the shrubs and venturous grasses leaving to drought such they could not uproot look where she would the view was made depressingly suggestive by above her tombs below tombs opposite her own now freshly whitened in warning to visiting pilgrims in the fair would think she might have found some relief to her ache of mind but alas in making the beautiful elsewhere the sun served her never so did but disclose her growing hideousness but the sun she would not have been the horror she was to herself nor been waked so cruelly from dreams of tirzah she used to be the gift of seeing can be sometimes dreadful curse does one ask why she did not make an end to her suf ferings the la w forbade her gentile may smile at the answer but so will not son of israel while she sat there peopling the dusky solitude with thoughts even more cheerless suddenly woman came up the hill staggering and spent with exertion the widow arose hastily and covering her head cried in voice unnaturally harsh unclean unclean in moment heedless of the notice amrah was at her feet all the love of the simple creature burst forth with tears and passionate exclamations she kissed her mistress s garments and while the latter strove to escape from her then seeing she could not she waited till the violence of the paroxysm was over what have you done amrah she said is it by such disobedience you prove your love us wicked woman you are lost and can never never go back to amrah grovelled sobbing in the dust the ban of the law is upon you too you can not return to jerusalem what will become of us who will bring us bread wicked wicked amrah we are all all undone alike mercy mercy amrah answered from the ground you should have been merciful to yourself and by so doing been most merciful to us now where can we ﬂy there is project gutenberg https help us false servant the wrath of the lord was already too heavy upon here tirzah awakened by the noise appeared at the door of the tomb the pen shrinks from the picture she presented in the clad apparition patched with scales lividly seamed nearly blind its limbs and extremities swollen to grotesque largeness familiar eyes however sharpened by love could not have recognized the creature of childish grace and purity we ﬁrst beheld her is it amrah mother the servant tried to crawl to her also stay amrah the widow cried imperiously i forbid you touching her rise and get you gone before any at the well see you here nay i is too late you must remain now and share our doom rise i say amrah rose to her knees and said brokenly and with clasped hands good mistress i am not am not wicked i bring you good of judah and she spoke the widow half withdrew the cloth from her head there is wonderful man amrah continued who has power to cure you he speaks word and the sick are made well and even the dead come to life i have come to take you to poor amrah said tirzah compassionately cried amrah detecting the doubt underlying the the lord lives even the lord of israel my god well yours i speak the truth go with i pray and lose time this morning he will pass by on his way to the city see the day is at hand take the food and let us the mother listened eagerly not unlikely she had heard of the wonderful man by this time his fame had penetrated every nook in the land who is he she asked who told you about him judah told you is he at home he came last the widow trying to still the beating of her heart was silent awhile did judah send you to tell us this she next asked he believes you there was prophet once who cured leper the mother said thoughtfully to tirzah but he had his power from then addressing amrah she asked how does my son know this man so possessed he was travelling with him and heard the lepers call and saw them go away well first there was one man then there were ten and they were all made the elder listener was silent again the skeleton hand shook we may believe she was struggling to give the story the sanction of faith which is always an absolutist in demand and that it was with her with the men of the day of what was done by the christ well the myriads who have succeeded them project gutenberg https not question the performance her own son was the witness testifying through the servant but she strove to comprehend the power by which work so astonishing could be done by man well enough to make inquiry to the fact to comprehend the power on the other hand it is ﬁrst necessary to comprehend god and he who waits that will die waiting with her however the hesitation was brief to tirzah she said this must be the messiah she spoke not coldly like one reasoning doubt away but woman of israel familiar with the promises of god to her woman of understanding ready to be glad over the least sign of the realization of the promises there was time when jerusalem and all judea were ﬁlled with story that he was born i remember it by this time he should be man it must is he yes she said to amrah we will go with you bring the water which you will ﬁnd in the tomb in jar and set the food us we will eat and be the breakfast partaken under excitement was soon despatched and the three women set out on their extraordinary journey tirzah had caught the conﬁdent spirit of the others there was but one fear that troubled the party bethany amrah said was the town the man was coming from now from that to jerusalem there were three roads or rather over the ﬁrst summit of olivet second at its base third between the second summit and the mount of offence the three were not far apart far enough however to make it possible the unfortunates to miss the nazarene if they failed the one he chose to come by little questioning satisﬁed the mother that amrah knew nothing of the country beyond the cedron and even less of the intentions of the man they were going to see if they could she discerned also that both amrah and one from conﬁrmed habits of servitude the other from natural looked to her guidance and she accepted the char ge we will go ﬁrst to bethphage she said to them there if the lord favor us we may learn what else to they descended the hill to tophet and the king s garden and paused in the deep trail furrowed through them by centuries of wayfaring i am afraid of the road the matron said better that we keep to the country among the rocks and trees this is and on the yonder i see signs of great multitude in attendance by going across the mount of of fence here we may avoid tirzah had been walking with great difﬁculty upon hearing this her heart began to fail her the mount is steep mother i can not climb remember we are going to ﬁnd health and life see my child how the day brightens around us and yonder are women coming this way to the well they will stone us if we stay here come be strong this thus the mother not less tortured herself sought to inspire the daughter and amrah came to her aid to this time the latter had not touched the persons of the afﬂicted nor they her now in disregard of consequences well of command the faithful creature went to tirzah and put her arm over her shoulder project gutenberg https lean on i am strong though i am old and it is but little way of we can the face of the hill they essayed to cross was somewhat broken with pits and ruins of old structures but when at last they stood upon the top to rest and looked at the spectacle presented them over in the the temple and its courtly terraces at zion at the enduring towers white beetling into the sky the mother was strengthened with love of life life s sake look tirzah she look at the plates of gold on the gate beautiful how they give back the ﬂames of the sun brightness brightness you remember we used to go up there will it not be pleasant to so again and is but little way off i can almost see it over the roof of the holy of holies and judah will be there to receive us from the side of the middle summit garnished green with myrtle and olive trees they saw upon looking that way next thin columns of smoke rising lightly and straight up into the pulseless morning each warning of restless pilgrims astir and of the ﬂight of the pitiless hours and the need of haste though the good servant toiled faithfully to lighten the labor in descending the not sparing herself in the least the girl moaned at every step sometimes in extremity of anguish she cried out upon reaching the is the road between the mount of offence and the middle or second summit of fell down exhausted go on with amrah mother and leave here she said faintly tirzah what would the gain be to if i were healed and you not when judah asks you he will what would i have to say to him were i to leave you tell him i loved the elder leper arose from bending over the fainting sufferer and gazed about her with that sensation of hope perishing which is more nearly like annihilation of the soul than anything else the supremest joy of the thought of cure was inseparable from tirzah who was not too old to forget in the happiness of healthful life to come the years of misery by which she had been so reduced in body and broken in spirit even the brave woman was about leaving the venture they were engaged in to the determination of god she saw man on foot coming rapidly up the road from the east courage tirzah be of cheer she said yonder i know is one to tell us of the amrah helped the girl to sitting posture and supported her while the man advanced in your goodness mother you forget what we are the stranger will go around us his best gift to us will be curse if not we will there was other answer to be given since the mother was too well and sadly acquainted with the treatment outcasts of the class to which she belonged were accustomed to at the hands of her countrymen has been said the road at the edge of which the group was posted was little more than worn path or trail winding crookedly through tumuli of limestone if the stranger kept it he must project gutenberg https face to face and he did so until near enough to hear the cry she was bound to give then uncovering her head further demand of the law she shouted shrilly unclean unclean to her surprise the man came steadily on what would you have he asked stopping opposite them not four yards of thou seest us have care the mother said with dignity woman i am the courier of him who speaketh but once to such thou and they are healed i am not the nazarene the messiah he said is it true that he cometh to the city he is now at on what road master this she clasped her hands and looked up thankfully whom takest thou him the man asked with pity the son of god she replied stay thou here then or there is multitude with him take thy stand by the rock yonder the white one under the tree and he goeth by fail not to call to him call and fear not if thy faith but equal thy knowledge he will hear thee though all the heavens thunder i go to tell israel assembled in and about the city that he is at hand and to make ready to receive him peace to thee and thine the stranger moved on did you hear tirzah did you hear the nazarene is on the road on this one and he will hear us once more my only once and let us to the rock it is but thus encouraged tirzah took amrah s hand and arose but they were going amrah said stay the man is and they waited him i pray your grace woman he said upon overtaking them remembering that the sun will be hot before the nazarene arrives and that the city is near by to give refreshment should i need it i thought this water would thee better than it will take it and be of good cheer call to him he he followed the words by offering her gourd full of water such sometimes carried with them in their journeys across the hills and instead of placing the gift on the ground her to take up when he was at safe distance he gave it into her hand art thou jew she asked surprised i am that and better i am disciple of the christ who teacheth daily by word and example this thing which i have done unto you the world hath long known the word charity without understanding it again i say peace and good cheer to thee and he went on and they went slowly to the rock he had pointed out to them high their heads and scarcely thirty yards from the road on the right standing in front of it the mother satisﬁed herself they could be seen and heard plainly by project gutenberg https they desired to attract there they cast themselves under the tree in its shade and drank of the gourd and rested refreshed ere long tirzah slept and fearing to disturb her the others held their project gutenberg https iv during the third hour the road in front of the of the lepers became gradually more and more frequented by people going in the direction of bethphage and bethany now however about the commencement of the fourth hour great crowd appeared over the crest of olivet and it deﬁled down the road thousands in number the two watchers noticed with wonder that every one in it carried freshly cut they sat absorbed by the novelty the noise of another multitude approaching from the east drew their eyes that way then the mother awoke tirzah what is the meaning of it all the latter asked he is coming answered the mother these we see are from the city going to meet him those we hear in the east are his friends bearing him company and it will not be strange if the processions meet here before us i fear if they we can not be the same thought was in the elder s mind amrah she asked when judah spoke of the healing of the ten in what words did he say they called to the nazarene either they said lord have mercy upon us or master have mercy only that more that i yet it was enough the mother added to herself yes said amrah judah said he saw them go away meantime the people in the east came up slowly when at length the foremost of them were in sight the gaze of the lepers ﬁxed upon man riding in the midst of what seemed chosen company which sang and danced about him in extravagance of joy the rider was bareheaded and clad all in white when he was in distance to be more clearly observed these looking anxiously saw an hued face shaded by long chestnut hair slightly sunburned and parted in the middle he looked neither to the right nor left in the noisy abandon of his followers he appeared to have part nor did their favor disturb him in the least or raise him out of the profound melancholy into which his countenance showed he was plunged the sun beat upon the back of his head and lighting up the ﬂoating hair gave it delicate likeness to golden nimbus behind him the irregular procession pouring forward with continuous singing and shouting extended out of view there was need of any one to tell the lepers that this was wonderful nazarene he is here tirzah the mother said he is here come my she spoke she glided in front of the white rock and fell upon her knees directly the daughter and servant were by her side then at sight of the procession in the west the thous ands from the city project gutenberg https began to wave their green branches shouting or rather chanting it was all in one voice blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord and all the thousands who were of the rider s company both those near and those afar replied so the air shook with the sound which was great wind threshing the side of the hill amidst the din the cries of the poor lepers were not more than the twittering of dazed sparrows the moment of the meeting of the hosts was come and with it the opportunity the sufferers were seeking if not taken it would be lost forever and they would be lost well nearer my us get nearer he can not hear us said the mother she arose and staggered forward her ghastly hands were up and she screamed with horrible shrillne ss the people saw saw her hideous face and stopped effect which extreme human misery visible in this instance is potent majesty in purple and gold tirzah behind her little way fell down too faint and frightened to follow farther the lepers the lepers stone them the accursed of god kill them these with other yells of like import broke in upon the hosannas of the part of the multitude too far removed to see and understand the cause of the interruption some there were however near by familiar with the nature of the man to whom the unfortunates were who by long intercourse with him had caught somewhat of his divine compassion they gazed at him and were silent while in fair view he rode up and stopped in front of the woman she also beheld his pitiful and of exceeding beauty the lar ge eyes tender with benignant purpose and this was the colloquy that ensued master master thou seest our need thou canst make us clean have mercy upon believest thou i am able to this he asked thou art he of whom the prophets art the messiah she replied his eyes grew radiant his manner conﬁdent woman he said great is thy faith be it unto thee even thou he lingered an instant after apparently unconscious of the presence of the he rode away to the heart divinely original yet so human in all the better elements of humanity going with sure prevision to death of all the inventions of men the foulest and most cruel breathing even then in the forecast shadow of the awful event and still hungry and thirsty love and faith in the beginning how precious and ineffably soothing the farewell exclamation of the grateful woman to god in the highest glory blessed thrice blessed the son whom he hath given us immediately both the hosts that from the city and that from bethphage closed around him with their joyous demonstrations with hosannas and waving of palms and so he passed from project gutenberg https forever covering her head the elder hastened to tirzah and folded her in her arms crying daughter look up i have his promise he is indeed the messiah we are and the two remained kneeling while the procession slowly going disappeared over the mount when the noise of its singing afar was sound scarcely heard the miracle began there was ﬁrst in the hearts of the lepers freshening of the blood then it ﬂowed faster and stronger thrilling their wasted bodies with an inﬁnitely sweet sense of painless healing each felt the scour ge going from her their strength revived they were returning to be themselves directly if to make the puriﬁcation complete from body to spirit the quickening ran exalting them to very fervor of ecstasy the power possessing them to this good end was most nearly that of draught of swift and happy effect yet it was unlike and superior in that its healing and cleansing were absolute and not merely delicious consciousness while in progress but the planting growing and maturing all at once of recollection so singular and so holy that the simple thought of it should be of itself ever after formless yet perfect thanksgiving to this such it may be called quite properly was witness other than amrah the reader will remember the constancy with which had followed the nazarene throughout his wanderings and now recalling the conversation of the night before there will be little surprise at learning that the young jew was present when the leprous woman appeared in the path of the pilgrims he heard her prayer and saw her disﬁgured face he heard the answer also and was not so accustomed to incidents of the kind frequent they had been to have lost interest in them had such thing been possible with him still the bitter disputation always excited by the simplest display of the master s curativ gift would have sufﬁced to keep his curiosity alive besides that if not above it an incentive his hope to satisfy himself upon the vexed question of the mission of the mysterious man was still upon him strong in the beginning we might indeed say even stronger because of belief that now quickly before the sun went down the man himself would make all known by public proclamation at the close of the scene consequently had withdrawn from the procession and seated himself upon stone to wait its passage from his place he nodded recognition to many of the galileans in his league carrying short swords under their long abbas after little swarthy arab came up leading two horses at sign from he also drew out stay here the young master said when all were gone by even the laggards i wish to be at the city early and aldebaran must he stroked the broad forehead of the horse now in his prime of strength and beauty then crossed the road towards the two women they were to him it should be borne in mind strangers in whom he felt interest only they were subjects of superhuman experiment the result of which might possibly help him to solution of the mystery that had so long engaged him he proceeded he glanced casually at the ﬁgure of the little woman over by the white rock standing there her face hidden in her hands the lord liveth it is amrah he said to project gutenberg https hurried on and passing by the mother and daughter still without recognizing them he stopped before the servant amrah he said to her amrah what you here she rushed forward and fell upon her knees before him blinded by her tears nigh speechless with contending joy and fear master master thy god and mine how good he is the knowledge we gain from much sympathy with others passing through trials is but vaguely understood strangely enough it enables us among other things to merge our identity into theirs often so completely that their sorrows and their delights become our own so poor amrah aloof and hiding her face knew the transformation the lepers were under going without word spoken to it and shared all their feeling to the full her countenance her words her whole manner betrayed her condition and with swift presentiment he connected it with the women he had just passed he felt her presence there at that time was in some way associated with them and turned hastily they arose to their feet his heart stood still he became rooted in his past the woman he had seen before the nazarene was standing with her hands clasped and eyes streaming looking towards heaven the mere transformation would have been sufﬁcient surprise but it was the least of the causes of his emotion could he be mistaken never was there in life stran ger so like his mother and like her she was the day the roman snatched her from him there was but one difference to mar the hair of this person was little streaked with gray yet that was not impossible of reconcilement since the intelligence which had directed the miracle might have taken into consider ation the natural effects of the passage of years and who was it by her side if not tirzah fair beautiful perfect more mature but in all other respects exactly the same in appearance when she looked with him over the parapet the morning of the accident to gratus he had given them over dead and time had accustomed him to the bereavement he had not ceased mourning them yet something distinguishable they had simply dropped out of his plans and dreams scarcely believing his senses he laid his hand upon the servant s head and asked tremulously amrah mother tirzah tell if i see speak to them master speak to them she said he waited longer but ran with outstretched arms crying mother mother tirzah here i am they heard his call and with cry loving started to meet him suddenly the mother stopped drew back and uttered the old alarm stay judah my son come not nearer unclean unclean the utterance was not from habit grown since the dread disease struck her much fear and the fear was but another form of the maternal love though they were healed in person the taint of the scour ge might be in their garments ready communication he had such thought they were before him he had called them they had answ ered who or what should keep them from him now next moment the three so long separated were mingling their tears in each other s project gutenberg https ﬁrst ecstasy over the mother said in this happiness my children let us not be ungrateful let us begin life anew by acknowledgment of him to whom we are all so they fell upon their knees amrah with the rest and the prayer of the elder outspoken was psalm tirzah repeated it word word so did but not with the same clear mind and questionless faith when they were risen he asked in nazareth where the man was born mother they call him the son of carpenter what is he her eyes rested upon him with all their old tenderness and she answered she had answered the nazarene he is the and whence has he his power we may know by the use he makes of it can you tell any ill he has done by that sign then i answer he has his power from it is not an easy thing to shake off in moment the expectations nurtured through years until they have become essentially part of us and though asked himself what the vanities of the world were to such one his ambition was obdurate and would not down he persisted men yet every day in measuring the christ by himself how much better if we measured ourselves by the christ naturally the mother was the ﬁrst to think of the cares of life what shall we now my son where shall we go then recalled to duty observed how completely every trace of the scour ge had disappeared from his restored people that each had back her perfection of person that with naaman when he came up out of the water their ﬂesh had come again like unto the ﬂesh of little child and he took off his cloak and threw it over tirzah take it he said smiling the eye of the stranger would have shunned you before now it shall not of fend the act exposed sword belted to his side is it time of war asked the mother anxiously why then are you armed it may be necessary to defend the thus evaded the whole truth has he enemies who are they alas mother they are not all romans is he not of israel and man of peace there was never one more so but in the opinion of the rabbis and teachers he is guilty of great what crime in his eyes the uncircumcised gentile is worthy favor jew of the strictest habit he preaches new the mother was silent and they moved to the shade of the tree by the rock calming his impatience to have them home again and hear their story he showed them the necessity of obedience to project gutenberg https governing in cases like theirs and in conclusion called the arab bidding him take the horses to the gate by bethesda and await him there whereupon they set out by the way of the mount of offence the return was very different from the coming they walked rapidly and with ease and in good time reached tomb newly made near that of absalom overlooking the depths of cedron finding it unoccupied the women took possession while he went on hastily to make the preparat ions required their new project gutenberg https v pitched two tents out on the upper cedron east short space of the tombs of the kings and furnished them with every comfort at his command and thither without loss of time he conducted his mother and sister to remain until the examining priest could certify their perfect cleansing in course of the duty the young man had subjected himself to such serious deﬁlement to debar him from participation in the ceremonies of the great feast then near at hand he could not enter the least sacred of the courts of the temple of necessity not less than choice therefore he stayed at the tents with his beloved people there was great deal to hear from them and great deal to tell them of himself stories such experiences extending through lapse of years sufferings of body acuter sufferings of usually long in the telling the incidents seldom following each other in threaded connection he listen ed to the narrative and all they told him with outward patience masking inward feeling in fact his hatred of rome and romans reached higher mark than ever his desire vengeance became thirst which attempts at reﬂection only intensiﬁed in the almost savage bitterness of his humor many mad impulses took hold of him the opportunities of the highways presented themselves with singular force of temptation he thought seriously of insurrection in galilee even the sea ordinarily retrospective horror to him stretched itself before his fancy laced and interlaced with lines of passage crowded with imperial plunder and imperial travellers but the better judgment matured in calmer hours was happily too ﬁrmly ﬁxed to be supplanted by present passion however strong each mental venture in reach of new expedients brought him back to the old there could be sound success except in war involving all israel in solid union and all musing upon the subject all inquiry all hope ended where they the nazarene and his purposes at odd moments the excited scheme r found pleasure in fashioning speech that person hear israel i am he the promised of god born king of the to you with the dominion spoken of by the prophets rise now and lay hold on the world would the nazarene but speak these few words what tumult would follow how many mouths performing the ofﬁce of trumpets would take them up and blow them abroad the massing of armies would he speak them and eager to begin the work and answe ring in the worldly way lost sight of the double nature of the man and of the other possibility that the divine in him might transcend the human in the miracle of which tirzah and his mother were the witnesses even more nearly than himself he saw and set apart and dwelt upon power ample enough to raise and support jewish project gutenberg https the wrecks of the italian and more than ample to remodel society and convert mankind into one puriﬁed happy family and when that work was done could any one say the peace which might then be ordered without hindrance was not mission worthy son of god could any one then deny the redeemership of the christ and discarding all consideration of political consequences what unspeakable personal glory there would then be to him man it was not in the nature of any mere mortal to refuse such career meantime down the cedron and in towards bezetha especially on the roadsides quite up to the damascus gate the country ﬁlled rapidly with all kinds of temporary shelters pilgrims to the passover visited the strangers and talked with them and returning to his tents he was each time more and more astonished at the vastness of their numbers and when he further discovered that every part of the world was represented among upon both shores of the mediterranean far off the pillars of the west in distant india provinces in northernmost europe and that though they frequently saluted him with tongues unacquainted with syllable of the old hebrew of the fathers these representatives had all the same of the notable idea tinged mistily with superstitious fancy forced itself upon him might he not after all have misunderstood the nazarene might not that perso n by patient waiting be covering silent preparation and proving his ﬁtness the glorious task before him how much better this time the movement than that other when by gennesaret the galileans would have forced assumption of the crown then the support would have been limited to few thousands now his proclamation would be responded to by could say how many pursuing this theory to its conclusions moved amidst brilliant promises and glowed with the thought that the melancholy man under gentle seeming and wondrous was in fact carrying in disguise the subtlety of politician and the genius of soldier several times also in the meanwhile brawny men bareheaded and came and asked at the tent his interviews with them were always apart and to his mother s question who they were he answered some good friends of mine from through them he kept informed of the movements of the nazarene and of the schemes of the nazarene s enemies rabbinical and roman that the good man s life was in danger he knew but that there were any bold enough to attempt to take it at that time he could not believe it seem ed too securely intrenched in great fame and an assured popularity the very vastness of the attendance in and about the city brought with it seeming guaranty of safety and yet to say truth s conﬁdence rested most certainly upon the miraculous power of the christ pondering the subject in the purely human view that the master of such authority over life and death used so frequently the good of others would not exert it in care of himself was simply much past belief it was past understanding nor should it be forgotten that all these were incidents of occurrence between the day of by the modern the the evening of project gutenberg https day yielded to his impatience and rode to the city leaving behind him promise to return in the night the horse was fresh and choosing his own gait sped swiftly the eyes of the clambering vines winked at the rider from the garden fences on the way there was nothing else to see him nor child nor woman nor man through the rocky ﬂoat in the hollows of the road the agate hoofs drummed ringing like cups of steel but without notice from any stranger in the houses passed there were tenants the ﬁres by the were out the road was deserted this was the ﬁrst passover eve and the hour between the evenings when the visiting millions crowded the city and the slaughter of lambs in offering reeked the of the temple and the priests in ordered lines caught the ﬂowing blood and carried it swiftly to the dripping all was haste and hurry racing with the stars fast coming with the signal after which the roasting and the eating and the singi ng might go on but not the preparation more through the great northern gate the rider rode and lo jerusalem before the fall in ripeness of glory illuminated the project gutenberg https vi alighted at the gate of the khan from which the three wise men more than thirty years before departed going down to bethlehem there in keeping of his arab followers he left the horse and shortly after was at the wicket of his father s house and in yet briefer space in the great chamber he called malluch ﬁrst that worthy being out he sent salutation to his friends the merchant and the egyptian they were being carried abroad to see the celebration the latter he was informed was very feeble and in state of deep dejection young people of that time who were supposed hardly to know their own hearts indulged the habit of politic indirection quite much young people in the same condition indulge it in this time so when inquired the good balthasar and with grave courtesy desired to know if he would be pleased to see him he really addressed the daughter notice of his arrival while the servant was answering the elder the curtain of the doorway was drawn aside and the younger egyptian came in and or ﬂoated upborne in white cloud of the gauzy raiment she so loved and lived the centre of the chamber where the light cast by lamps from the brazen stick planted upon the ﬂoor was the strongest with her there was fear of light the servant left the two alone in the excitement occasioned by the events of the few days past had scarcely given thought to the fair egyptian if she came to his mind at all it was merely briefest pleasure suggestion of delight which could wait him and was waiting but now the inﬂuence of the woman revived with all its force the instant beheld her he advanced to her eagerly but stopped and gazed such change he had never seen theretofore she had been lover studious to win manner all warmth each glance an admission each action an avowal she had showered him with incense of ﬂattery while he was present she had impressed him with her admiration going away he carried the impression with him to remain delicious expectancy hastening his return it was him the painted eyelids drooped lowest over the lustrous almond eyes him the stories caught from the professionals abounding in the streets of alexandria were repeated with emphasis and lavishment of poetry him endless exclamations of sympa thy and smiles and little privileges with hand and hair and cheek and lips and songs of the nile and displays of jewelry and subtleties of lace in veils and scarfs and other subtleties not less exquisite in ﬂosses of indian silk the idea old the oldest of peoples that beauty is the reward of the hero had never such realism she contrived his pleasure insomuch that he could not doubt he was her hero she avouched it in thousand artful ways natural with her her ways reserved it would seem by the passionate genius of old egypt its daughters such the egyptian had been to from the night of the on the lake in the orchard of palms but now project gutenberg https in this volume the reader may have observed term of somewhat indeﬁnite meaning used reverently in sacred connection we repeat it now with general application there are few persons who have not double nature the real and the acquired the latter kind of addendum resulting from education which in time often perfects it into part of the being unquestionable the ﬁrst leaving the thought to the thoughtful we proceed to say that now the real nature of the egyptian made itself manifest it was not possible her to have received stranger with repulsion more incisive yet she was apparently passionless statue only the small head was little tilted the nostrils little drawn and the sensuous lower lip pushed the upper the least bit out of its natural curvature she was the ﬁrst to speak your coming is timely son of hur she said in voice sharply distinct i wish to thank you hospitality after morrow i may not have the opportunity to bowed slightly without taking his eyes from her i have heard of custom which the observe with good result among themselves she continued when the game is over they refer to their tablets and cast up their accounts then they libate the gods and put crown upon the happy winner we have had has lasted through many days and nights why now that it is at an end shall not we see to which the chaplet belongs yet very watchful answered lightly man may not balk woman bent on having her way tell she continued inclining her head and permitting the sneer to become tell prince of jerusalem where is he that son of the carpenter of nazareth and son not less of god from whom so lately such mighty things were expected he waved his hand impatiently and replied i am not his keeper the beautiful head sank forward yet lower has he broken rome to pieces again but with anger raised his hand in deprecation where has he seated his capital she proceeded can not i go see his throne and its lions of bronze and his raised the dead and to such one what is it to raise golden house he has but to stamp his foot and say the word and the house is pillared like karnak and wanting there was by this time slight ground left to believe her playing the questions were offensive and her manner pointed with unfriendliness seeing which he on his side became more wary and said with good humor egypt let us wait another day even another week him the lions and the she went on without noticing the suggestion and how is it i see you in that garb such is not the habit of governors in india or elsew here i saw the satrap of teheran once and he wore turban of silk and cloak of cloth of gold and the hilt and scabbard of his sword made dizzy with their splendor of precious stones i thought osiris had lent him project gutenberg https from the sun i fear you have not entered upon your kingdom kingdom i was to share with the daughter of my wise guest is kinder than she imagines herself she is teaching that isis may kiss heart without making it better spoke with cold courtesy and iras after playing with the pendent solitaire of her necklace of coins rejoined jew the son of hur is clever i saw your dreaming cæsar make his entry into jerusalem you told us he would that day proclaim himself king of the jews from the steps of the temple i beheld the procession descend the mountain bringing him i heard their singing they were beautiful with palms in motion i looked everywhere among them ﬁgure with promise of horseman in purple chariot with driver in shining brass stately warrior behind an orbed shield rivalling his spear in stature i looked his guard it would have been pleasant to have seen prince of jerusalem and cohort of the legions of she ﬂung her listener glance of provoking disdain then laughed heartily if the ludicrousness of the picture in her mind were too strong contempt instead of sesostris returning in triumph or cæsar helmed and ha ha saw man with woman s face and hair riding an ass s colt and in tears the king the son of god the redeemer of the world ha ha ha in spite of himself winced i did not quit my place prince of jerusalem she said before he could recover i did not laugh i said to myself wait in the temple he will glorify himself becomes hero about to take possession of the i saw him enter the gate of shushan and the court of the women i saw him stop and stand before the gate beautiful there were people with on the porch and in the courts and on the cloisters and on the steps of the three sides of the temple there were other will say million of people all waiting breathlessly to hear his proclamation the pillars were not more still than we ha ha ha i fancied i heard the axles of the mighty roman machine begin to crack ha ha ha prince by the soul of solomon your king of the world drew his gown about him and walked away and out by the farthest gate nor opened his mouth to say word roman machine is running yet in simple homage to hope that instant hope which it began to fall and while it was falling he unconsciously followed with parting look down to its lowered his eyes at previous time whether when balthasar was plying him with arguments or when miracles were being done before his face had the disputed nature of the nazarene been so plainly set before him the best way after all to reach an understanding of the divine is by study of the human in the things superior to men we may always look to ﬁnd god so with the picture given by the egyptian of the scene when the nazarene turned from the gate beautiful its central theme was an act utterly beyond performance by man under control of merely huma n inspirations parable to people it taught what the christ had so often his mission was not political there was not much more time thought of all this than that allowed common respiration yet the idea took fast hold of and in the project gutenberg https he followed his hope of vengeance out of sight and the man with the woman s face and hair and in tears came near to enough to leave something of his spirit behind daughter of balthasar he said with dignity if this be the game of which you spoke to take the accord it yours only let us make an end of words that you have purpose i am sure to it i pray and i will answer you then let us go our several ways and forget we ever met say on i will listen but not to more of that which you have given she regarded him intently moment if determining what to she might have been measuring his she said coldly you have my peace to you he responded and walked away he was about passing out of the door she called to him he stopped where he was and looked back consider all i know about most fair egyptian he said returning what all you know about she looked at him absently you are more of roman son of hur then any of your hebrew am i so unlike my countrymen he asked indif ferently the are all roman now she rejoined and therefore you will tell what more you know about the likeness is not lost upon it might induce to save save the ﬁngers toyed daintily with the lustrous pendant at the throat and her voice was excee ding low and soft only tapping on the ﬂoor with her silken sandal admonished him to have care there was jew an escaped who killed man in the palace of idernee she began slowly was startled the same jew slew roman soldier before the here in jerusalem the same jew has three trained legions from galilee to seize the roman governor the same jew has alliances perfected war upon rome and ilderim the sheik is one of his drawing nearer him she almost whispered you have lived in rome suppose these things repeated in ears we know of ah you change color he drew back from her with somewhat of the look which may be imagined upon the face of man who thinking to play with kitten has run upon tiger and she proceeded you are acquainted in the antechamb er and know the lord sejanus suppose it were told him with the proofs in without the the same jew is the richest man in the in all the empire the ﬁshes of the tiber would have fattening other than that they dig out of its ooze would they not and while they were son of hur project gutenberg https would be on exhibition in the circus amusing the roman people is ﬁne art getting the money to keep them amused is another art even ﬁner and was there ever an artist the equal of the lord sejanus was not too much stirred by the evident baseness of the woman recollection not unfrequently when all the other faculties are numb and failing memory does its ofﬁces with the greatest ﬁdelity the scene at the spring on the way to the jordan reproduced itself and he remembered thinking then that esther had betrayed him and thinking so now he said calmly he could to give you pleasure daughter of egypt i acknowledge your cunning and that i am at your mercy it may also please you to hear acknowledge i have hope of your favor i could kill you but you are woman the desert is open to receive and though rome is good hunter of men there she would follow long and far before she caught in its heart there are wildernesses of spears well wildernesses of sand and it is not unlovely to the unconquered parthian in the toils i that i have there is one thing my due who told you all you know about in ﬂight or captivity dying even there will be consolation in leaving the traitor the curse of man who has lived knowing nothing but wretchedness who told you all you know about it might have been touch of art or might have been that it expression of the egyptian s face became sympathetic there are in my country son of hur she said presently workmen who make pictures by gathering shells here and there on the after storms and cutting them up and patching the pieces inlaying on marble slabs can you not see the hint there is in the practice to such go searching secrets enough that from this person i gathered handful of little circumstances and from that other yet another handful and that afterwhile i put them together and was happy woman can be who has at disposal the fortune and life of man whom stopped and beat the ﬂoor with her foot and looked away if to hide sudden emotion from him with an air of even painful resolution she presently ﬁnished the whom she is at loss what to it is not enough said unmoved by the it is not enough you will determine what to with i may true she rejoined quickly and with emphasis i had something from sheik ilderim he lay with my father in grove out in the desert the night was still very still and the walls of the tent sooth to say were poor ward against ears outside listening to and beetles ﬂying through the air she smiled at the conceit but proceeded some other of shell the had from whom the son of hur was there other who contributed not project gutenberg https drew breath of relief and said lightly thanks it were not well to keep the lord sejanus waiting you the desert is not so sensitive again egypt peace to this time he had been standing unco vered now he took the handkerchief from his arm where it had been hanging and adjusting it upon his head turned to depart but she arrested him in her eagerness she even reached hand to him stay she said he looked back at her but without taking the hand though it was very noticeable its sparkling of jewels and he knew by her manner that the reserved point of the scene which was so surprising to him was now to come stay and not distrust son of hur if i declare i know why the noble arrius took you his heir and by isis by all the gods of egypt i swear i tremble to think of you so brave and generous under the hand of the remorseless minister you have left

conquest of himself and that prince is what i have to ask of she spoke rapidly and with animation indeed she had never appeared to him so fascinating you had once friend she continued it was in your boyhood there was quarrel and you and he became enemies he did you wrong after many years you met him again in the circus at messala yes messala you are his creditor forgive the past admit him to friendship again restore the fortune he lost in the great wager rescue him the six talents are nothing to you not so much bud lost upon tree already in full leaf but to ah he must go about with broken body wherever you meet him he must look up to you from the ground noble prince to roman descended he is beggary is the other most odious name death save him from beggary if the rapidity with which she spoke was cunning invention to keep him from thinking either she never knew or else had forgotten that there are convictions which derive nothing from thought but drop into place without leave or notice it seemed to him when at last she paused to have his answer that he could see messala himself peering at him over her shoulder and in its expression the countenance of the roman was not that of mendicant or friend the sneer was patrician ever and the ﬁne edge of the hauteur ﬂawless and irritating the appeal has been decided then and once messala takes nothing i must go and write it in my book of great project gutenberg https by roman against roman but did messala send you to with this request egypt he has noble nature and judged you by took the hand upon arm you know him in such friendly way fair egyptian tell would he there being reversal of the conditions that he asks of answer by isis answer the truth s sake there was insistence in the touch of his hand and in his look also oh she began he roman you were about to say meaning that i jew must not determine dues from to him by any measure of dues from him to being jew i must forgive him my winnings because he is roman if you have more to tell daughter of balthasar speak quickly quickly by the lord god of israel when this heat of blood hotter waxing attains its highest i may not be able longer to see that you are woman and beautiful i may see but the spy of master the more hateful because the master is roman say on and quickly she threw his hand off and stepped back into the full light with all the evil of her nature collected in her eyes and voice thou drinker of lees feeder upon husks to think i could love thee having seen messala such thou were born to serve him he would have been satisﬁed with release of the six talents but i say to the six thou shalt add enty dost thou hear the kissings of my little ﬁnger which thou hast taken from him though with my consent shall be paid and that i have followed thee with affection of sympathy and endured thee so long enter into the account not less because i was servi ng him the merchant here is thy keeper of moneys if by at noon he has not thy order acted upon in favor of my messala talents the sum shalt settle with the lord sejanus be wise she was going to the door he put himself in her way the old egypt lives in you he said whether you see messala or the next day here or in rome give him this message tell him i have back the money even the six talents he robbed of by robbing my father s estate tell him i survived the galleys to which he had sent and in my strength rejoice in his beggary and dishonor tell him i think the afﬂiction of body which he has from my hand is the curse of our lord god of israel upon him more ﬁt than death his crimes against the helpless tell him my mother and sister whom he had sent to cell in antonia that they might die of leprosy are alive and well thanks to the power of the nazarene whom you so despise tell him that to ﬁll my measure of happiness they are restored to and that i will go hence to their love and ﬁnd in it more than compensation the impure passions which you leave to take to him tell your comfort cunning incarnate much him that when the lord sejanus comes to despoil he will ﬁnd nothing the inheritance i had from the duumvir including the villa by misenum has been sold and the money from the sale is out of reach aﬂoat in the marts of the world bills of exchange and that this house and the goods and merchandise and the ships and caravans with which simonides plies his commerce with such princely proﬁts are covered by imperial wise project gutenberg https found the price of the favor and the lord sejanus preferring reasonable gain in the way of gift to much gain ﬁshed from pools of blood and wrong tell him if all this were not so if the money and property were all mine yet should he not have the least part of it when he ﬁnds our jewish bills and forces them to give up their values there is yet another resort left deed of gift to much egypt i found out in the atria of the great capital tell him that along with my deﬁance i not send him curse in words but better expression of my undying hate i send him one who will prove to him the sum of all curses and when he looks at you repeating this my message daughter of balthasar his roman shrewdness will tell him all i mean go now i will he conducted her to the door and with ceremonious politeness held back the curtain while she passed out peace to you he said she project gutenberg https vii when left the there was not nearly so much life in his action when he entered it his steps were slower and he went along with his head quite upon his breast having made discovery that man with broken back may yet have sound brain he was reﬂecting upon the discovery forasmuch it is easy after calamity has befallen to look back and see the proofs of its coming strewn along the way the thought that he had not even suspected the egyptian in messala s interest but had gone blindly on through whole years putting himself and his friends more and more at her mercy was sore wound to the young man s vanity i remember he said to himself she had word of indignation the perﬁdious roman at the fountain of castalia i remember she extolled him at the on the lake in the orchard of palms and ah stopped and beat his left hand violently with his ah that mystery about the appointment she made with at the palace of idernee is mystery now the wound it should be observed was to his vanity and fortunately it is not often that people die of such hurts or even continue long time sick in s case moreover there was compensation presently he exclaimed aloud praised be the lord god that the woman took not more lasting hold on i see i did not love her then if he had already parted with not little of the weight on his mind he stepped forward more lightly and coming to the place on the terrace where one stairway led down to the below and another ascended to the roof he took the latter and began to climb he made the last step in the ﬂight he stopped again can balthasar have been her partner in the long mask she has been playing hypocrisy seldom goes with wrinkled age like that balthasar is good with this decided opinion he stepped upon the roof there was full moon overhead yet the vault of the sky at the moment was lurid with light cast up from the ﬁres burning in the streets and open places of the city and the chanting and chorusing of the old psalmody of israel ﬁlled it with plaintive harmonies to which he could not but listen the countless voices bearing the burden seemed to say thus son of judah we prove our worshipfulness of the lord god and our loyalty to the land he gave us let gideon appear or david or maccabaeus and we are ready that seemed an introduction next he saw the man of nazareth in certain moods the mind is disposed to mock itself with inapposite fancies the tearful face of the christ stayed with him while he crossed the roof to the parapet above the street on the north side of the house and there was in it sign of war but rather project gutenberg https of calm evenings look peace upon everything so it looked provoking the old question what manner of man is he permitted himself one glance over the parapet then turned and walked mechanically towards the summer let them their worst he said he went slowly on i will not forgive the roman i will not divide my fortune with him nor will i ﬂy from this city of my fathers i will call on galilee ﬁrst and here make the ﬁght by brave deeds i will bring the tribes to our side he who raised up moses will ﬁnd us leader if i fail if not the nazarene then some other of the many ready to die the interior of the summer when slow sauntering came to it was murkily lighted the faintest of shadows lay along the ﬂoor from the pillars on the north and west sides looking in he saw the usually occupied by simonides drawn to spot from which view of the city over towards the could be best had the good man is returned i will speak with him unless he be he walked in and with quiet step approached the chair peering over the high back he beheld esther nestled in the seat small ﬁgure snugged away under her father s the hair dishevelled fell over her face her breathing was low and irregular once it was broken by long sigh ending in sob might have been the sigh or the loneliness in which he found to him the idea that the sleep was rest from sorrow rather than fatigue nature kindly sends such relief to children and he was used to thinking esther scarcely more than child he put his arms upon the back of the chair and thought i will not wake her i have nothing to tell unless it be my love she is daughter of judah and beautiful and so unlike the egyptian there it is all vanity here all truth there ambition here duty there selﬁsh ness here nay the question is not i love her but does she love she was my friend from the beginning the night on the terrace at antioch how she begged not to make rome my enemy and had tell her of the villa by misenum and of the life there that she should not see i saw her cunning drift i kissed her can she have forgotten the kiss i have not i love her they not know in the city that i have back my people i shrank from telling it to the egyptian but this little one will rejoice with over their restoration and welcome them with love and sweet services of hand and heart she will be to my mother another daughter in tirzah she will ﬁnd her other self i would wake her and tell her these things on the sorceress of egypt of that folly i could not command myself to speak i will go away and wait another and better time i will wait fair esther dutiful child daughter of judah he retired silently he project gutenberg https viii the streets were full of people going and coming or grouped about the ﬁres roasting meat and feasting and singing and happy the odor of scorching ﬂesh mixed with the odor of cedar aﬂame and smoking loaded the air and this was the occasion when every son of israel was full brother to every other son of israel and hospitality was without bounds was saluted at every step while the groups by the ﬁres insisted stay and partake with us we are brethren in the love of the but with thanks to them he hurried on intending to take horse at the khan and return to the tents on the cedron to make the place it was necessary him to cross the thoroughfare so soon to receive sorrowful christian perpetuation there also the pious celebration was at its height looking up the street he noticed the ﬂames of torches in motion streaming out like pennons then he observed that the singing ceased where the torches came his wonder rose to its highest however when he became certain that amidst the smoke and dancing sparks he saw the keener sparkling of burnished spear arguing the presence of roman soldiers what were they the scofﬁng legionaries doing in jewish religious procession the circumstance was unheard of and he stayed to see the meaning of it the moon was shining its best yet if the moon and the torches and the ﬁres in the street and the rays streaming from windows and open doors were not enough to make the way clear some of the processionists carried lighte d lanterns and fancying he discovered special purpose in the use of such equipments hur stepped into the street so close to the line of march to bring every one of the company under view while passing the torches and the lanterns were being borne by servants each of whom was armed with bludgeon or sharpened stave their present duty seemed to be to pick out the smoothest paths among the rocks in the street certain dignitaries among and priests rabbis with long beards heavy brows and beaked noses men of the class potential in the councils of caiaphas and hannas where could they be going not to the temple certainly the route to the sacred house from zion whence these appeared to be coming was by the xystus and their peaceful why the soldiers the procession began to go by his attention was particularly called to three persons walking together they were well towards the front and the servants who went before them with lanterns appeared unusually careful in the service in the person moving on the left of this group he recognized chief policeman of the temple the one on the right was priest the middle man was not at ﬁrst so easily placed he walked leaning heavily upon the arms of the others and carried his head so low upon his breast to hide his face his appearance was that of prisoner not yet recovered from the fright of arrest or being taken to something torture or death the dignitaries helping him on the right and left and the attention they gave him made project gutenberg https that if he were not himself the object moving the party he was at least in some way connected with the witness or guide possibly an informer so if it could be found who he was the business in hand might be shrewdly guessed with great assurance fell in on the right of the priest and walked along with him now if the man would lift his head and presently he did so letting the light of the lanterns strike full in his face pale dazed pinched with dread the beard roughed the eyes ﬁlmy sunken and despairing in much going about following the nazarene had come to know his disciples well the master and now at sight of the dismal countenance he cried out the scariot slowly the head of the man turned until his eyes settled upon and his lips moved if he were about to speak but the priest interfered who art thou begone he said to pushing him away the young man took the push and waiting an opportunity fell into the procession again thus he was carried passively along down the street through the crowded lowlands between the hill bezetha and the castle of antonia and on by the bethesda reservoir to the sheep gate there were people everywhere and everywhere the people were engaged in sacred observances it being passover night the valves of the gate stood open the keepers were off somewhere feasting in front of the procession it passed out unchallenged was the deep gorge of the cedron with olivet beyond its dressing of cedar and olive trees darker of the moonlight silvering all the heavens two roads met and merged into the street at the from the northeast the other from bethany ere could ﬁnish wondering whether he were to go farther and if so which road was to be taken he was led off down into the gorge and still hint of the purpose of the midnight march down the gorge and over the bridge at the bottom of it there was great clatter on the ﬂoor the crowd now straggling rabble passed over beating and poun ding with their clubs and staves little farther and they turned off to the left in the direction of an olive orchard enclosed by stone wall in view from the road knew there was nothing in the place but old gnarled trees the grass and trough hewn out of rock the treading of oil after the fashion of the country while yet more wonder he was thinking what could bring such company at such an hour to quarter so lonesome they were all brought to standstill voices called out excitedly in front chill sensation ran from man to man there was rapid and blind stumbling over each other the soldiers alone kept their order it took but moment to disengage himself from the mob and run forward there he found gateway without gate admitting to the orchard and he halted to take in the scene man in white clothes and bareheaded was standing outside the entrance his hands crossed before slender stooping ﬁgure with long hair and thin an attitude of resignation and waiting it was the nazarene project gutenberg https him next the gateway were the disciples in group they were excited but man was ever calmer than he the torchlight beat redly upon him giving his hair tint ruddier than was natural to it yet the expression of the countenance was usual all gentleness and pity opposite this most unmartial ﬁgure stood the rabble gaping silent awed at sign of anger from him to break and run and from him to at judas conspicuous in their quick glance and the object of the visit lay open to his understanding here was the betrayer there the betrayed and these with clubs and staves and the legionaries were brought to take him man may not always tell what he will until the trial is upon him this was the emer gency which had been years preparing the man to whose security he had devoted himself and upon whose life he had been building so largely was in personal peril yet he stood still such contradictions are there in human nature to say truth reader he was not entirely recovered from the picture of the christ before the gate beautiful it had been given by the egyptian and besides that the very calmness with which the mysterious person confronted the mob held him in restraint by suggesting the possession of power in reserve more than sufﬁcient the peril peace and and love and had been the burden of the nazarene s teaching would he put his preaching into practice he was master of life he could restore it when lost he could take it at pleasure what use would he make of the power now defend himself and how thought were sufﬁcient that there would be some signal exhibition of astonishing force beyond the natural believed and in that faith waited and in all this he was still measuring the nazarene by the human standard presently the clear voice of the christ arose whom seek ye jesus of nazareth the priest replied i am at these simplest of words spoken without passion or alarm the assailants fell back several steps the timid among them cowering to the ground and they might have let him alone and gone away had not judas walked over to him hail master with this friendly speech he kissed him judas said the nazarene mildly betrayest thou the son of man with kiss wherefore art thou come receiving reply the master spoke to the crowd again whom seek ye jesus of i have told you that i am he if therefore you seek let these go their way at these words of entreaty the rabbis advanced upon him and seeing their intent some of the disciples whom he interceded drew nearer one of them cut off man s ear but without saving the master from being taken and yet stood still nay while the ofﬁcers were making ready with their ropes the project gutenberg https doing his greatest the greatest in deed but the very greatest in illustration of his forbearance so far surpassing that of men suffer ye thus far he said to the wounded man and healed him with touch both friends and enemies were side that he could such thing the other that he would it under the circumstances surely he will not allow them to bind him thus thought put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my father hath given shall i not drink it from the offending follower the nazarene turned to his captors are you come out against thief with swords and staves to take i was daily with you in the temple and you took not but this is your hour and the power of the posse plucked up courage and closed about him and when looked the faithful they were one of them remained the crowd about the deserted man seemed very busy with tongue hand and foot over their heads between the through the smoke sometimes in openings between the restless men caught momentary glimpses of the prisoner never had anything struck him so piteous so unfriended so forsaken yet he thought the man could have defended could have slain his enemies with breath but he would not what was the cup his father had given him to drink and who was the father to be so obeyed mystery upon one but many directly the mob started in return to the city the soldiers in the lead became anxious he was not satisﬁed with himself where the torches were in the midst of the rabble he knew the nazarene was to be found suddenly he resolved to see him again he would ask him one question taking off his long outer garment and the handkerchief from his head he threw them upon the orchard wall and started after the posse which he boldly joined throug h the stragglers he made way and by littles at length reached the man who carried the ends of the rope with which the prisoner was bound the nazarene was walking slowly his head down his hands bound behind him the hair fell thickly over his face and he stooped more than usual apparently he was oblivious to all going on around him in advance few steps were priests and elders talking and occasionally looking back when at length they were all near the bridge in the gorge took the rope from the servant who had it and stepped past him master master he said hurriedly speaking close to the nazarene s ear dost thou hear master word tell the fellow from whom he had taken the rope now claimed it tell continued goest thou with these of thine own accord the people were come up now and in his own ears asking angrily who art thou man project gutenberg https master made haste to say his voice sharp with anxiety i am thy friend and lover tell i pray thee if i bring rescue wilt thou accept it the nazarene never so much looked up or allowed the slightest sign of recognition yet the something which when we are suffering is always telling it to such look at us though they be strangers failed not now let him alone it seemed to say he has been abandoned by his friends the world has denied him in bitterness of spirit he has taken farewell of men he is going he knows not where and he cares not let him and to that was now driven dozen hands were upon him and from all sides there was shou ting he is one of them bring him along club him with gust of passion which gave him many times his ordinary force raised himself turned once about with arms outstretched shook the hands off and rushed through the circle which was fast hemming him in the hands snatching at him he passed tore his garments from his back so he ran off the road naked and the gorge in keeping of the friendly darkness darker there than elsewhere received him safe reclaiming his handkerchief and outer garments from the orchard wall he followed back to the city gate thence he went to the khan and on the good horse rode to the tents of his people out by the tombs of the kings he rode he promised himself to see the nazarene on the it not knowing that the unfriended man was taken straightway to the house of hannas to be tried that night the heart the young man carried to his couch beat so heavily he could not sleep now clearly his renewed judean kingdom resolved itself into what it dream it is bad enough to see our castles overthrown one after another with an interval between in which to recover from the shock or at least let the echoes of the fall die away but when they go ships sink houses tumble in spirits which endure it calmly are made of stuffs sterner than common and hur s was not of them through vistas in the future he began to catch glimpses of life serenely beautiful with home instead of palace of state and esther its mistress again and again through the hours of the night he saw the villa by misenum and with his little countrywoman strolled through the garden and rested in the panelled atrium overhead the neapolitan sky at their feet the sunniest of and the bluest of bays in plainest speech he was entering upon crisis with which morrow and the nazarene will have everything to project gutenberg https ix next morning about the second hour two men rode full speed to the doors of s tents and dismounting asked to see him he was not yet risen but gave directions their admission peace to you brethren he said they were of his galileans and trusted ofﬁcers w ill you be seated nay the senior replied bluntly to sit and be at ease is to let the nazarene die rise son of judah and go with us the judgment has been given the tree of the cross is already at stared at them the cross was all he could the moment say they took him last night and tried him the man continued at dawn they led him before pilate twice the roman denied his guilt twice he refused to give him over at last he washed his hands and said be it upon you then and they who answered priests and his blood be upon us and our holy father abraham cried roman kinder to an israelite than his own kin and if he should indeed be the son of god what shall ever wash his blood from their children it must not tis time to ﬁght his face brightened with resolution and he clapped his hands the quickly he said to the arab who answered the signal and bid amrah send fresh garments and bring my sword it is time to die israel my friends tarry without till i he ate crust drank cup of wine and was soon upon the road whither would you go ﬁrst asked the galilean to collect the alas the man replied throwing up his hands why alas master man spoke with master i and my friend here are all that are faithful the rest follow the seeking what and drew rein to kill not the nazarene you have said looked slowly from one man to the other he was hearing again the question of the night before the cup my father hath given shall i not drink it in the ear of the nazarene he was putting his own question if i bring thee rescue wilt thou accept it he was saying to himself this death may not be averted the man has been travelling towards it with full knowledge from the day he began his mission it is imposed by will higher than his whose but the lord s if he is consenting if project gutenberg https to it voluntarily what shall another nor less did hur see the failure of the scheme he had built upon the ﬁdelity of the galileans their desertion in fact left nothing more of it but how singular it should happen that morning of all others dread seized him it was possible his scheming and labor and expenditure of treasure might have been but blasphemous contention with god when he picked up the reins and said let us go brethren all before him was uncertainty the faculty of resolving quickly without which one can not be hero in the midst of stirring scenes was numb within him let us go brethren let us to they passed through excited crowds of people going south like themselves all the country north of the city seemed aroused and in motion hearing that the procession with the condemned might be met with somewhere near the great white towers left by herod the three friends rode thither passing round southeast of akra in the valley below the pool of hezekiah against the multitude became impossible and they were compelled to dismount and take shelter behind the corner of house and wait the waiting was if they were on river bank watching ﬂood go by such the people seemed there are certain chapters in the first book of this story which were written to give the reader an idea of the composition of the jewish nationality it was in the time of christ they were also written in anticipation of this hour and scene so that he who has read them with attention can now see all saw of the going to the rare and wonderful sight half an ﬂood surged by and his companions within arm s reach incessant undiminished at the end of that time he could have said i have seen all the castes of jerusalem all the sects of judea all the tribes of israel and all the nationalities of earth represented by the libyan jew went by and the jew of egypt and the jew from the rhine in short jews from all east countries and all west countries and all islands within commercial connection they went by on foot on horseback on camels in litters and chariots and with an inﬁnite variety of costumes yet with the same marvellous similitude of features which particularizes the children of israel tried they have been by climates and modes of life they went by speaking all known tongues by that means only were they distinguishable group from group they went by in anxious to behold one poor nazarene die felon between felons these were the many but they were not all borne along with the stream were thousands not thousands hating and despising romans arabs syrians africans egyptians easterns so that studying the mass it seemed the whole world was to be represented and in that sense present at the cruciﬁxion the going was singularly quiet upon rock the glide and rattle of revolving wheels voices in conversation and now and then calling voice were all the sounds heard above the rustle of the mighty movement yet was there upon every countenance the look with which men make haste to see some dreadful sight some sudden wreck or ruin or calamity of project gutenberg https by such signs judged that these were the strangers in the city come up to the passover who had had part in the trial of the nazarene and might be his friends at length from the direction of the great towers heard at ﬁrst faint in the distance shouting of many men hark they are coming now said one of his friends the people in the street halted to hear but the cry rang on over their heads they looked at each other and in shuddering silence moved along the shouting drew nearer each moment and the air was already full of it and trembling when saw the servants of simonides coming with their master in his chair and esther walking by his side covered litter was next behind them peace to you to you esther said hur meeting them if you are golgotha stay until the procession passes i will then go with you there is room to turn in by the house the merchant s large head rested heavily upon his breast rousing himself he answered speak to balthasar his pleasure will be mine he is in the litter hastened to draw aside the curtain the egyptian was lying within his wan face so pinched to appear like dead man the proposal was submitted to him can we see him he inquired faintly the nazarene yes he must pass within few feet of dear lord the old man cried fervently once more once more oh it is dreadful day the world shortly the whole party were in waiting under shelter of the house they said but little afraid probably to trust their thoughts to each other everything was uncertain and nothing so much so opinions balthasar drew himself feebly from the litter and stood supported by servant esther and kept simonides company meantime the ﬂood poured along if anything more densely than before and the shouting came nearer shrill up in the air hoarse along the earth and cruel at last the procession was up see said bitterly that which cometh now is the advance was in possession of an army of boys hooting and screaming the king of the jews room room the king of the jews simonides watched them they whirle d and danced along like cloud of summer insects and said gravely when these come to their inheritance son of hur alas the city of solomon band of legionaries fully armed followed next marching in sturdy indifference the glory of burnished brass about them the while then came the nazarene he was nearly dead every few steps he staggered if he would fall stained gown badly torn hung from his shoulders over seamless undertunic his bare feet left red splotches upon the stones an inscription on board was tied to his neck crown of thorns had been crushed hard down upon his head making cruel wounds from which streams of blood now dry and blackened project gutenberg https over his face and neck the long hair tangled in the thorns was clotted thick the skin where it could be seen was ghastly white his hands were tied before him back somewhere in the city he had fallen exhausted under the transverse beam of his cross which condemned person custom required him to bear to the place of execution now countryman carried the burden in his stead four soldiers went with him guard against the mob who sometimes nevertheless broke through and struck him with sticks and spit upon him yet sound escaped him neither remonstrance nor groan nor did he look up until he was nearly in front of the house sheltering and his friends all of whom were moved with quick compassion esther clung to her father and he strong of will he was trembled balthasar fell down speechless even cried out my god my god then if he divined their feelings or heard the exclamation the nazarene turned his wan face towards the party and looked at them each one so they carried the look in memory through life they could see he was thinking of them not himself and the dying eyes gave them the blessing he was not permitted to speak where are thy legions son of hur asked simonides aroused hannas can tell thee better than what faithless all but these then all is lost and this good man must die the face of the merchant knit convulsively he spoke and his head sank upon his breast he had borne his part in s labors well and he had been inspired by the same hopes now blown out never to be rekindled two other men succeeded the nazarene bearing who are these asked of the galileans thieves appointed to die with the nazarene they replied next in the procession stalked mitred ﬁgure clad all in the golden vestments of the policemen from the temple curtained him round about and after him in order strode the sanhedrim and long array of priests the latter in their plain white garments overwrapped by abnets of many folds and gorgeous colors the of hannas said in low voice caiaphas i have seen him simonides replied adding after pause during which he thoughtfully watched the haughty pontif f and now am i convinced with such assurance proceeds from clear enlightenment of the absolute know i that he who ﬁrst goes yonder with the inscription about his neck is what the inscription proclaims of the jews common man an impostor felon was never thus waited upon look here are the israel here is the ephod here the blue robe with its fringe and purple pomegranates and golden bells not seen in the street since the day jaddua went out to meet the all that this nazarene is king would i could rise and go after him listened surprised and directly if himself awakening to his unusual display of feeling simonides said impatiently speak to balthasar i pray you and let us begone the vomit of jerusalem is project gutenberg https esther spoke i see some women there and they are weeping who are they following the pointing of her hand the party beheld four women in tears one of them leaned upon the arm of man of aspect not unlike the nazarene presently answered the man is the disciple whom the nazarene loves the best of all she who leans upon his arm is mary the master s mother the others are friendly women of esther pursued the mourners with glistening eyes until the multitude received them out of sight it may be the reader will fancy the foregoing snatches of conversation were had in quiet but it was not so the talking was the most part like that indulged by people at the seaside under the sound of the surf to nothing else can the clamor of this division of the mob be so well likened the demonstration was the forerunner of those in which scarce thirty years later under rule of the factions the holy city was torn to pieces it was quite great in numbers fanatical and bloodthirsty boiled and raved and had in it exactly the same marketmen gardeners dealers in fruits and wines proselytes and foreigners not proselytes watchmen and menials from the temple thieves robbers and the myriad not assignable to any class but who on such occasions this appeared one could say whence hungry and smelling of caves and old wretches with naked arms and legs hair and beard in uncombed mats and each with one garment the color of clay beasts with abysmal mouths in outcry effective lions calling each other across desert spaces some of them had swords greater number ﬂourished spears and javelins though the weapons of the many were staves and knotted clubs and slings which latter selected stones were stored in scrips and sometimes in sacks improv ised from the foreskirts of their dirty tunics among the mass here and there appeared persons of high elders rabbis pharisees with broad fringing sadducees in ﬁne the time prompters and directors if throat tired of one cry they invented another it if brassy lungs showed signs of collapse they set them going again and yet the clamor loud and continuous it was could have been reduced to few of the jews room the king of the jews of the temple blasphemer of god him crucify him and of these cries the last one seemed in greatest favor because doubtless it was more directly expressive of the wish of the mob and helped to better articulate its hatred of the nazarene come said simonides when balthasar was ready to proceed come let us did not hear the call the appe arance of the part of the procession then passing its brutality and hunger life were reminding him of the gentleness and the many charities he had seen him suffering men suggestions beget suggestions so he remembered suddenly his own great indebtedness to the man the time he himself was in the hands of roman guard going was supposed to death certain and almost terrible this one of the cross the cooling drink he had at the well by nazareth and the divine expression of the face of him who gave it the later goodness the miracle of project gutenberg https with these recollections the thought of his present powerlessness to give back help help or make return in kind stung him keenly and he accused himself he had not done all he might he could have watched with the galileans and kept them true and ready and this was the moment to strike blow well given now would not merely disperse the mob and set the nazarene free it would be to israel and precipitate the war freedom the opportunity was going the minutes were bearing it away and if lost god of abraham was there nothing to be that instant party of galileans caught his eye he rushed through the press and overtook them follow he said i would have speech with the men obeyed him and when they were under shelter of the house he spoke again you are of those who took my swords and agreed with to strike freedom and the king who was coming you have the swords now and now is the time to strike with them go look everywhere and ﬁnd our brethren and tell them to meet at the tree of the cross making ready the nazarene haste all of you nay stand not so the nazarene is the king and freedom dies with they looked at him respectfully but did not move hear you he asked then one of them replied son of judah that name they knew son of judah it is you who are deceived not we or our brethren who have your swords the nazarene is not the king neither has he the spirit of king we were with him when he came into jerusalem we saw him in the temple he failed himself and us and israel at the gate beautiful he turned his back upon god and refused the throne of david he is not king and galilee is not with him he shall die the death but hear you son of judah we have your swords and we are ready now to draw them and strike freedom and so is galilee be it freedom son of judah freedom and we will meet you at the tree of the the sovereign moment of his life was upon could he have taken the offer and said the word history might have been other than it is but then it would have been history ordered by men not that never was and never will be confusion fell upon him he knew not how though afterwards he attributed it to the nazarene when the nazarene was risen he understood the death was necessary to faith in the resurrection without which christianity would be an empty husk the confusion has been said left him without the faculty of decision he stood even covering his face with his hand he shook with the conﬂic t between his wish which was what he would have ordered and the power that was upon him come we are waiting you said simonides the fourth time thereupon he walked mechanically after the chair and the litter esther walked with him like balthasa r and his friends the wise men the day they went to the meeting in the desert he was being led along the way project gutenberg https x when the simonides esther and the two faithful the place of cruciﬁxion hur was in advance leading them how they had been able to make way through the great press of excited people he never knew more did he know the road by which they came or the time it took them to come he had walked in total unconsciousness neither hearing nor seeing anybody or anything and without thought of where he was going or the ghostliest semblance of purpose in his mind in such condition little child could have done much he to prevent the awful crime he was about to witness the intentions of god are always strange to us but not more so than the means by which they are wrought out and at last made plain to our belief came to stop those following him also stopped curtain rises before an audience the spell holding him in its awake rose and he saw with clear understanding there was space upon the top of low knoll rounded like skull and dry dusty and without vegetation except some scrubby hyssop the boundary of the space was living wall of men with men behind struggling some to look over others to look through it an inner wall of roman soldiery held the dense outer wall rigidly to its place centurion kept eye upon the soldiers up to the very line so vigilantly guarded had been led at the line he now stood his face to the northwest the knoll was the old aramaic latin calva ria anglicized calvary translated the skull on its slopes in the low places on the swells and higher hills the earth sparkled with strange enamelling look where he would outside the walled space he saw patch of brown soil rock green thing he saw only thousands of eyes in ruddy faces off little way in the perspective only ruddy faces without eyes off little farther only broad broad circle which the nearer view instructed him was also of faces and this was the ensemble of three millions of people under it three millions of hearts throbbing with passionate interest in what was taking place upon the knoll indifferent to the thieves caring only the nazarene and him only he was an object of hate or fear or who loved them all and was about to die them in the spectacle of great assemblage of people there are always the bewilderment and fascination one feels while looking over stretch of sea in agitation and never had this one been exceeded yet gave it but passing glance that which was going on in the space described would permit division of his interest up on the knoll so high to be above the living wall and visible over the heads of an attending company of notables conspicuous because of his mitre and vestments and his haughty air stood the high priest up the knoll still higher up quite to the round summit so to be seen far and near was the nazarene stooped and suffering but silent the wit among the guard had complemented the crown upon his head by putting reed in project gutenberg https sceptre clamors blew upon him like both together indistinguishably onl y man reader would have charged the blasts with the remainder of his love the race and let it go forever all the eyes then looking were ﬁxed upon the nazarene it may have been pity with which he was moved whatever the cause was conscious of change in his feelings conception of something better than the best of this so much better that it could serve weak man with strength to endure agonies of spirit well of body something to make death another life purer than this the which balthasar held to so fast began to dawn upon his mind clearer and clearer bringing to him certain sense that after all the mission of the nazarene was that of guide across the boundary such loved him across the boundary to where his kingdom was set up and waiting him then something borne through the air out of the almost forgotten he heard again or seemed to hear the saying of the nazarene i am the resurrection and the and the words repeated themselves over and over and took form and the dawn touched them with its light and ﬁlled them with new meaning and men repeat question to grasp and ﬁx the meaning he asked gazing at the ﬁgure on the hill fainting under its crown who the resurrection and who the life i am the ﬁgure seemed to say it him instantly he was sensible of peace such he had never peace which is the end of doubt and mystery and the beginning of faith and love and clear understanding from this dreamy state was aroused by the sound of hammering on the summit of the knoll he observed then what had escaped him soldiers and workmen preparing the crosses the holes planting the trees were ready and now the transverse beams were being ﬁtted to their places bid the men make haste said the to the centurion these he pointed to the must be dead by the of the sun and buried that the land may not be deﬁled such is the law with better mind soldier went to the nazarene and offered him something to drink but he refused the cup then another went to him and took from his neck the board with the inscription upon it which he nailed to the tree of the the preparation was complete the crosses are ready said the centurion to the pontif f who received the report with wave of the hand and the reply let the blasphemer go ﬁrst the son of god should be able to save himself we will the people to whom the preparation in its several stages was visible and who to this time had assailed the hill with incessant cries of impatience permitted lull which directly became universal hush the part of the inﬂiction most shocking at least to the thought was men were to be nailed to their crosses when that purpose the soldiers laid their hands upon the nazarene ﬁrst shudder passed through the great concourse project gutenberg https most brutalized shrank with dread afterwards there were those who said the air suddenly chilled and made them shiver how very still it is esther said she put her arm about her father s neck and remembering the torture he himse lf had suffered he drew her face down upon his breast and sat trembling avoid it esther avoid it he said i know not but all who stand and see innocent well the be cursed from this hour balthasar sank upon his knees son of hur said simonides with increasing excitement son of hur if jehovah stretch not forth his hand and quickly israel is we are answered calmly i have been in dream simonides and heard in it why all this should be and why it should go on it is the will of the is god s will let us the egyptian us hold our peace and pray he looked up on the knoll again the words were wafted to him through the awful i am the resurrection and the he bowed reverently to person speaking up on the summit meantime the work went on the guard took the nazarene s clothes from him so that he stood before the millions naked the stripes of the scour ging he had received in the early morning were still bloody upon his back yet he was laid pitilessly down and stretched upon the the arms upon the transverse beam the spikes were few blows and they were driven through the tender palms next they drew his knees up until the soles of the feet rested ﬂat upon the tree then they placed one foot upon the other and one spike ﬁxed both of them fast the dulled sound of the hammering was heard outside the guarded space and such could not hear yet saw the hammer it fell shivered with fear and withal not groan or cry or word of remonstrance from the sufferer nothing at which an enemy could laugh nothing lover could regret which way wilt thou have him faced asked soldier bluntly towards the temple the pontif f replied in dying i would have him see the holy house hath not suf fered by the workmen put their hands to the cross and carried it burden and all to the place of planting at word they dropped the tree into the hole and the body of the nazarene also dropped heavily and hung by the bleeding hands still cry of the exclamation divinest of all recorded exclamations father forgive them they know not what they the cross reared now above all other objects and standing singly out against the sky was greeted with burst of delight and all who could see and read the writing upon the board over the nazarene s head made haste to decip her it soon read the legend was adopted by them and communicated and presently the whole mighty concourse was ringing the salutation from side to side and repeating it with laughter and groans king of the jews hail king of the jews the pontif f with clearer idea of the import of the inscription protested against it but in vain so the titled king looking project gutenberg https knoll with dying eyes must have had the city of his fathers at rest below who had so ignominiously cast him out the sun was rising rapidly to noon the hills bared their brown breasts lovingly to it the more distant mountains rejoiced in the purple with which it so regally dressed them in the city the temples palaces towers pinnacles and all points of beauty and prominence seemed to lift themselves into the unrivalled brilliance if they knew the pride they were giving the many who from time to time turned to look at them suddenly dimness began to ﬁll the sky and cover the ﬁrst more than scarce perceptible fading of the day twilight out of time an evening gliding in upon the splendors of noon but it deepened and directly drew attention whereat the noise of the shouting and laughter fell off and men doubting their senses gazed at each other curiously then they looked to the sun again then at the mountains getting farther away at the sky and the near landscape sinking in shadow at the hill upon which the tragedy was enacting and from all these they gazed at each other again and turned pale and held their peace it is only mist or passing cloud simonides said soothingly to esther who was alarmed it will brighten presently did not think so it is not mist or cloud he said the spirits who live in the prophets and at work in mercy to themselves and nature i say to you simonides truly god lives he who hangs yonder is the son of and leaving simonides lost in wonder at such speech from him he went where balthasar was kneeling near by and laid his hand upon the good man s shoulder wise egyptian hearken thou alone wert nazarene is indeed the son of balthasar drew him down to him and replied feebly i saw him child in the manger where he was ﬁrst laid it is not strange that i knew him sooner than thou but oh that i should live to see this day would i had died with my brethren happy melchior happy happy gaspar comfort thee said doubtless they too are the dimness went on deepening into obscurity and that into positive darkness but without deterring the bolder spirits upon the knoll one after the other the thieves were raised on their crosses and the crosses planted the guard was then withdrawn and the people set free closed in upon the height and surged up it like conver ging wave man might take look when would push him on and take his place to be in turn pushed and there were laughter and ribaldry and revilements all the nazarene ha ha if thou be king of the jews save thyself soldier shouted ay said priest if he will come down to us now we will believe in others wagged their heads wisely saying he would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days but can not save others still he called himself the son of god let us see if god will have project gutenberg https all there is in prejudice one has ever said the nazarene had never harmed the people far the greater part of them had never seen him except in this his hour of calamity singular contrariety loaded him with their curses and gave their sympathy to the thieves the supernatural night dropped thus from the heavens affected esther it began to af fect thousands of others braver and stronger let us go home she three it is the frown of god father what other dreadful things may happen who can tell i am simonides was obstinate he said little but was plainly under great excitement observing about the end of the ﬁrst hour that the violence of the crowding up on the knoll was somewhat abated at his suggestion the party advanced to take position nearer the crosses gave his arm to balthasar yet the egyptian made the ascent with difﬁculty from their new stand the nazarene was imperfectly visible appearing to them not more than dark suspended ﬁgure they could hear him his sighing which showed an endurance or exhaustion greater than that of his ferers they ﬁlled every lull in the noises with their groans and entreaties the second hour after the suspension passed like the ﬁrst one to the nazarene they were hours of insult provocation and slow dying he spoke but once in the time some women came and knelt at the foot of his cross among them he recognized his mother with the beloved disciple woman he said raising his voice behold thy son and to the disciple behold thy mother the third hour came and still the peop le surged round the hill held to it by some strange attraction with which in probability the night in midday had much to they were quieter than in the preceding hour yet at intervals they could be heard off in the darkness shouting to each other multitude calling unto multitude it was noticeable also that coming now to the nazarene they approached his cross in silence took the look in silence and so departed this change extended even to the guard who so shortly before had cast lots the clothes of the cruciﬁed they stood with their ofﬁcers little apart more watchful of the one convict than of the throngs coming and going if he but breathed heavily or tossed his head in paroxysm of pain they were instantly on the alert most marvellous of all however was the altered behavior of the and his following the wise men who had assisted him in the trial in the night and in the victim s face kept place by him with zealous approval when the darkness began to fall they began to lose their conﬁdence there were among them many learned in astronomy and familiar with the apparitions so terrible in those days to the masses much of the knowledge was descended to them from their fathers far back some of it had been brought away at the end of the captivity and the necessities of the temple service kept it all bright these closed together when the sun commenced to fade before their eyes and the mountains and hills to recede they drew together in group around their pontif f and debated what they saw the moon is at its full they said with truth and this can not be an then one could answer the question common with them one could account the darkness or its occurrence at that project gutenberg https in their secret hearts they associated it with the nazarene and yielded to an alarm which the long continuance of the phenomenon steadily increased in their place behind the soldiers they noted every word and motion of the nazarene and hung with fear upon his sighs and talked in whispers the man might be the messiah and but they would wait and see in the meantime was not once visited by the old spirit the perfect peace abode with him he prayed simply that the end might be hastened he knew the condition of simonides that he was hesitating on the verge of belief he could see the massive face weighed down by solemn reﬂection he noticed him casting inquiring glances at the sun seeking the cause of the darkness nor did he fail to notice the solicitude with which esther clung to him smothering her fears to accommodate his wishes be not afraid he heard him say to her but stay and watch with thou mayst live twice the span of my life and see nothing of human interest equal to this and there may be revelations more let us stay to the when the third hour was about half gone some men of the rudest from the tombs about the and stopped in front of the centre cross this is he the new king of the jews said one of them the others cried with laughter hail all hail king of the jews receiving reply they went closer if thou be king of the jews or son of god come down they said loudly at this one of the thieves quit groaning and called to the nazarene y es if thou be christ save thyself and the people laughed and applauded then while they were listening reply the other felon was heard to say to the ﬁrst one dost thou not fear god we receive the due rewards of our deeds but this man hath done nothing the bystanders were astonished in the midst of the hush which ensued the second felon spoke again but this time to the nazarene lord he said remember when thou comest into thy simonides gave great start when thou comest into thy kingdom it was the very point of doub t in his mind the point he had so often debated with balthasar didst thou hear said to him the kingdom can not be of this world yon witness saith the king is but going to his kingdom and in ef fect i heard the same in my hush said simonides more imperiously than ever before in speech to hush i pray thee if the nazarene should and he spoke the nazarene did answer in clear voice full of conﬁdence verily i say unto thee shalt thou be with in paradise simonides waited to hear if that were all then he folded his hands and said more more lord the darkness is gone project gutenberg https with other balthasar i see with eyes of perfect the faithful servant had at last his ﬁtting reward his broken body might never be restored nor was there riddance of the recollection of his sufferings or recall of the years embittered by them but suddenly new life was shown him with assurance that it was new life lying just beyond this its name was paradise there he would ﬁnd the kingdom of which he had been dreaming and the king perfect peace fell upon him over the way in front of the cross however there were surprise and consternation the cunning casuists there put the assumption underlying the question and the admission underlying the answer together saying through the land that he was the messiah they had brought the nazarene to the cross and lo on the cross more conﬁdently than ever he had not only reasserted himself but promised enjoyment of his paradise to malefactor they trembled at what they were doing the pontif f with all his pride was afraid where got the man his conﬁdence except from truth and what should the truth be but god very little now would put them all to ﬂight the breathing of the nazarene grew harder his sighs became great gasps only three hours upon the cross and he was dying the intelligence was carried from man to man until every one knew it and then everything hushed the breeze faltered and died stiﬂing vapor loaded the air heat was superadded to darkness nor might any one unknowing the fact have thought that off the hill out under the overhanging pall there were three millions of people waiting what should happen were so still then there went out through the gloom over the heads of such were on the hill within hearing of the dying man cry of despair if not reproach my god my god why hast thou forsaken the voice startled all who heard it one it touched uncontrollably the soldiers in coming had brought with them vessel of wine and water and set it down little way from with sponge dipped into the liquor and put on the end of stick they could moisten the tongue of sufferer at their pleasure thought of the draught he had had at the well near nazareth an impulse seized him catching up the sponge he dipped it into the vessel and started the cross let him be the people in the way shouted angrily let him be without minding them he ran on and put the sponge to the nazarene s lips too late too late the face then plainly seen by bruised and black with blood and dust it was lighted neverth eless with sudden glow the eyes opened wide and ﬁxed upon some one visible to them alone in the far heavens and there were content and relief even triumph in the shout the victim gave it is ﬁnished it is ﬁnished so hero dying in the doing great deed celebrates his success with last cheer project gutenberg https light in the eyes went out slowly the crowned head sank upon the laboring breast thought the struggle over but the fainting soul recollected itself so that he and those around him caught the other and last words spoken in low voice if to one listening close by father into thy hands i commend my tremor shook the tortured body there was scream of ﬁercest anguish and the mission and the earthly life were over at once the heart with all its love was broken of that reader the man died went back to his friends saying simply it is over he is in space incredibly short the multitude was informed of the circumstance one repeated it aloud there was murmur which spread from the knoll in every direction murmur that was little more than whispering he is dead he is dead and that was all the people had their wish the nazarene was dead yet they stared at each other aghast his blood was upon them and while they stood staring at each other the ground commenced to shake each man took hold of his neighbor to supp ort himself in twinkling the darkness disappeared and the sun came out and everybody with the same glance beheld the crosses upon the hill all reeling in the earthquake they beheld all three of them but the one in the centre was arbitrary it alone would be seen and that it seemed to extend itself upwards and lift its burden and swing it to and fro higher and higher in the blue of the sky and every man among them who had jeered at the nazarene every one who had struck him every one who had voted to crucify him every one who had marched in the procession from the city every one who had in his heart wished him dead and they were ten to one felt that he was in some way individually singled out from the many and that if he would live he must get away quickly possible from that menace in the sky they started to run they ran with all their might on horseback and camels and in chariots they ran well on foot but then if it were mad at them what they had done and had taken up the cause of the unoffending and friendless dead the earthquake pursued them and tossed them about and ﬂung them down and terriﬁed them yet more by the horrible noise of great rocks grinding and rending beneath them they beat their breasts and shrieked with fear his blood was upon them the and the foreign priest and layman beggar sadducee pharisee were overtaken in the race and tumbled about indiscriminately if they called on the lord the outraged earth answered him in fury and dealt them all alike it did not even know wherein the was better than his guilty brethren overtaking him it tripped him up also and smirched the fringing of his robe and ﬁlled the golden bells with sand and his mouth with dust he and his people were alike in the one thing at the blood of the nazarene was upon them all when the sunlight broke upon the cruciﬁxion the mother of the nazarene the disciple and the faithful women of galilee the centurion and his soldiers and and his party were all who remained upon the hill these had not time to observe the ﬂight of the multitude they were too loudly called upon to take care of project gutenberg https seat thyself here said to esther making place her at her father s feet now cover thine eyes and look not up but put thy trust in god and the spirit of yon just man so foully nay said simonides reverently let us henceforth speak of him the be it so said presently wave of the earthquake struck the hill the shrieks of the thieves upon the reeling crosses were terrible to hear though giddy with the movements of the ground had time to look at balthasar and beheld him prostrate and still he ran to him and was reply the good man was dead then remembered to have heard cry in answer it were to the scream of the nazarene in his last moment but he had not looked to see from whom it had proceeded and ever after he believed the spirit of the egyptian accompanied that of his master over the boundary into the kingdom of paradise the idea rested not only upon the cry heard but upon the exceeding ﬁtness of the distinction if faith were worthy reward in the person of gaspar and love in that of melchior surely he should have some special meed who through long life and so excellently illustrated the three virtues in love and good works the servants of balthasar had deserted their master but when all was over the two galileans bore the old man in his litter back to the city it was sorrowful procession that entered the south gate of the palace of the hurs about the set of sun that memorable day about the same hour the body of the christ was taken down from the cross the remains of balthasar were carried to the all the servants hastened weeping to see him he had the love of every living thing with which he had in anywise to but when they beheld his face and the smile upon it they dried their tears saying it is well he is happier this evening than when he went out in the would not trust servant to inform iras what had befallen her father he went himself to see her and bring her to the body he imagined her grief she would now be alone in the world it was time to forgive and pity her he remembered he had not asked why she was not of the party in the morning or where she was he remembered he had not thought of her and from shame he was ready to make any amends the more so he was about to plunge her into such acute grief he shook the curtains of her door and though he heard the ringing of the little bells echoing within he had response he called her name and again he answer he drew the curtain aside and went into the room she was not there he ascended hastily to the roof in search of her nor was she there he questioned the servants none of them had seen her during the day after long quest everywhere through the house returned to the and took the place by the dead which should have been hers and he bethought him there how merciful the christ had been to his aged servant at the gate of the kingdom of paradise happily the afﬂictions of this life even its desertions are left behind and forgotten by those who go in and project gutenberg https the gloom of the burial was nigh gone on the ninth day after the healing the law being fulﬁlled brought his mother and tirzah home and from that day in that house the most sacred names possible of utterance by men were always coupled worshipfully together god the f ather and christ the son about ﬁve years after the cruciﬁxion esther the wife of hur sat in her room in the beautiful villa by misenum it was noon with warm italian sun making summer the roses and vines outside everything in the apartment was roman except that esther wore the garments of jewish matron tirzah and two children at play upon lion skin on the ﬂoor were her companions and one had only to observe how carefully she watched them to know that the little ones were hers time had treated her generously she was more than ever beautiful and in becoming mistress of the villa she had realized one of her cherished dreams in the midst of this simple scene servant appeared in the doorway and spoke to her woman in the atrium to speak with the let her come i will receive her presently the stranger entered at sight of her the jewess arose and was about to speak then she hesitated changed color and ﬁnally drew back saying i have known you good woman you i was iras the daughter of balthasar esther conquered her surprise and bade the servant bring the egyptian seat said iras coldly i will retire directly the two gazed at each other we know what esther beautiful woman happy mother contented wife on the other side it was very plain that fortune had not dealt so gently with her former rival the tall ﬁgure remained with some of its grace but an evil life had tainted the whole person the face was coarse the large eyes were red and pursed beneath the lower lids there was color in her cheeks the lips were cynical and hard and general neglect was leading rapidly to premature old age her attire was ill chosen and draggled the mud of the road clung to her sandals iras broke the painful silence these are thy children esther looked at them and smiled yes will you not speak to them i would scare them iras replied then she drew closer to esther and seeing her shrink said be not afraid give thy husband message tell him his enemy is dead and that the much misery he brought i slew his enemy the messala further tell thy husba nd that the harm i sought to him i have been punished until even he would pity tears arose in esther s eyes and she was about to project gutenberg https nay said iras i not want pity or tears tell him ﬁnally i have found that to be roman is to be brute she moved to go esther followed her stay and see my husband he has feeling against you he sought you everywhere he will be your friend i will be your friend we are the other was ﬁrm i am what i am of choice it will be over shortly but have we nothing you would wish nothing the countenance of the egyptian softened something like smile played about her lips she looked at the children upon the ﬂoor there is something she said esther followed her eyes and with quick perception answered it is iras went to them and knelt on the lion s skin and kissed them both rising slowly she looked at them then passed to the door and out of it without parting word she walked rapidly and was gone before esther could decide what to when he was told of the visit knew certainly what he had long on the day of the cruciﬁxion iras had deserted her father messala nevertheless he set out immediately and hunted her vainly they never saw her more or heard of her the blue bay with all its laughing under the sun has yet its dark secrets had it tongue it might tell us of the egyptian simonides lived to be very old man in the tenth year of nero s reign he gave up the business so long centred in the warehouse at antioch to the last he kept clear head and good heart and was successful one evening in the year named he sat in his on the terrace of the warehouse and esther and their three children were with him the last of the ships swung at mooring in the current of the river all the rest had been sold in the long interval between this and the day of the cruciﬁxion but one sorrow had befallen them that was when the mother of died and then and now their grief would have been greater but their christian faith the ship spoken of had arrived only the day before bringing intelligence of the persecution of christians begun by nero in rome and the party on the terrace were talking of the news when malluch who was still in their service approached and delivered package to who brings this the latter asked after reading an where is he he left immediately listen said to simonides he read then the following letter i ilderim the son of ilderim the generous and sheik of the tribe of ilderim to judah son of hur project gutenberg https know friend of my father s how my father loved you read what is herewith sent and you will know his will is my will therefore what he gave is thine all the parthians took

the son of hur who brought us such glory in the him and his forever dishonor not thy father ilderim the generous what say you asked of simonides esther took the papers pleased and read them to herself simonides remained silent his eyes were upon the ship but he was thinking at length he spoke son of hur he said gravely the lord has been good to you in these later years you have much to be thankful is it not time to decide ﬁnally the meaning of the gift of the great fortune now all in your hand and growing i decided that long ago the fortune was meant the service of the giver not part simonides but all of it the question with has been how can i make it most useful in his cause and of that tell i pray simonides answered the great sums you have given to the church here in antioch i am witness
