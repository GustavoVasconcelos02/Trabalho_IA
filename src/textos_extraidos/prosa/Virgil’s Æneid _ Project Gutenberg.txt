mæcenas very cleverly drew to his help writers whose work has since charmed the world we can almost pardon fate destroying the gave us virgil and horace pleasant indeed had it been virgil to sing in emulation of his great teacher lucretius he says ﬁrst of all i would pray that the charmin g muses whose minister i am the great love that has smitten would receive graciously and teach the courses of the stars in heaven the various eclipses of the sun and the earth what is the force by which the deep seas swell to the bursting of their barriers and settle down again on the winter suns make such

river and woodland with an unambitious then too there are the husbandman s sweet children ever hanging on his virtuous household keeps the tradition of purity ah yes to virgil most attractive was the simple life of the lover of nature and charmingly did he portray it in his eclogues and geor gics but augustus recognizing the genius of virgil and realizing the supreme need of reinvigorated patriotism urgently demanded an epic that should portray rome s beginnings and her signiﬁcance to the world reluctantly then virgil took up this task even at his death he considered it unfulﬁlled indeed it was his wish that the manuscript be destroyed almost immediately the æneid became the object of the closest study and ever since it has evoked the deepest admiration perhaps other secular writing has so profoundly af fected literature v irgil s l ife virgil publius vergilius maro born in the rural district near mantua farmer s son was given by his loving father careful education of his father virgil says those whom i have ever loved and above all my father the regard of his hero æneas his father anchises not merely illustrates the early roman ﬁlial suggests virgil s relation to his own parent in north italy virgil studied at mantua cremona and milan and at seventeen took up his wider studies at rome itself in the year 53 catullus had died the year before lucretius was dead two years at rome virgil had the best masters in greek rhetoric and in philosophy study in which he especially delighted in forming his own poetic style virgil was profoundly inﬂuenced by lucretius whose great poem on natur treated of the wondrous physical universe and by the subtly sweet young catullus ix x xi virgil s æneid project gutenberg https tenderest of roman in such studies virgil spent ten years but in 41 he appears again in north italy and this time in storm and stress in the year of philippi the triumvirs settling their victorious legions conﬁscated lands about cremona and virgil attempting to resist dispossession came near to losing his life through of the roman days he secured an introduction to octavius and was recovering his own farm or receiving in lieu of it an estate in campania virgil relates his experience in two of his ten eclogues which were published in their present form in 38 these charming poems were especial ly loved by milton and wordsworth macaulay indeed considered them the best of virgil s works at rome they met immediate success with the people and with octavius and his wise minister mæcenas horace s patron in them virgil tenderly sings love of friends home and country then virgil spent seven years on the four books of the geor gics publishing them in 29 two years after actium the geor gics merivale calls the gloriﬁcation of labor in them virgil hymns the farmer s life in beautiful italy hail to thee land of saturn mighty mother of noble fruits and noble men thee i essay the theme of the glory and the skill of olden virgil was now acknowledged the great est poet of italy in the year 26 one year after the title augustus had been conferred on octavius we ﬁnd the emperor writing virgil the most urgent letters begging the poet to send him then in spain some portion of the projected æneid it was however considerably later when virgil read to augustus the second fourth and sixth books the young marcellus the emperor s nephew died in 23 and we are told that octavia his mother fainted on hearing the poet read the immortal lines about her son in the sixth book child of nation s sorrow were there hope of thy breaking the tyranny of fate thou shalt be marcellus bring handfuls of lilies that i may strew the grave with their dazzling hues and crown if only with these gifts my young descendant s shade and perform the vain service of sorrow virgil who would write ten lines they say at dawn and lavish all the golden day to make them wealthier in his readers eyes had already spent some ten years on the æneid when in 19 he decided to devote three years to its revision and improvement amid the famous cities and scenes of greece and asia it is in anticipation of this voyage that his friend horace prays the winds to speed thee ship i pray thee to render virgil debt duly lent to thy charge whole and intact on the attican borders faithfully guarding the half of my augustus however met him at athens and persuaded him to accompany his own return but virgil was never again to see rome he contracted fever in greece it grew worse on the homeward trip and he died few days after landing in brundisium having reached the age

sped by sage æneas led and er the ocean waves in safety ﬂed destined from him though of his home bereft nobler dower to take than all that they had by martin some of the scholars indeed criticised it having an undue simplicity coining new words and using old words with new meanings borrowing too freely from homer not written in chronological order containing anachronisms etc but within ten years it was familiarly quoted by writers we quote shakespeare it became the chief book in the roman schools of grammar and rhetoric the great writers of later days like pliny and tacitus show the profound inﬂuence of his style which would seem to have gripped them goethe tells us luther s translation of the scriptures affected his style and the king james version has left its indelible traces on english literature when the tired of problems of government and law and turned strongly to the problems of religion easily to be sure to superstition was evidence of virgil s grip on humanity that the poet of poets became the wizard of wizards even under the antonines the sors vergiliana virgilian prophecy was practised the æneid was opened at random and the ﬁrst verse that struck the eye was considered prophecy of good or bad portent the mediæval world looked upon him poet of prophetic insight who contained within himself all the potentialities of wisdom he was called the poet if other existed the roman if the ideal of the commonwealth were embodied in him the perfect in style with whom other writer could be compared the philosopher who grasped the ideas of all things the wise one whose comprehension seemed to other mortals unlimited his writings became the bible of race the mysteries of roman priestcraft the processes of divination the science of the stars were all found in his true indeed are the words of professor macmechan beginning the æneid is like setting out upon broad and beaten highway along which countless feet have passed in the course of nineteen centuries it is spiritual highway winding through every age and every clime and these of professor woodberry the æneid shows that characteristic of greatness in literature which lies in its being watershed of time it looks back to antiquity in all that clothes it with the past of imagination character and event and forward to christian times in all that clothes it with emotion sentiment and ﬁnality to the xiv

plains with their own new sun and stars before unknown ah not frustra pius was virgil you say horace in your melancholy song in him we fancy there was happier mood than your melancholy t he pic i tself the purpose of the epic is to indicate the divinely ordained origin and history of rome conquering civilizing and organizing government destined to replace both anarchy and tyrannical despotism by liberty under law the real reason rome s existence is so commonly overlooked let us recall mommsen s words in the introduction to his provinces of the roman empir it fostered the peace and prosperity of the many nations united under its sway longer and more completely than any other leading power has ever succeeded in doing if an angel of the lord were to strike the balance whether the domain ruled by severus antoninus was governed with the greater intelligence and the greater humanity at that time or in the present day whether civilization and national prosperity generally have since that time advanced or retrograded it is very doubtful whether the decision would prove in favor of the virgil states the function of rome clearly in the famous passage of the sixth book wherein greek and roman are compared forget not roman thy rule in thy might er the nations this is to be thine to the world to xvii xviii virgil s æneid project gutenberg https the hero æneas himself of

compensating fate rome s conquest of greek is but loyal to her trojan ancestry the duel to the death with semitic queen once was the stately dido left by king æneas at jove s command incidentally too virgil draws from trojan origins governmental forms religious rites yes even games while this great task of glorifying patriotism and harmonizing it with loyalty to cæsar is ever present to virgil he can not lose two qualities that make him the most modern of ancient love of nature and his pathos the former it sufﬁces to cite the charming harbor scene succeeding storm and wreck in the ﬁrst book and of the latter the of the immortal twain nisus and euryalus in book nine down falls euryalus in death over his beauteous limbs gushes the blood and his powerless neck sinks on his shoulders when purple ﬂower severed by the plough pines in death or poppies with faint necks droop the head when rain has chanced to weigh them down but nisus rushes full on the foe and dying robs his foe of life

your names from the memory of time so long the house of æneas shall dwell on the capitol s moveless rock and roman father shall be the world s t he s tor y the story on which virgil builds is brieﬂy the fall of troy the voyaging of trojan refugees under æneas and the successful wars of æneas with italian barbarians according to the ancient legend the greeks had warred ten years under troy s walls because the trojan prince paris having awarded the prize of beauty to venus against juno and minerva and having been promised reward by venus helen the beautiful wife of the greek menelaus had eloped with that fatal beauty to troy and his father king priam had refused to make restitution the story then related by æneas to queen dido in her palace at carthage takes up in the second book of the æneid the downfall and destruction of troy with the escape of æneas his father and son together with band of trojans then in the third book are depicted their voyagings unsuccessful attempts to found cities and arrival in sicily here father anchises dies from sicily they sail in the endeavor to reach latium in italy it is at this point that the epic begins so after his invocation and introduction in book one virgil makes unrelenting juno through the æolus let loose upon the trojan ﬂeet ﬁerce tempest which drives the remnant of the ﬂeet far away to the carthaginian coast æneas directed by his disguised mother venus comes to the court of dido by whom he is kindly received banqueted and at her request narrates in books two and three his harsh experiences book four continues the dido episode the queen madly loves through the inﬂuence of venus who else had feared carthaginian hostility to her dear trojans xix xx virgil s æneid project gutenberg https thinks to thwart the fates and jove s

sending messenger to incite the trojan women to set the ﬂeet on ﬁre but this attempt is only successful in so far it leads æneas to leave the weaklings under the kindly sway of their kinsman the sicilian chief acestes the rest sail italy losing the faithful pilot palinurus book six details the visit æneas under the guidance of the sibyl to the abode of the dead there he meets again his father anchises who passes in review souls about to be reborn into the upper world their heroic descendants so far with the exception of book two which recorded the fall and sack of troy theme omitted by homer virgil has recorded the odyssey or wanderings of his hero æneas now in the succeeding six books is given the iliad or wars of æneas in italy he lands king latinus is divinely led to promise æneas his daughter lavinia but she has been betrothed to turnus under juno s prompting then begins this tremendous duel between æneas and turnus and here we note curious likeness between milton and virgil our sympathies are aroused in the paradise lost lucifer so turnus the reckless one looms up ﬁgure of heroic size doomed by the fates to die that rome may live sources virgil s sources his story and indeed small portion of his languag may be mentioned preeminently homer s odyssey and iliad euripides with his droppings of warm tears the greek epic poets called the cyclic poets dealing with the cycle of story revolving around troy the greek freedman and teacher livius andronicus who translated roughly the odyssey nævius who wrote on the first punic war tracing carthaginian hostility back to the æneas visit and especially enniu s father of latin literature who in great epic traced the history of rome from æneas down of virgil s borrowings it were enough perhaps to say that like our shakespeare he ennobled what he borrowed wove it into the texture of his it virgilian t he t ransla tion concerning the translation itself we should perhaps set over against emerson s famous saying i
